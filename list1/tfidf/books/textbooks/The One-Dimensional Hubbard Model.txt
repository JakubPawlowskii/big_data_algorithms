THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL HUBBARD MODEL
The description of a solid at a microscopic level is complex, involving the interaction of
a huge number of its constituents, such as ions or electrons. It is impossible to solve the
corresponding many-body problems analytically or numerically, although much insight can
be gained from the analysis of simpliﬁed models. An important example is the Hubbard
model, which describes interacting electrons in narrow energy bands, and which has been
applied to problems as diverse as high-Tc superconductivity, band magnetism and the metalinsulator transition.
Remarkably, the one-dimensional Hubbard model can be solved exactly using the Bethe
ansatz method. The resulting solution has become a laboratory for theoretical studies of
non-perturbative effects in strongly correlated electron systems. Many methods devised to
analyse such effects have been applied to this model, both to provide complementary insight
into what is known from the exact solution and as an ultimate test of their quality.
This book presents a coherent, self-contained account of the exact solution of the Hubbard
model in one dimension. The early chapters develop a self-contained introduction to Bethe’s
ansatz and its application to the one-dimensional Hubbard model, and will be accessible to
beginning graduate students with a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and statistical
mechanics. The later chapters address more advanced topics, and are intended as a guide
for researchers to some of the more recent scientiﬁc results in the ﬁeld of integrable models.
The authors are distinguished researchers in the ﬁeld of condensed matter physics and
integrable systems, and have contributed signiﬁcantly to the present understanding of the
one-dimensional Hubbard model. Fabian Essler is a University Lecturer in Condensed

Preface

On account of Lieb and Wu’s 1968 Bethe ansatz solution, the one-dimensional Hubbard
model has become a laboratory for theoretical studies of non-perturbative effects in strongly
correlated electron systems. Many of the tools available for the analysis of such systems have
been applied to this model, both to provide complementary insights to what is known from
the exact solution or as an ultimate test of their quality. In parallel, due to the synthesis of new
quasi one-dimensional materials and the reﬁnement of experimental techniques, the onedimensional Hubbard model has evolved from a toy model to a paradigm of experimental
relevance for strongly correlated electron systems.
Due to the ongoing efforts to improve our understanding of one-dimensional correlated
electron systems, there exists a large number of review articles and books covering various
aspects of the general theory, as well as the Bethe ansatz and ﬁeld theoretical methods. A
collection of these works is listed in the General Bibliography below.
Still we felt – and many of our colleagues shared this view – that there would be a need for
a coherent account of all of these aspects in a uniﬁed framework and from the perspective of
the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which, moreover, would be accessible to beginners in
the ﬁeld. This motivated us to write this volume. It is intended to serve both as a textbook and
as a monograph. The ﬁrst chapters are supposed to provide a self-contained introduction
to Bethe’s ansatz and its application to the one-dimensional Hubbard model, accessible
to beginning graduate students with only a basic knowledge of Quantum Mechanics and
Statistical Mechanics. The later chapters address more advanced issues and are intended to
guide the interested researcher to some of the more recent scientiﬁc developments in the
ﬁeld of integrable models.
Although this book concentrates on the one-dimensional Hubbard model, we would like
to stress that the methods used in its solution are general in the sense that they apply equally
well to other integrable models, some of which we actually deal with in passing. In fact, the
application of Bethe’s ansatz to the Hubbard model is more involved than in other cases.
We expect the reader who has mastered the solution of the Hubbard model to be able to
apply his/her knowledge readily to other integrable theories.
This volume does not pretend to cover its subject completely. Rather, we attempted to
ﬁnd a balance between being didactic and being comprehensive. Our selection of material

xi

Preface

was necessarily governed by our predispositions. We apologize if we have failed to cover
important issues adequately.
Ultimately this book originates in the many collaborations between the authors over
the last ten years, which are documented in the reference section at the end of the book.
Although the material presented has matured in the discussions between us, it is not difﬁcult
to infer from our different styles which author bears primary responsibility for which chapter,
namely FG for chapters 2, 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, FHLE for chapters 4–7, 10 and 17, HF for
chapters 8 and 9, AK for chapter 13, VEK for chapter 16, and FG and FHLE jointly for
chapter 1.
Throughout this project and in many fruitful collaborations before we have beneﬁtted
immeasurably from numerous discussions with our colleagues and friends A. M. Tsvelik,
N. d’Ambrumenil, T. Deguchi, H. Fehske, F. Gebhard, F. D. M. Haldane, V. I. Inozemtsev,

are due to Andreas Schadschneider for discussions and his constructive criticism after
reading the entire manuscript. We are grateful to M. Bortz, A. Fledderjohann, M. Karbach,
P. Boykens, A. Grage, M. Hartung, R. M. Konik and A. Seel for proofreading parts of the
manuscript and helpful comments.
Despite the joint efforts of many dear friends we do not expect the ﬁrst edition of such a
thick volume to be free of misprints. We plan to keep a record of all misprints brought to
our knowledge on our personal websites.
We thank the Physics Departments at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Universities of Bayreuth, Dortmund, Hannover, Stony Brook, Warwick and Wuppertal for providing

Introduction

The purpose of this opening chapter is threefold: to introduce the Hubbard model, to discuss
its origin and signiﬁcance and to give a brief summary of its history. Rather than beginning
with more general and historical considerations we will start with a concrete albeit somewhat technical discussion of how the Hubbard model arises as an effective description of
electronic degrees of freedom in solids.
1.1 On the origin of the Hubbard model
The Hubbard model is named after John Hubbard, who in a series of inﬂuential articles [201–206] introduced1 the Hamiltonian in order to model electronic correlations in
narrow energy bands and proposed a number of approximate treatments of the associated
many-body problem. Our following discussion of how the Hubbard Hamiltonian arises in
an approximate description of interacting electrons in a solid loosely parallels Hubbard’s
original work. We will assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of solid
state theory (see e.g. [25, 509]) and with the formalism of second quantization (e.g. [283]).
For further reading we refer to the original literature [188, 201, 233] and to the monographs [27, 158, 498].
A solid consists of ions and electrons condensed in a three-dimensional crystalline structure. Since the ions are much heavier than the electrons, it is often a good phenomenological
starting point for the exploration of the electronic properties of solids to think of the ions
as forming a static lattice.2 In this approximation the dynamics of the electrons is governed
by the Hamiltonian

where N is the number of electrons, VI (x) is the periodic potential of the ions and

The Hubbard model was independently introduced by Gutzwiller [188] and Kanamori [233] around the same time.
This can be further justiﬁed within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [68].

Introduction

In spite of the drastic approximation we made by assuming a static lattice the Hamiltonian
(1.1) is far too complicated to be solved exactly. It still bears all the difﬁculties of a generic
many-body system. Much of the success of solid state theory derives from efﬁcient ‘meanﬁeld’ one-particle approximations to (1.1). On a technical level these approximations are
based on adding an auxiliary potential V A (x) to the one-particle piece of the Hamiltonian
(1.1) and then subtracting it again in the two-body part, i.e. we may write

N  2

H=
+ V (xi ) +
U (xi , x j ) ,
(1.3)

1≤i< j≤N
where we introduced effective one- and two-body potentials V (x) and U (x, y) as
V (x) = VI (x) + V A (x) ,
U (x, y) = VC (x − y) − N 1−1





V A (x) + V A (y) .

(1.4a)
(1.4b)

Mean-ﬁeld approximations to H amount to simply setting U (x, y) equal to zero. In order
for this to be sensible, the auxiliary potential needs to be chosen in such a way, that the
matrix elements of the effective two-body potential U (x, y) between the eigenstates of the
one-particle Hamiltonian
h 1 (x, p) =

become small. Even in circumstances when this cannot be achieved, the two-body interaction
U (x, y) may still be considerably reduced in range and magnitude compared to the full
Coulomb interaction VC (x − y).
The physical idea behind the introduction of the auxiliary potential V A (x) may be formulated as follows. Let us assume we have a large number N of electrons in the ground
state 0 of the Hamiltonian H . If we insert an additional electron locally into the system,
what potential does it feel? Superimposed on the periodic potential of the ions it feels the
electro-static potential which stems from the ground state density |0 (x1 , . . . , x N )|2 of the
other electrons. This potential is periodic with the same periods as the ionic potential. It is,
however, of the opposite sign and therefore screens the attractive interaction of the ions.
Of course, this picture is only approximately correct because the additional electron itself
causes a change in the ground state density. Still, we may imagine that (again because of
the screening) the effect of the additional electron is only local and therefore small.
We now wish to ‘second-quantize’ the Hamiltonian (1.3) in a suitable basis of states. In
order to construct this basis we consider eigenstates of the one-particle Hamiltonian h 1 .
Since the one-body potential V (x) in (1.4a) is periodic, the eigenfunctions of h 1 are Bloch
functions (see e.g. [25, 509]), i.e., they are of the form
ϕαk (x) = eik·x u αk (x) .

(1.6)

Here u αk (x) has the periodicity of the lattice, k is the quasi momentum and α the band index.
The quasi momentum vector k runs over the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. Being eigenfunctions of

the functions ϕαk (x) constitute a basis of one-particle states.
A complementary one-particle basis is provided by the Wannier functions [25, 509]

We note that H in equation (1.13) is still completely equivalent to the ﬁrst quantized Hamiltonian (1.1). An optimal choice of the Wannier functions φα (x) through
an optimal choice of the auxiliary potential V A (x) minimizes the inﬂuence of the mutual Coulomb interaction. When the interaction parameters are small compared to the
hopping matrix elements, they can be set equal to zero in a ﬁrst approximation, and
can later be taken into account by perturbation theory. This is the realm of band
theory.
The Hubbard model is obtained from (1.13) when the interaction parameters are no longer
negligible, but their range is still very small, i.e., when the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction
αβγ δ
Uiiii is large compared to the inter atomic interaction parameters and, at the same time,
cannot be neglected compared to the hopping matrix elements. This situation is believed to
be characteristic for transition and rare earth metals.
When the Fermi surface lies inside a single conduction band, say α = 1, it is sometimes
justiﬁed to ‘project’ the multi-band Hamiltonian onto an effective one-band model. Let us
imagine a situation where the interband interactions are weak and at the same time all bands
except the α = 1 conduction band are far away from the Fermi level. As long as we are
interested only in energies in the vicinity of the Fermi level, the main effect of the high
energy bands is to change the hopping and interaction parameters of the electrons in the
conduction band. Then we may replace the multi-band Hamiltonian (1.13) by a one-band

Whereas the hopping matrix elements can usually be determined accurately in the framework of density-functional theory (see e.g. [106]), the effective interaction parameter U is
much more difﬁcult to estimate and is perhaps best ﬁxed by comparing theoretical predictions to experimental results.
It has to be said that the Hamiltonian (1.16) is not expected to describe the transition or
rare earth metals quantitatively, since the interaction between overlapping bands is important in both cases. The Hamiltonian (1.16) is most appropriately regarded as an effective
Hamiltonian that is believed to capture, at least qualitatively, some of the electronic features
of the transition metals.
A further simpliﬁcation of the Hamiltonian, which is compatible with the assumption
that the Wannier functions φα (x − Ri ) are strongly localized around Ri is the tight-binding

Here the symbol i, j denotes summation over ordered pairs of nearest neighbours. We have
assumed isotropic hopping of strength −t between nearest neighbours and have suppressed
the on-site terms tii , since they may be absorbed into the chemical potential in a grand
canonical description of the model.
The one-dimensional version of the Hamiltonian (1.17) is easily identiﬁed with the
Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.1) of Chapter 2 which is the actual starting point of this book. Its
peculiar charm is certainly due to the fact that, in spite of its simplicity, it cannot be reduced
to a one-particle theory and for this reason shows a rich spectrum of physical phenomena.
1.2 The Hubbard model – a paradigm in condensed matter physics
One of the most successful descriptions of electrons in solids is band theory. It is based on
reducing many-body interactions to an effective one-body description, i.e., on neglecting
the two-body potential U (x, y) in equation (1.4b) or equivalently the interaction parameters
αβγ δ
Ui jkl in equation (1.13). However, there are various situations of physical interest where
band theory fails by construction. Arguably the most prominent example are Mott insulators:
these have an odd number of valence electrons per elementary cell and yet are insulating,
in contradiction with predictions of band theory.
One of the main motivations for studying the Hubbard model is that it is the simplest
generalization beyond the band theory description of solids, yet still appears to capture
the gross physical features of many systems characterized by more general interaction
parameters in (1.13). The Hubbard model has been used in attempts to describe
(i) the electronic properties of solids with narrow bands,
(ii) band magnetism in iron, cobalt, nickel,
(iii) the Mott metal-insulator transition,
(iv) electronic properties of high-Tc cuprates in the normal state.
Despite its apparent simplicity, no fully consistent treatment of the Hubbard model is
available in general. However, there are two cases in which one is more fortunate and many
properties are calculable, namely the extremes of lattice coordination numbers two and
inﬁnity.3 One might naively expect that the latter case can be easily understood by means of
a mean-ﬁeld approximation. Surprisingly, there is a particular way [325] of performing the
limit of inﬁnite lattice ‘dimension’ D → ∞, in which the behaviour of the Hubbard model
does not become mean-ﬁeld like, but the model remains tractable. A striking result obtained
in this approach is an understanding of the Mott transition between a paramagnetic metal
and a correlated insulator. For details we refer the interested reader to the review article [163]
and to the monograph [158].

Notice that a few rigorous results [294, 452] also hold in the general case of arbitrary lattice dimension.

Introduction

Here we are concerned with the ﬁrst case, which corresponds to a one-dimensional
lattice. The one-dimensional Hubbard model has a distinctive feature: it is ‘integrable’.
This essentially means that many physical properties can be determined exactly.4 Integrable
models are rather special and occur mostly in D = 1. Integrability is a fragile property:
adding extra terms to an integrable Hamiltonian will in general break it. This fact is a frequent
source of criticism. However, often the physics of a given problem is more robust than the
mathematics: adding small perturbations to a given Hamiltonian does not necessarily lead
to any dramatic changes in the physical properties. This point can be made more precise in
the context of universality classes of critical behaviour (see e.g. [76]). By the same token the
1D Hubbard model may yet prove to be directly relevant for the description of experiments.
In our view, the central importance of integrable models rests with the fact that they
constitute paradigms of diverse physical phenomena, which can be understood and characterized in their entirety. They allow us to study many-body physics beyond the restrictions
of perturbation theory or intuitive non-systematic approximations. Their analysis permits
us to develop an intuitive understanding of ‘non-perturbative’ effects. Last but not least,
integrable models provide benchmarks for the development of approximate and numerical
methods.

1.2.1 Integrable models
The history of exactly solvable many-body quantum systems traces back to H. Bethe’s
1931 article [60] on the spin- 12 Heisenberg chain in the early days of Quantum Theory.
Bethe constructed the many-body wave functions and reduced the problem of calculating
the spectrum of the Hamiltonian to solving a set of N coupled algebraic equations (‘Bethe
ansatz equations’), where N is the number of overturned spins. In this way a problem of
exponential complexity is reduced to one of polynomial complexity. Bethe’s work provides
an explicit answer for the ground state properties and excitations of the ferromagnetic
Heisenberg model. The energy per lattice site in the antiferromagnetic ground state was
calculated by L. Hulthén in [207]. Hulthén recognized that in the thermodynamic limit the
ground state can be characterized by the solution of a linear integral equation.
At the time Bethe’s work was considered to be a fascinating but mostly academic exercise
and it was hoped that it might serve as a stepping stone on the path to a solution of Heisenberg
models on two- and three-dimensional lattices. Since then, Bethe’s work has remained a
constant source of inspiration for generations of researchers in theoretical and mathematical
physics. It marked the beginning of a new branch of mathematical physics, the theory of
exactly solvable quantum systems.
The next milestone was reached in 1944 [350] with L. Onsager’s solution of the twodimensional Ising model, which is based on an inﬁnite-dimensional symmetry algebra
(‘Onsager Algebra’) and a transfer matrix approach. Furthermore, the ‘star-triangle relation’,
which played a crucial role in many subsequent developments, was mentioned for the ﬁrst

time. Onsager’s work had a lasting impact on the microscopic foundations of the general
theory of phase transitions. It established that singularities in the free energy can be obtained
by a direct calculation of the partition function of a microscopic model. Furthermore, the
solution demonstrated that critical exponents need not be mean-ﬁeld like.
New applications of Bethe’s ansatz were discovered during the 1960s, starting with the
work [296] of E. H. Lieb and W. Liniger on the Bose gas with delta-function interactions. The
extension of Bethe’s ansatz to problems in statistical mechanics was achieved by E. H. Lieb
in his solution of three archetypical cases of the six-vertex model (ice, KDP, F) [290–292].
The general case was solved shortly after by B. Sutherland [422] (for a review see [299]).
The generalization of Bethe’s ansatz to models with internal degrees of freedom like
spin proved to be very hard, because scattering involves changes of the internal states of
the scatterers. This problem was eventually solved by C. N. Yang [493] and M. Gaudin
[154] by means of what is nowadays called ‘nested Bethe ansatz’. The condition for the
applicability of the nested Bethe ansatz is the consistent factorization of multi-particle
scattering processes into two-particle ones. Consistency requires the two-particle scattering
matrices to fulﬁll certain algebraic equations, the ‘Yang-Baxter Equations’.
In 1969 C. N. Yang and C. P. Yang [496] showed that Bethe’s ansatz allows for the calculation of ﬁnite temperature properties of the delta-function Bose gas. This astonishing result
is the ﬁrst exact treatment of the thermodynamics of an interacting many-body quantum
system.
Starting from the observation that the eigenstates of the transfer matrix of the six-vertex
model are independent of one of the parameters, R. J. Baxter realized that there must be an
entire family of commuting transfer matrices. He discovered a simple explanation of this
remarkable fact by showing that it follows from ternary relations for the local Boltzmann
weights [45]. These relations are a sufﬁcient condition for the solvability of the model and
are identical to the Yang-Baxter Equations obtained previously by Yang in his construction
of the nested Bethe ansatz. Using his insights, Baxter realized the equivalence of the YangBaxter Equations to Onsager’s star-triangle relations. He also discovered that the Boltzmann
weights of an eight-vertex model satisfy the Yang-Baxter Equations, establishing solvability
in the sense of the existence of a family of commuting transfer matrices [43,44]. Interestingly
the model cannot be solved by Bethe’s ansatz. However, Baxter managed to develop novel
methods for the calculation of partition functions as well as one-point functions [45].
The role of the Yang-Baxter Equations as the deﬁning structure of integrable models was
emphasized by L. D. Faddeev, E. K. Sklyanin and L. Takhtajan and other members of the
St Petersburg branch of the Stekhlov Mathematical Institute. They established a relation
between quantum many-body models solved by Bethe’s ansatz and classical integrable
evolution equations [404,410,411]. Building on this connection, they initiated a systematic
search for solutions of the Yang-Baxter Equations [274,276] and developed a programme for
the solution of integrable models they called the ‘Quantum Inverse Scattering Method’. An
important element of this method is the algebraization of the construction of eigenstates of
the transfer matrix [132,445]. The developments initiated by the Stekhlov group culminated
in the advent of ‘Quantum Groups’ [107, 225].

Introduction

1.2.2 Bethe ansatz solution of the Hubbard model
The history of the one-dimensional Hubbard model as an exactly solvable model began in
1968 with E. H. Lieb and F. Y. Wu’s article [298]. Lieb and Wu discovered that Bethe’s ansatz
can be applied to the Hubbard model and reduced the spectral problem of the Hamiltonian
to solving a set of algebraic equations, nowadays known as the Lieb-Wu equations (see
Chapter 3). They succeeded in calculating the ground state energy and demonstrated that
the Hubbard model undergoes a Mott metal-insulator transition at half ﬁlling (one electron
per site) with critical interaction strength U = 0 (Chapter 6).5
In the 35 years since Lieb and Wu’s fundamental work appeared in print there have been
hundreds of publications on the subject. It is clearly an impossible feat to do all of them
justice within the conﬁnes of this short introduction. Hence we will constrain the following
discussion to a small selection of works, which in our very personal and subjective view
are of particular importance.
In 1972 M. Takahashi [435] proposed a classiﬁcation of the solutions of the Lieb-Wu
equations in terms of a ‘string hypothesis’ (see Chapter 4). He employed this hypothesis
to replace the Lieb-Wu equations by simpler ones and then proceeded to derive a set of
non-linear integral equations, which determine the Gibbs free energy of the Hubbard model
(Chapter 5). These integral equations are known as thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA)
equations. Solving them in the limit of small temperatures Takahashi calculated the speciﬁc
heat [436]. Later on a more complete picture of the thermodynamics of the Hubbard model
was obtained from numerical solutions of the TBA equations [240, 469].
In fact, Takahashi’s equations, in conjunction with the TBA equations, can be used
to calculate any physical quantity that pertains to the energy spectrum of the Hubbard
model. In particular, the dispersion curves of all elementary excitations can be obtained
from the TBA equations in the limit T → 0 [95]. Constraints on the quantum numbers in
Takahashi’s equations imply certain selection rules that determine the allowed combinations
of elementary excitations and therefore the physical excitation spectrum [95]. Historically,
the pioneering works in which ground state properties [298, 396, 429, 492] and the excitation
spectrum [88,258,352,481,482,485,486]) were determined followed a different approach.
In our view the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz is perhaps the most systematic approach
for studying the ground state and the physical excitation spectrum of the one-dimensional
Hubbard model and will serve as the basis of the corresponding Chapters 6 and 7 of this
book.
Takahashi’s equations may also serve as starting point for the calculation of the scattering matrix of the elementary excitations. For the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model in vanishing
magnetic ﬁeld the S-matrix was calculated in [120, 121]. It was shown that the excitation
spectrum at half ﬁlling is given by scattering states of four elementary excitations: holon
and antiholon with spin 0 and charge ±e and charge neutral spinons with spin up or down
respectively. This is remarkable, since away from half ﬁlling, or at ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld, the
number of elementary excitations is inﬁnite [95]. It was further shown in [120, 121] that

the four particles can only be excited in SO(4) multiplets (for the SO(4) symmetry of the
model see Chapters 2 and 3).
A new chapter in the analysis of integrable models was opened with the advent of Conformal Field Theory [51]. In conformally invariant one-dimensional quantum systems the
critical exponents governing the power-law decay of correlation functions are directly related to the energy levels in a large ﬁnite volume [6, 62, 74, 75]. Fortuitously in integrable
theories the ﬁnite-size corrections to the energies of the ground state and low lying excited
states can be determined from the Bethe ansatz [470]. The relations derived in [6,62,75] have
been applied to numerous integrable models, including the attractive Hubbard model [65],
which are conformally invariant in the low energy limit. Systematic studies of the ﬁnite size
corrections in the spectrum of the Hubbard model were performed in the late eighties starting
with work on the half-ﬁlled case [489]. The generic ﬁnite size spectrum away from half ﬁlling in ﬁnite magnetic ﬁelds was eventually obtained by F. Woynarovich [487]. In [140,141]
the aforementioned relation between the ﬁnite-size spectrum and the asymptotic behaviour
of correlation functions was extended to models with several critical degrees of freedom
and then utilized to calculate the critical exponents of general two-point correlation functions for the repulsive Hubbard model using Woynarovich’s results (see Chapter 9). This
was a breakthrough in the understanding of correlations in interacting one-dimensional
quantum systems. The method has subsequently been applied to many other integrable
models.
When considering a ﬁnite volume, an issue arises which we have hitherto ignored, namely
the boundary conditions imposed on the system. In Lieb and Wu’s work periodic boundary
conditions were chosen. In 1985, the Hubbard model with reﬂecting ends was solved by
H. Schulz [380] by means of a method introduced by M. Gaudin [155] for the δ-function
Bose gas enclosed in a box and the open spin- 12 Heisenberg chain.
The ‘conformal approach’ provides information on the large-distance/low-energy behaviour of correlation functions in the Hubbard model for band ﬁllings strictly larger
than zero and strictly less than one, for all positive values of U and low temperatures.
In the Mott insulating phase at half ﬁlling the conformal approach is not applicable. However, in the small-U and scaling limits [324, 490, 491] methods of integrable quantum
ﬁeld theory can be employed to determine dynamical correlation functions at low energies [89, 105, 128, 129, 224] (Chapter 10). Another phase where the conformal approach is
not applicable is the so-called gas phase characterized by sufﬁciently negative chemical potential and hence describing a correlated band insulator. The large-distance asymptotics of
ﬁnite temperature correlation functions in the gas phase can be obtained exactly by a Bethe
ansatz based approach [173, 176] (see Chapter 11). In the strong coupling limit U → ∞ at
zero temperature it is possible to obtain information about correlation functions at all energy
scales by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques [153,160,344,345,353–358]
for all band ﬁllings.
The Bethe ansatz solution also supplies the coordinate wave functions of eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian. An explicit representation for the wave functions was given by F. Woynarovich
[481]. Only much later [122, 125] it was proven that the corresponding eigenstates are

10

Introduction

highest weight states with respect to the SO(4) symmetry [197, 497] of the Hamiltonian
(Chapter 3). Combining this result with the implications of the string hypothesis it became
possible to give a completeness argument in [123] (Chapter 4). Unfortunately the Bethe
ansatz wave functions appear to be too complicated to allow for a direct calculation of
correlation functions. Even an expression for the norms (Chapter 3) of the eigenstates has
only been conjectured [175] and is still awaiting a proof.
In 1986 B. S. Shastry opened up a new way for studying the Hubbard model by placing
it into the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method. Using a Jordan-Wigner
transformation he mapped the Hubbard model to a spin model and then demonstrated that
the resulting spin Hamiltonian commutes with the transfer matrix of a related covering
vertex model [392]. In [391] Shastry ﬁrst obtained the R-matrix of the spin model, thus
embedding it into the general classiﬁcation of ‘integrable models’ (see Chapter 12). Alternative derivations were obtained in [393] and in [348, 349, 475]. The latter references
also include a formulation in terms of fermions that applies more directly to the Hubbard
model.
It then took about ten years before Shastry’s construction was really utilized. In [401]
it was shown that Shastry’s R-matrix satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation. An algebraic
Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model was constructed in [320, 371] and expressions for the
eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the two-dimensional statistical covering model were
obtained (see also [499]). This result was of crucial importance for the quantum transfer
matrix approach to the thermodynamics [232] of the Hubbard model (Chapter 13). This
approach allows for a drastically simpliﬁed description of the thermodynamics in terms of
the solution of a ﬁnite set of nonlinear integral equations, rather than the inﬁnite set originally obtained by Takahashi in 1972 [435]. Within the quantum transfer matrix approach
thermodynamic quantities can be calculated numerically with a very high precision. The
approach can be extended to the calculation of correlation lengths at ﬁnite temperature
[459, 465].
Another important algebraic result, which was unrelated to Shastry’s work at ﬁrst sight,
was the discovery of a quantum group symmetry of the Hubbard model on the inﬁnite
line (see Chapter 14): the Hamiltonian is invariant under the direct sum of two Y(sl(2))
Yangians [462] (see also [172]). The relation of these Yangians to Shastry’s R-matrix and the
implications of one of these Yangians for the structure of the bare excitations (Chapter 15)
were clariﬁed in [335, 336].

1.2.3 The one-dimensional Hubbard model and experiments
The one-dimensional Hubbard model has been of immense conceptual value in facilitating
the interpretation of experiments on quasi one-dimensional materials. Although it is not
strictly a perfect model for any existing material, many of its qualitative features seem to
be realized in nature. At present there is a sizeable list of materials, for which the electronic
degrees of freedom are believed to be described by ‘Hubbard-like’ Hamiltonians. Examples

1.3 External ﬁelds

11

are the chain cuprates Sr2 CuO3 [150,340] and SrCuO2 [245,246], organic conductors such
as the Bechgaard salts [69, 386] or TTF-TCNQ [85] and π -conjugated polymers [35, 135]
like polydiacetylene. However, in all these cases the appropriate electronic Hamiltonians
differ signiﬁcantly from a simple one-band Hubbard model. In the chain cuprates several
bands of electrons need to be taken into account whereas organic conductors and polymers
often have a tendency towards dimerization. Furthermore, it is usually not a good approximation to replace the Coulomb repulsion by a simple on-site Hubbard interaction. Nevertheless
it is perhaps only a question of time until a material is discovered, which at least in some
regime of temperatures and energies can be described in terms of a one-band Hubbard
model.

1.3 External ﬁelds
In the presence of an external electro-magnetic ﬁeld the Hubbard Hamiltonian has to be
modiﬁed. Below we derive the modiﬁcations required in case of the one-band Hubbard
model in the tight-binding approximation. By considering the reaction to a small external
ﬁeld we can also obtain a formula for the zero-temperature conductivity of the periodic
Hubbard chain. This is presented in appendix 1.A.1.

1.3.1 External ﬁelds in three dimensions
Our starting point is electrons on a three-dimensional lattice. An external, time-dependent
electro-magnetic ﬁeld modiﬁes the individual particle momenta and therefore affects only
the one-particle part h 1 (1.5) of the Hamiltonian,

Here Aα , α = x, y, z denote the components of the vector potential of the external ﬁeld,
is its scalar potential, B = rot A is the magnetic ﬁeld, µ B the Bohr magneton and S
the spin operator. The magnetic ﬁeld term in (1.18) acts only on the spin part of the wave
function and therefore can be treated separately. In order to keep the following discussion
simple we disregard it for the time being and restore it in the end. We are free to choose the

Let c j,a , c j,a be creation and annihilation operators of electrons in Wannier states φ(x − R j ).
We suppress the band index from the very beginning, since we are interested only in the
one-band model. The modiﬁed one-particle Hamiltonian (1.18) leads to modiﬁed hopping

into the redeﬁnition (1.22) of the Wannier functions.
Let us now assume that the Wannier functions φ(x − R j ) are strongly localized around R j
and that the vector potential Aα is slowly varying on an atomic scale. Then the approximation
φ̃(x − R j ) = eieλ(R j ,t)/c φ(x − R j )

(1.24)

is justiﬁed. Furthermore, the tight-binding approximation will be valid, and we may retain
only hopping matrix elements between neighbouring lattice sites. As a result we arrive at
the following modiﬁcation of the Hamiltonian (1.17),

The phases in the ﬁrst term on the right are called Peierls phases. Here we wrote t0 instead of t for the hopping matrix element between neighbouring lattice sites in order to
distinguish it from the time variable. We note that in equation (1.25) we have discarded the
coupling of the electron spins to the magnetic ﬁeld B = rot A. It may be added at any later
stage.

In the appendix we shall consider the response to a spatially homogeneous electric ﬁeld.
For our one-dimensional periodic system this means that the electric ﬁeld is of the form

point x from the axis perpendicular to the ring plane through the centre of the ring, say, the

Introduction

We note that the electric ﬁeld is accompanied by a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
B = rot A = Bez perpendicular to the ring plane. This ﬁeld couples to the electron spins
through a term −2µ B B S z , which should be added to the Hamiltonian (1.26).

1.4 Conclusions
In this introduction we have tried to motivate the main object of this book which is the
one-dimensional version of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (1.17). We further showed how the
Hamiltonian is modiﬁed in the presence of an external electro-magnetic ﬁeld (see (1.26)),
and we gave a short review of its history as far as we understand it.

Appendices to Chapter 1

1.A Response to external ﬁelds
As an important example of the response of the Hubbard model to an external perturbation
we show in this appendix how an electro-magnetic ﬁeld induces a current into the onedimensional Hubbard model in the ring geometry of section (1.3). By consistently linearizing
in the amplitude of the applied ﬁeld and using the Born approximation for the time evolution
operator in the interaction picture we obtain a linear relation between applied ﬁeld and
induced current. The Fourier transform of the kernel of the linear operator connecting ﬁeld
and current is the AC conductivity σ (ω).
In Chapter 10 we shall also consider the linear response to other types of perturbations.
The general scheme of expressing measurable quantities like transport coefﬁcients through
correlation functions will always be similar to the example below. For further reading we
recommend standard text books on many-body solid-state theory like e.g. [315].

(1.A.6)

We are interested in the response of the Hubbard model to a small electric ﬁeld. Thus,
we shall assume that λ is a small quantity, and the effect of a small electric ﬁeld is properly
taken into account by retaining only the linear terms in the expansion of the Hamiltonian
(1.26) and the current operator (1.A.4) in λ. We obtain
J (t) = J − λ(t)H0 ,

(1.A.7)

H (t) = H + λ(t)J ,

(1.A.8)

where J and H are the current operator (1.A.4) and the Hamiltonian (1.26) in zero external
ﬁeld λ(t) = 0, respectively, and H0 is the Hubbard Hamiltonian for vanishing interaction
U = 0 which later will be called the ‘tight-binding Hamiltonian’ (see equation (2.12)).

1.A.2 Linear response
In order to obtain an expression for the conductivity, we shall calculate the expectation
value of the current J (t) in a state, which develops from the ground state |ψ0 of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian H under the inﬂuence of the small perturbation λ(t). We calculate
this expectation value in ﬁrst order time dependent perturbation theory and to linear order
in λ(t). To make sure that the system evolves from the ground state of the unperturbed
Hamiltonian we have to require the perturbation to be switched off for t → −∞,
lim λ(t) = 0 .

t→−∞

(1.A.9)

The time evolution operator U of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H is the solution of the
initial value problem
i∂t U = HU ,

lim U (t) = id ,

t→−∞

The electric current is conventionally normalized to a 3d unit volume, even in 1d systems.

Then for |ψ a solution of the Schrödinger equation i∂t |ψ = H (t)|ψ we ﬁnd
i∂t |ψt = λ(t)Jt |ψt .

(1.A.13)

Here we have used (1.A.8) and (1.A.10). The time evolution operator Û corresponding to
the reduced Schrödinger equation (1.A.13) is determined by the initial value problem
i∂t Û = λ(t)Jt Û ,

lim Û (t) = id ,

(1.A.14)

which may equivalently be written as an integral equation,

Û (t) = id − i

The latter result will be sufﬁcient for our purpose of calculating the linear response of the
Hubbard model to a small perturbation.
First note that by (1.A.10), (1.A.12) and (1.A.14) the product U Û is the time evolution
operator of the time dependent Hamiltonian (1.A.8),
i∂t U Û = (H + λ(t)J )U Û ,

lim U (t)Û (t) = id .

(1.A.17)

It follows for a state |ψ(t) , evolving from the ground state |ψ0 of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, that

The Hubbard Hamiltonian and its symmetries

The Hubbard model is a model of itinerant, interacting electrons on a lattice. The structure
and the dimension of the lattice inﬂuence its features. This book deals with the special case
when the lattice is one-dimensional, since only then an exact solution is known. Only in
one dimension we have the rare opportunity to get a deep and rigorous insight into the rich
structure of an interacting many-body system.
In this chapter we work out the basic properties of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We try
to do this rather explicitly and in an elementary way that requires no preknowledge of
solid state physics. Although we restrict ourselves from the very beginning to the onedimensional model, the results presented here readily generalize to (bipartite) lattices of
arbitrary dimension. The peculiarities of the one-dimensional model will be explored in the
remaining part of the book.

2.1 The Hamiltonian
As with many other models in physics the term ‘Hubbard model’ is used somewhat freely in
the literature. Many variants and generalizations of Hubbard’s original Hamiltonian (1.17)
have been considered over the years. In what follows, however, we shall be rather speciﬁc:
by ‘Hubbard model’ we shall mean the one-dimensional one-band electronic model with
nearest-neighbour hopping deﬁned by the Hamiltonian [298]

U and t are real numbers, which set the energy scale and ﬁx the relative strength of
the two sums that contribute to the Hamiltonian. We impose periodic boundary conditions on the operators, c L+1,a = c1,a . Due to this deﬁnition the Hamiltonian is invariant under cyclic permutations of the lattice sites, or, equivalently, under lattice translations on a ring of L sites. Different kinds of boundary conditions are discussed below in
Chapter 8.3.

a = ↑, ↓ .

(2.3)

Let us introduce row vectors of electron and spin coordinates, x = (x1 , . . . , x N ) and a =
(a1 , . . . , a N ) with x j ∈ {1, . . . , L} and a j =↑, ↓. The space of states of the Hubbard model
is spanned by all linear combinations of the so-called Wannier states
|x, a = cx† N ,a N . . . cx†1 ,a1 |0 .

(2.4)

We fancy these states as states where electrons of spin a j are located in atomic orbitals at
lattice sites x j , j = 1, . . . , N . We say the sites x j are occupied by electrons.
The number of linearly independent Wannier states is necessarily ﬁnite, since according
to (2.2a), creation operators at different sites or with different spin indices anticommute,
†
and (c j,a )2 = 0. A basis B of the space of states is obtained by ordering the Fermi operators
in (2.4). We may choose for instance
B = |x, a ∈ H(L)

N = 0, . . . , 2L
x j+1 ≥ x j , a j+1 > a j if x j+1 = x j

(2.5)

where by convention ↑<↓, and N = 0 corresponds to the vacuum state |0 . The basis B is
called the Wannier basis.
The number of all linearly

by one electron with spin up or down, or a doubly occupied site, respectively. Since (c j,a )2 =
0, electrons of the same spin cannot occupy the same lattice site. This is the Pauli principle
which is built-in into the deﬁnition of the Fermi operators.
†
The operator n j,a = c j,a c j,a is the local particle number operator for electrons of spin
a at site j. Let us recall why this name is justiﬁed. Due to (2.2) and (2.3) it follows

A ﬁrst interpretation of the Hubbard model can be obtained by considering separately
the two contributions that make up the Hamiltonian (2.1). For t = 0 or U = 0 it can be
diagonalized and understood by elementary means. For t = 0 the Hamiltonian reduces to
H = UD, where

Here we used δ↑,ak δ↓,ak = 0 in the second equation and the Pauli principle in the third
equation. As we learn from (2.11) every state |x, a is an eigenstate of the operator D. Thus,
D is diagonal in the Wannier basis. The limit t → 0 of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.1) is
called the atomic limit, because the eigenstate |x, a describes electrons localized at the
sites x1 , . . . , x N , which are identiﬁed with the loci of the atomic orbitals the electrons may
occupy.
The meaning of the operator D is evident from equation (2.11). D counts the number of
doubly occupied sites in the state |x, a . The contribution of the term UD to the energy is
non-negative for positive U and increases with the number of doubly occupied sites. This
can be viewed as on-site repulsion among the electrons. Negative U on the other hand,
means on-site attraction. Hence, it is natural to refer to D as to the operator of the on-site
interaction.
In the other extreme, when U = 0, the Hamiltonian (2.1) turns into

The Hubbard Hamiltonian and its symmetries

Thus, the tight-binding Hamiltonian H0 is diagonal in the Bloch basis. It describes noninteracting band electrons in a cosine-shaped band of width 4t.
The tight-binding Hamiltonian H0 and the operator D which counts the number of doubly
occupied sites do not commute. Therefore the Hubbard Hamiltonian can neither be diagonal
in the Bloch basis nor in the Wannier basis. The construction of its eigenstates for general
t and U will be the subject of the next chapter. The physics of the Hubbard model may be
understood as arising from the competition between the two contributions, H0 and D, to
the Hamiltonian (2.1). The tight-binding contribution H0 prefers to delocalize the electrons,
while the on-site interaction D favours localization. The ratio
U
u=
(2.21)
4t
is a measure for the relative contribution of both terms and is the intrinsic, dimensionless
coupling constant of the Hubbard model.
For the purpose of this book it is natural to measure energies in units of t. This is equivalent
to setting t = 1. Then the Hamiltonian (2.1) turns into

†

[ N̂a , c j,b ck,b ] = [ N̂a , c j,b ]ck,b + c j,b [ N̂a , ck,b ] = 0 .

(2.29)

[H, N̂a ] = 0 ,

a = ↑, ↓ .

(2.30)

The numbers of up- and down-spin electrons are separately conserved. Now N̂ = N̂↑ + N̂↓ ,
S z = 12 ( N̂↑ − N̂↓ ), and we obtain (2.26).
We shall denote the conserved number of down-spin electrons by M and the conserved
total number of electrons by N . The value of the z-component of the total spin for a state
with M down-spin electrons is N /2 − M. In Chapter 3 we shall diagonalize H for ﬁxed
values of M and N .
Because of the particle number conservation, we may add a term −2u N̂ + u L to the

2.2 Symmetries
The one-dimensional Hubbard model has many symmetries. Some of them, like the translational symmetry or the symmetry under spin ﬂips, are obvious and common. Apart from
the obvious symmetries, however, there are others which are rather unusual.
We distinguish symmetries which are independent of the coupling constant u, from symmetries which, on the contrary, depend on u. The existence of the latter type of symmetries
relates to the fact that the one-dimensional Hubbard model is exactly solvable. This symmetry type includes an Abelian symmetry generated by a series of mutually commuting
higher conserved operators and the non-Abelian so-called Yangian symmetry (see Chapters
12 and 14).
Here we concentrate on the u-independent symmetries. In the context of the onedimensional Hubbard model they were systematically studied by Heilmann and Lieb [197]
as early as 1971. Later, in a period of renewed interest in the Hubbard model it was observed [361, 494, 497] that much of the analysis of Heilmann and Lieb carries over to an
arbitrary dimension of the lattice. The symmetries considered by Heilmann and Lieb are of
three kinds: spatial symmetries related to the lattice, symmetries connected to the spin and
symmetries associated with special features of the Hubbard model.

26

The Hubbard Hamiltonian and its symmetries

2.2.1 Permutations
Since the Hubbard model is deﬁned on a lattice, the set of all possible spatial transformations
is equal to the set of all permutations of site indices. These permutations form the symmetric
group S L . Our ﬁrst goal is therefore to construct a faithful representation of the symmetric
group in terms of Fermi operators. For this purpose it is sufﬁcient to construct representations
of the elementary transpositions, which generate the symmetric group.
†
†
†
Let us start with spinless fermions, {c j , ck } = {c j , ck } = 0, {c j , ck } = δ jk , on a onedimensional lattice of L sites. Let
†

†

Pi j = 1 − (ci − c j )(ci − c j ) .

(2.32)

It is not difﬁcult to see that Pi j permutes fermions. We have the obvious identities
†

Pi j = Pi j ,

Pi j = P ji .

(2.33)

Use of the fundamental anticommutators for the fermions leads to
†

†

†

†

Pi j ci = ci + (ci − c j )c j (ci − c j ) = ci + (−1 + c j c j − c j ci )(ci − c j ) = c j Pi j .

(2.34)

It then follows from (2.33) that
Pi j c j = ci Pi j ,

†

†

Pi j ci = c j Pi j ,

†

†

Pi j c j = ci Pi j .

(2.35)

Thus, the operators Pi j induce the action of transpositions on the site indices of the Fermi
operators.
Let us show that the Pi j generate a representation of the symmetric group. First of all,
we obtain from (2.34) and (2.35) that
Pi j P jk = Pik Pi j = P jk Pik ,

i = j = k = i .

(2.36)

A short calculation similar to the one in equation (2.34) shows that
Pi j Pi j = 1 .

(2.37)

[Pi j , Pkl ] = 0

(2.38)

Finally, we have the obvious identity

for i, j = k, l. The relations (2.36)–(2.38) are a possible choice of deﬁning relations for the
symmetric group.
Formally, the site indices i, j, k in the preceding calculations are just labels. We may
replace them by more complicated labels without spoiling the validity of our results. The
replacement j → ja, where j is a site index and a = ↑, ↓ is a spin index leads to
†

†

Pia, jb = 1 − (ci,a − c j,b )(ci,a − c j,b ) .

(2.39)

These transposition operators were introduced by Heilmann and Lieb [197] in their analysis
of the symmetries of the Hubbard model.1 They describe simultaneous transpositions of site
and spin indices, or, in more physical terms, they interchange electrons in Wannier orbitals.
1

Unfortunately, there is a typo in their deﬁnition, equation (8) of their paper.

2.2 Symmetries

27

2.2.2 Spatial symmetries
We may imagine the L Wannier orbitals of the one-dimensional Hubbard model as forming
a regular polygon with L edges and corners. The spatial symmetries of the Hubbard model
are then the symmetries of this polygon. They are generated by a rotation through 2π/L and
by an arbitrary reﬂection which maps the polygon onto itself. The corresponding symmetry
operators are the shift operator and the parity operator.
The shift operator is a representation of the generator of the cyclic subgroup of order L
of the symmetric group [197]. For spinless fermions we deﬁne
Ûn = Pn−1n . . . P23 P12 ,

n = 2, . . . , L .

Using equation (2.34) we can readily verify that

c j−1 Û L
, if
Û L c j =
c L Û L

j = 2, . . . , L
j = 1.

(2.40)

(2.41)

This means that Û L is acting as a left shift operator on the elementary Fermi operators.
Now, (2.40) implies that
†

Û L = P12 . . . PL−1L .

(2.42)
†

†

†

It follows from equation (2.37) that Û L is unitary, Û L Û L = Û L Û L = 1. The operator Û L
generates a shift to the right by one lattice site.
To realize the shift operator for electrons, we have to attach a spin label to the above
operators. We deﬁne shift operators U L↑ and U L↓ for up- and down-spin electrons by
replacing P j, j+1 in equation (2.40) with P j↑, j+1↑ and P j↓, j+1↓ , respectively. We observe
that [Û L↑ , c j↓ ] = [Û L↓ , c j↑ ] = 0. Thus,
Û = Û L↑ Û L↓

(2.43)

is the left shift operator for electrons.
Using the deﬁnition (2.13) of c̃k,a we obtain
†

†

Û c̃k,a = eiφk c̃k,a Û .

(2.44)

It follows that Û acts diagonally on the basis B of Bloch states, equation (2.19),
Û |q, a = eiφ(k1 +···+k N ) |q, a .

(2.45)

Obviously, the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) is invariant under a change of site indices
of the Fermi operators from j to L − j + 1. The corresponding parity operator R L can be
conveniently expressed in terms of the operators Ûn , equation (2.40), as the ordered product
R L = Û2 . . . Û L .

(2.46)

Equivalently, R L may be written as
RL =

[L/2]

j=1

P j,L− j+1 ,

(2.47)

28

The Hubbard Hamiltonian and its symmetries

where [L/2] denotes the integer part of L/2, which is L/2 for even L and (L − 1)/2 for
odd L. From the form (2.47) of the parity operator and from (2.37) it is clear that R L2 = id
†
and R L = R L . Thus, R L is unitary and Hermitian. We may again deﬁne a parity operator
for electrons R = R L↑ R L↓ after attaching spin labels ↑ and ↓ to the operators in (2.47).

2.2.3 The momentum operator
Observables in quantum mechanics are described by Hermitian operators. For this reason we
would like to deﬁne a Hermitian momentum operator that generates the shifts on the lattice.
Generically, the momentum operator is deﬁned as the generator of inﬁnitesimal spatial
shifts. This deﬁnition, however, does not work on a lattice. Alternatively, following [178],
ˆ by the following three requirements.
we may try to deﬁne a lattice momentum operator 

does not satisfy (2.48c). It is not a conserved quantity for the Hubbard model. A way out
of this dilemma comes from the fact that the condition (2.48a) ﬁxes the momentum only
modulo 2π.

of Û and the fact that Û L = 1. (2.48c) is satisﬁed, because the Hubbard Hamiltonian
commutes with Û .

2.2.4 More discrete symmetries
We would like to consider two more discrete transformations: the spin ﬂip and the so-called
Shiba transformation. Both are useful to restrict the ranges of N and M, the numbers of
electrons and down spins, and will be utilized in the next chapter, where we diagonalize the one-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian. Moreover, the invariance of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian, modulo sign of the coupling, under the Shiba transformations is the reason
for the appearance of a second su(2) symmetry besides the more or less obvious rotational
symmetry.

30

The Hubbard Hamiltonian and its symmetries

The Hubbard Hamiltonian is invariant under the reversal of all spins, caused by a similarity
transformation with the operator
J

(s)

=

L


P j↑, j↓ .

(2.57)

j=1

This transformation maps the eigenstates with M down-spin electrons and N − M up-spin
electrons one-to-one onto the eigenstates with M up-spin electrons and N − M down-spin
electrons. Thus, the z-component of the total spin changes its sign. As a consequence we may
restrict ourselves to non-negative values N /2 − M of S z , when we diagonalize the Hubbard
Hamiltonian in Chapter 3. It is clear from the deﬁnition of the transposition operators (2.39)
that the transformation (2.57) leaves the empty lattice state |0 invariant.
Let us now consider a lattice with an even number of sites. We deﬁne the operators
†

†

†

†

Ja(sh) = (c L ,a − c L ,a )(c L−1,a + c L−1,a ) . . . (c2,a − c2,a )(c1,a + c1,a ) ,

(2.58)

a = ↑, ↓. Note that the signs in the bracket on the right hand side alternate and are plus for
odd lattice sites and minus for even lattice sites. The operators (2.58) generate a particlehole transformation on spin species a, accompanied by a change of sign on every second
lattice site. We obtain, for instance, [J↓(sh) , c j,↑ ] = 0 and

†
†
J↓(sh) c j,↓ J↓(sh) = (−1) j c j,↓ .

(2.59)

Clearly, for an even number of lattice sites, the tight-binding part of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) is invariant under the transformations generated by Ja(sh) , a = ↑, ↓, while the
interaction part changes its sign. Thus, H (u) is mapped to H (−u). The empty lattice is
mapped to
†

†

Ja(sh) |0 = c L ,a . . . c1,a |0 ,

(2.60)

which is the fully spin polarized half-ﬁlled band state.
The transformation (2.59) is often called the Shiba transformation but was probably ﬁrst
obtained in [197, 298]. Of course, it is possible to deﬁne the Shiba transformation for an
odd number of lattice sites. In that case, however, the tight-binding part of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian (2.31) is not invariant under the Shiba transformation anymore. Due to the
periodic boundary conditions the two odd lattice sites 1 and L are nearest neighbours, and
†
†
the terms c1 c L and c L c1 pick up a minus sign. This may be avoided by switching to open
boundaries. A Hubbard Hamiltonian invariant under a Shiba transformation can always be
deﬁned on a bipartite lattice with appropriate boundary conditions. A bipartite lattice is a
union of two complementary sublattices 1 and 2 , where each lattice site in 1 has nearest
neighbours only in 2 and vice versa.
For a lattice with an even number of sites let us perform Shiba transformations for the upand for the down spins. Then the Hamiltonian is not altered, since the sign of the coupling
is switched twice, but the empty lattice state is mapped onto a state with all sites doubly
occupied. Thus, all eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) with N electrons are

2.2 Symmetries

31

mapped onto eigenstates with 2L − N electrons, and we may restrict ourselves to N ≤ L,
when we diagonalize the Hubbard Hamiltonian in Chapter 3.
The spin ﬂip and the Shiba transformations affect the particle number operator and the
operator of the z-component of the total spin in a non-trivial way,

H , N̂ and S z and the invariance of the trace of a product of matrices under cyclic permutations
of the matrices we conclude with (2.61) that
f (µ, B, T, u) = f (µ, −B, T, u)

(2.63b)

and (2.61c).

2.2.5 SO(4) symmetry
We saw in Section 2.1 that the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) conserves the z-component S z
of the total spin and the particle number N̂ . Both operators generate U(1) transformations.
The operator S z is the generator of rotations about the z-axis, the particle number operator
N̂ generates the global gauge transformations. We shall now deﬁne the operators S x and S y
of the x- and y-components of the total spin. S x , S y and S z combine into a representation

32

The Hubbard Hamiltonian and its symmetries

of the Lie algebra su(2) which generates the group SU(2) of rotations in spin space. We
shall show that the Hubbard Hamiltonian commutes with S x , S y and S z and thus is fully
rotationally invariant. For an even number of lattice sites, we shall see that the particle
number is part of another, hidden su(2) symmetry which has its origin in the invariance
modulo sign of the coupling of the Hubbard Hamiltonian under the Shiba transformation
(2.59). This non-Abelian extension of the gauge symmetry is called the η-pairing symmetry.
We deﬁne the operators of the components of the total spin as

where εαβγ is the totally antisymmetric tensor. As was claimed above the spin operators
generate a representation of su(2),
[S α , S β ] = iεαβγ S γ ,

α, β = x, y, z ,

(2.69)

and commute with the Hubbard Hamiltonian,
[H, S α ] = 0 ,

α = x, y, z .

(2.70)

It is not difﬁcult to verify (2.69) and (2.70). One has to use the fundamental anticommutation relations (2.2) in the calculation of various commutators. As a convenient means
to deal with all of these commutators simultaneously we introduce so-called current operators [172]. We ﬁrst of all deﬁne a 2 × 2 operator valued matrix S jk with matrix elements
†

S jk ab = c j,a ck,b

(2.71)

for a, b = 1, 2. Using the fundamental anticommutation relations (2.2) we obtain the commutators
[S jk ab , Slm dc ] = δkl δcb S jm ad − δm j δad Slk bc .

(2.72)

We further introduce the projections of S jk onto a gl(2) basis consisting of the Pauli matrices
and the 2 × 2 unit matrix I2 ,
S αjk = tr(σ α S jk ) ,

S 0jk = tr(S jk ) .

(2.73)

Equation (2.74a) is obtained by setting a = b and c = d in (2.72) and summing over a and
c. For (2.74b) we ﬁrst multiply (2.72) by a Pauli matrix and then take the traces. Similarly,
to obtain (2.74c) we have to multiply by two Pauli matrices and have to use the identity

relations
[η z , η± ] = ±η± ,

[η+ , η− ] = 2η z

(2.81)

for the η-pairing operators. Let us deﬁne the analogues of S x and S y ,
η x = 12 (η+ + η− ) ,

η y = − 2i (η+ − η− ) ,

(2.82)

which due to (2.81) satisfy
[ηα , ηβ ] = iε αβγ ηγ ,

α, β = x, y, z .

(2.83)

The invariance of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) under the η-pairing symmetry follows
from [H (−u), S α ] = 0 by application of the Shiba transformation,
[H, ηα ] = 0 ,

α = x, y, z .

(2.84)

A trivial yet important implication of (2.70) and (2.84) that will be useful later on is that the
Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) also commutes with the Casimir operators (S α )2 and (ηα )2 .
To get a full understanding of the symmetries of the Hubbard Hamiltonian we still have
to consider the mutual commutators of the two sets of generators S α and ηβ . We claim that
[S α , ηβ ] = 0 ,

α, β = x, y, z .

(2.85)

Because of the antisymmetry, this is a set of six independent equations to be veriﬁed. We may,

†
†
†
†
for instance, start with c j,↑ c j,↓ ck,↓ ck,↑ = ck,↓ ck,↑ c j,↑ c j,↓ , which implies that [S + , η+ ] = 0.
Reversing all spins we obtain [S − , η+ ] = 0. Then, because of (2.79), also [S z , η+ ] = 0.
Hence, η+ is invariant under rotations. But η− is the Hermitian conjugate of η+ , so it is
invariant under rotations as well. Finally, because of (2.81), the same is true for η z , and we
have proved (2.85).
So far we have shown that the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) commutes with the direct
sum of two representations of su(2). We have to keep in mind that the invariance under the
η-pairing symmetry, equation (2.84), holds only for an even number of lattice sites L. This
fact imposes restrictions on joint irreducible representations of spin and η-spin realized on

2.3 Conclusions

35

eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. From the deﬁnitions (2.25), (2.27) and (2.80c) we
obtain
S z + η z = N̂↑ − L/2 .

(2.86)

Thus, S z + η z when acting on a joint highest weight state takes only integer eigenvalues
(see Section 3.4). Spin and η-spin are either both integer or both half odd integer.
It follows from (2.80c) and (2.81) that η+ and η− do not preserve the number of particles,
[ N̂ , η± ] = ±2η± .

(2.87)

The operator η+ creates a so-called η-pair in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. η− is the corresponding annihilation operator. As an immediate consequence of the deﬁnitions (2.80a),
(2.80b) we obtain
{Û , η± } = 0 .

(2.88)

Thus, η-pairs have lattice momentum π .
The full SO(4) ∼
= SU(2) × SU(2)/Z2 symmetry is only realized for the Hubbard Hamiltonian of the form (2.31). Adding a magnetic ﬁeld term −2 BSz breaks the rotational invariance, while the η-pairing invariance is preserved. Adding a chemical potential term
−µ N̂ , on the other hand, breaks the η-pairing symmetry, but preserves the invariance under
rotations. The chemical potential µ plays the same role of a symmetry breaking ﬁeld for
the η-spin as the magnetic ﬁeld B for the spin.

2.3 Conclusions
In this introductory chapter we gave a thorough description of the one-dimensional Hubbard
model and considered its basic properties and symmetries. The features of the Hubbard
model as far as considered here are not peculiar to the one-dimensional model. They readily
generalize to higher dimensional bipartite lattices.
Appendix 2.A is devoted to the strong coupling limit of the Hubbard model, which gives
rise to a number of other prominent models in solid state theory, like the isotropic Heisenberg
model or the t-J model. In appendix 2.B we consider several possible continuum limits
of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. The reader who is less interested in or already familiar with
the limiting cases of the Hubbard model may skip the appendices and proceed directly to
Chapter 3.

(2.A.2)

On the right hand side of the ﬁrst equation (2.A.2) implicit summation over a = ↑, ↓
is understood. We shall assume that t j j = 0, tk j = t ∗jk and U > 0. The discussion of the
attractive case, U < 0, is very similar and is left as an exercise to the reader. The Hamiltonian
(2.A.1) is a slight generalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.1). It turns into (2.1) for
an appropriate choice of the hopping matrix elements t jk .
Let us assume that |t jk |  U for j, k = 1, . . . , L. Then T can be considered as a small
perturbation to U D. As we have seen in Section 2.1 the operator D acts diagonally on the
basis B of Wannier states. It counts the number of doubly occupied states. Its eigenvalues are
thus n = 0, 1, . . . , L. Let us denote the projectors onto the corresponding eigenspaces Hn by
Pn . The Hilbert space H(L) of our model (2.A.1) decomposes into H(L) = H0 ⊕ · · · ⊕ H L ,
and D has the spectral decomposition
D=

The Hamiltonian (2.A.1) conserves the number of electrons N . In the following we will
be interested in the case when N ≤ L. In this case the space of N -particle eigenstates has
non-zero overlap with the eigenspace H0 of P0 , which is spanned by the degenerate ground
 
states of D. The number of these ground states for a ﬁxed number of electrons N is 2 N NL .
Hence, the total number of Wannier states with no site doubly occupied is
dim H0 = 3 L .

(2.A.4)

The perturbation T will partially lift this large degeneracy. The lowest energy level of UD

2.A The strong coupling limit

37

will split into many levels, which are expected, however, to be well separated from the ﬁrst
excited level of UD as long as the condition |t jk |  U holds. The splitting of the ground state
of UD (in second order perturbation theory) will be described by an effective Hamiltonian,
the so-called t-J -Hamiltonian, whose derivation is the subject of the following subsections.
The t-J -Hamiltonian is the most general effective strong coupling approximation to the
Hamiltonian (2.A.1). Upon further restriction of the parameters it generates a number of
prominent models in solid state theory. At half-ﬁlling (N = L) it turns into the Hamiltonian
of the isotropic spin- 12 Heisenberg chain. The restriction to ﬁrst order perturbation theory
leads to the so-called t-0 model. Keeping only the two-site terms another important variant
of the t-J model is obtained.
Our approach here is quite standard and has earlier been described in other textbooks
(see e.g. [27,152]). For further reading we recommend Takahashi’s article [437], where the
strong coupling perturbation theory for the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model has been carried out
to higher orders and where references to the older literature can be found.

2.A.1 Projectors
As an input for the perturbative treatment of H we will need expressions for the projectors
Pn in terms of fermions. A fermionic representation of the projector Pn can be obtained
from the generating function

2.A.2 Second order perturbation theory around an energy level
Consider any Hamiltonian H acting on a Hilbert space H. Let P be a projection
on a subspace PH of H and Q = 1 − P. |ψ is a solution of the Schrödinger
equation
H |ψ = E|ψ

(2.A.10)

PHP|ψ + PHQ|ψ = EP|ψ ,

(2.A.11a)

QHP|ψ + QHQ|ψ = EQ|ψ .

(2.A.11b)

with eigenvalue E, if and only if

Let us solve equation (2.A.11b) for Q|ψ and insert the result into (2.A.11a). We obtain
Ĥ (E)|ϕ = E|ϕ ,

(2.A.12)

Ĥ (E) = PH (1 + (E − QH )−1 QH )P

(2.A.13)

where

and |ϕ = P|ψ . Thus, |ϕ ∈ PH is a solution of the spectral problem (2.A.12) with eigenvalue E. Conversely, if |ϕ ∈ PH solves (2.A.12), the vector
|ψ = (1 + (E − QH )−1 QH )|ϕ

(2.A.14)

is a solution of the full stationary Schrödinger equation (2.A.10) with eigenvalue E.
Remark. We have assumed the spectra of H and Q H be disjoint. This should be true
for generic choice of P. Then, by construction, equation (2.A.12) contains the complete
information about the spectrum of H and all eigenstates of H follow from (2.A.14). Since
Ĥ (E) is nonlinear in E, there may be several eigenvalues belonging to the same eigenvector
|ϕ . In the extreme case a single eigenvector of Ĥ (E) determines the complete spectrum of
H . The reader may verify this statement with the toy example

Equations (2.A.12) and (2.A.13) are a convenient starting point for the perturbation theory

and a perturbation H1 coupled to H0 by a coupling constant λ.

2.A The strong coupling limit

39

Replacing P by Pn in (2.A.13) we obtain
Ĥn (E) = Pn H (1 + (E − Q n H )−1 Q n H )Pn .

(2.A.18)

This operator acts non-trivially only on the degeneracy subspace corresponding to the
nth energy level E n of H0 . Nevertheless, it determines the complete spectrum and all
eigenfunctions of H through (2.A.12) and (2.A.14). We may use the explicit form (2.A.17)
of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 to express Ĥn (E) entirely in terms of the projectors Pn ,
the unperturbed energy levels E n and the perturbation H1 . A short calculation based on the
elementary relations

So far we have achieved nothing but a reformulation of our original spectral problem
(2.A.10). Now perturbation theory around the energy level E n is the iterative solution of
equation (2.A.21) in ascending orders of λ. For λ = 0 the left hand side of (2.A.21) vanishes
and we have E = E n . For small λ we expect corrections to E n of the form
E = E n + λE n(1) + λ2 E n(2) + O(λ3 ) .

(2.A.22)

On the left hand side of equation (2.A.21) these corrections do not contribute to the ﬁrst
and second order terms in an expansion in λ. Thus, for the part of the spectrum of H , which
evolves from the energy level E n as the coupling λ is turned on, we obtain to quadratic
order in λ the linear spectral problem

2.A.3 The Hubbard model in the strong coupling limit
Let us now apply the formalism of the previous section to the Hamiltonian (2.A.1). We
rescale the Hamiltonian as
H/U = D + T /U .

(2.A.25)

Then, the energy has to be rescaled as well. H/U is of the form (2.A.16) with H0 = D,
H1 = T and λ = 1/U . Hence, (2.A.23) applies for large U .
The operator D has eigenvalues E n = n, for n = 0, 1, . . . , L. Setting n = 0 in (2.A.23)
and inserting the above data we obtain

The operator on the left hand side is often called the t-J -Hamiltonian. We will denote
it by Ht−J . It describes the splitting of the lowest energy level E 0 = 0 of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian in the atomic limit, in the situation, when the hopping amplitudes are small
compared to the Hubbard interaction U . The projection operators Pm , m = 0, . . . , L, are
given by equation (2.A.9). In particular,
P0 =

is the projection operator onto the space with no doubly occupied site.
The work that remains to be done is to express the t-J -Hamiltonian in a more convenient
and intuitively understandable form. First note the relation
n j,↑ n j,↓ P0 = P0 n j,↑ n j,↓ = 0

(2.A.28)

for j = 1, . . . , L, which implies that

The second sum in this expression can be further simpliﬁed. Let us concentrate for a moment
†
on the sum over k  . For k  = j, k the term n k  ,↑ n k  ,↓ can be commuted through c j,a ck,a , and,
by (2.A.28), the corresponding terms in the second sum in (2.A.31) vanish. The term with
†
k  = j also vanishes. For j = k this follows from c j,a n j,↑ n j,↓ = 0 and for j = k from
†

c j,a c j,a n j,↑ n j,↓ = 2n j,↑ n j,↓ and again (2.A.28). Thus, the only non-vanishing contribution
in the sum over k  comes from the term k  = k, and the second sum in (2.A.31) reduces
to a triple sum over j, k, and l. Finally, in the remaining triple sum, we may commute the
term n k,↑ n k,↓ to the left and use once more equation (2.A.28). The resulting expression for
the t-J -Hamiltonian is most conveniently expressed in terms of the operators S αjk and S 0jk
introduced in equation (2.73),

Appendices to Chapter 2

Here we left out the operator P0 on the very right, which is justiﬁed, since Ht−J acts on the
projected space P0 H(L) .
It is easy to verify that the t-J -Hamiltonian conserves the number of particles and the
total spin,
[Ht−J , N̂ ] = [Ht−J , S α ] = 0

(2.A.35)

for α = x, y, z.
Let us summarize our results. Using a kind of second order perturbation theory, which
includes projection onto the restricted Hilbert space H0 = P0 H(L) , we obtained an effective
strong coupling approximation to the Hamiltonian (2.A.1). We presented this so-called
t-J -Hamiltonian in three different forms (2.A.32)-(2.A.34). Note that our derivation did
not rely on the one-dimensionality of the Hamiltonian (2.A.1). Results similar to (2.A.32)–
(2.A.34) hold in arbitrary dimensions. In order to obtain the low lying eigenstates of the full
Hamiltonian in second order perturbation theory one has to apply the operator (2.A.24) to the
eigenstates of the t-J -Hamiltonian. In contrast to the eigenstates of the t-J -Hamiltonian
the eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian in second order perturbation theory have a small
probability of having doubly occupied sites.
Usually the t-J -Hamiltonian as presented in, say, (2.A.34) is not directly studied in the
literature. It rather is considered in certain more specialized situations that will be discussed
below.

2.A.4 Heisenberg spin chain and Mott transition
Ht−J conserves the number of electrons (see (2.A.35)). At half-ﬁlling, when the number
of electrons N equals the number of lattice sites L, all eigenstates of Ht−J must be ‘pure

spin states’ of the form |a1 , . . . , a L = c L ,a L . . . c1,a1 |0 . In these states every lattice site is
occupied precisely by one electron. Then (1 − n j )|a1 , . . . , a L = 0, and the Hamiltonian
(2.A.34) reduces to

hopping t jk = −t(δ j,k−1 + δ j,k+1 ) the Hamiltonian (2.A.1) turns into the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.1). The corresponding spin chain Hamiltonian (2.A.36) becomes

where periodic boundary conditions SL+1

coupling is the same as the sign of the Hubbard interaction U . Thus, we have shown

2.A The strong coupling limit

43

the following remarkable fact: At half-ﬁlling and for strong repulsion U  |t| the lowlying excitations of the Hubbard model are effectively described by the excitations of an
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain.
The spin Hamiltonian (2.A.37) is exactly solvable by Bethe ansatz and is in fact the model
the Bethe ansatz was ﬁrst applied to in Bethe’s original article [60].
If we apply an external electro-magnetic ﬁeld to the Hubbard model it appears as a
complex phase in the hopping matrix elements, t jk → t jk eiλ jk (see Chapter 1.3), and the ﬁrst
and the third sum in (2.A.34) have to be modiﬁed. The second sum, however, containing
merely the modulus |t jk |, remains unchanged. At half-ﬁlling the effective Hamiltonian
is again (2.A.36). This means that to second order strong coupling perturbation theory
the Hubbard Hamiltonian does not couple to an external electro-magnetic ﬁeld. Hence,
its conductivity is zero. On the other hand, the tight-binding model, which is the weak
coupling limit U → 0 of the Hubbard model has a non-vanishing conductivity [159]. This
hints that at a critical interaction Uc there is an interaction induced phase transition from
a conducting phase to an insulating phase. Such kind of phase transition is called a Mott
metal-insulator transition. Later we shall see that the critical coupling strength in case of
the one-dimensional Hubbard model is Uc = 0.
2.A.5 Neglecting the three-site terms
Close to half-ﬁlling the mean values of the ﬁrst and the third sum on the right hand side
of (2.A.34) are still expected to be small. In particular, the third sum may be considered to be unimportant compared to the second sum. On the other hand, the third sum in
(2.A.34) is of higher order in 1/U than the ﬁrst sum. Thus, close to half-ﬁlling the main
features of the Hamiltonian (2.A.34) are expected to be properly described by its simpliﬁed

is most frequently encountered in the literature. Unfortunately, for the

In general, the t-J -Hamiltonian (2.A.39) is not solvable by Bethe ansatz [377]. For the
special values 4t/U = 2 and 4t/U = 0 of the coupling constant, however, Bethe ansatz

solutions exist [377]. At 4t/U = 2 the model has higher global symmetry. The model
becomes invariant under the action of the Lie super algebra gl(1|2). Therefore the t-J (2)
Hamiltonian Ht−J
with 4t/U = 2 is called the supersymmetric t-J -Hamiltonian.
The history of the supersymmetric t-J model as a solvable model is rather involved.
Many authors contributed to its solution. For the reader who is interested in more details we
recommend the article [119], where the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution was obtained and
the role of the gl(1|2) symmetry has been stressed. The article [119] also contains a brief
account of the history of the supersymmetric t-J model with many references to further
original articles.

This model is called the t-0 model or the restricted hopping model. It is also obtained from
(2.A.33) in the case of nearest-neighbour hopping and for U → ∞, i.e., when the strong
coupling perturbation theory, which led to the t-J -Hamiltonian (2.A.33), is restricted to
ﬁrst order.
The t-0 model is interesting because of its extreme simplicity. From the point of view of
its algebraic structure it is closely related to the XX spin chain [179,313]. It has been solved
by the algebraic Bethe ansatz [179] and by coordinate Bethe ansatz [219]. The t-0 model
is an interesting toy model for the study of quantum correlation functions. A determinant
representation (see [270]) for the two-particle Green’s functions was obtained in [219].

2.A.7 An overview over the strong coupling effective models related
to the Hubbard model
We have become acquainted with the various descendants of the Hubbard model in the
strong coupling limit |t|  U . A schematic picture of their interdependencies is given in
ﬁgure 2.A.1.
First of all, the t-J -Hamiltonian Ht−J , which includes three-site terms, is obtained from
the Hubbard Hamiltonian in second order perturbation theory in |t|/U . The Heisenberg spin
chain is the effective Hamiltonian at half-ﬁlling, N /L = 1. Ignoring the three-site terms in
(2)
. We argued that the three-site terms might be
Ht−J , we obtained the t-J -Hamiltonian Ht−J
non-essential at strong coupling and close to half ﬁlling. In ﬁgure 2.A.1 we tried to indicate
the somewhat heuristic nature of our arguments by drawing a dashed arrow between Ht−J
(2)
(2)
and Ht−J
. The t-0-Hamiltonian follows from Ht−J (or Ht−J
) in the limit U → ∞ and
corresponds to ﬁrst order perturbation theory. Finally, we included the supersymmetric t(s)
(2)
J -Hamiltonian Ht−J
into our scheme. It is equal to the t-J -Hamiltonian Ht−J
at a certain

Bethe ansatz.
Let us note that second order perturbation theory is not the only possible starting point for
the derivation of the effective strong coupling Hamiltonian Ht−J . We choose this starting
point here, since it is close to common textbook knowledge and rather universally applicable.
For an alternative derivation of the strong coupling descendants of the Hubbard model, which
uses more of the speciﬁc features of the Hubbard model, the reader is referred to [314].

2.B Continuum limits
The Hubbard model is a lattice model. Some of its peculiar features, like the existence of two
su(2) symmetries, or the existence of certain kinds of bound states, which will be discussed
in later chapters, can be directly attributed to the discreteness of the lattice. Quite generally,
lattice models have a richer phenomenology than the continuum models they contain as
limiting cases. Still, these continuum models describe certain aspects of the physics of the
lattice model and may also be interesting on their own right.
How can we perform a continuum limit on Fermi operators? We shall start with certain
formal manipulations and, in the sequel, try to give them a more rigorous meaning. Let us
start with equations (2.13) and (2.14), which are the Fourier transformation formulae for
switching from creation operators of electrons in Wannier states to creation operators of
electrons in Bloch states. Shifting the limits of summation in (2.14) we obtain

such that
 = La0 .

(2.B.2)

Then the continuum is reached in the limit a0 → 0 for ﬁxed . Thus, L → ∞, k− → −∞
and k+ → ∞. Moreover, the position and momentum variables

At ﬁrst glance the sum on the right hand side of (2.B.5) is only a formal expression.
If we restrict ourselves, however, to the space generated by the action of ﬁnitely many
†
creation operators c̃k,a on a Fock vacuum |0 , this sum becomes perfectly sensible and
√
†
gives meaning to the rather terriﬁc expression lima0 →0 (cn,a / a0 )|x . Creation of ﬁnitely
many particles on inﬁnitely many sites means to consider a situation, where the density of
particles N /L is zero. This is in agreement with our intuitive understanding. The continuum
limit should work for low densities when all particles can be in states with small momenta.
Small momenta correspond to wave lengths large compared to the lattice constant.

Our result has two different interpretations. First, the Hubbard Hamiltonian is a lattice

Hamiltonian). If we rescale the coupling of the Hubbard model as u → a0 c, we obtain

where we choose the plus sign in (2.B.18) for deﬁniteness. From equation (2.B.19) we can
obtain the spectrum of the NLS Hamiltonian, once the spectrum of the Hubbard Hamiltonian
is known. The NLS Hamiltonian for electrons is exactly solvable and historically was the
ﬁrst Hamiltonian diagonalized by the nested Bethe ansatz [493].
A second interpretation of (2.B.17) and (2.B.18) is the following. There are four different
‘low density cases’, (2.B.13), where the NLS Hamiltonian is a good approximation to
the Hubbard Hamiltonian. The case (2.B.13a) will be discussed in Chapter 11, where we
consider the so-called gas phase. Note that the Hubbard Hamiltonian at ﬁnite coupling u
corresponds to the NLS Hamiltonian at inﬁnite coupling 2u/a0 .
Finally, let us investigate what happens to the two su(2) symmetries of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian in the continuum limit. Using the limit (2.B.13a) the spin operators S α (see

η-pairing symmetry of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. Similarly, the limit (2.B.13b) exists for
ηα , α = x, y, z and for S z , but not for S x and S y .

3
The Bethe ansatz solution

The bare existence of this book is due to the amazing fact that the solution of the stationary
Schrödinger equation for the one-dimensional Hubbard model can be reduced to a set of
algebraic equations, which is tractable in the thermodynamic limit. These equations will be
derived in this chapter. We will call them the Lieb-Wu equations to honour E. H. Lieb and
F. Y. Wu, who ﬁrst obtained them [298]. The derivation is based on a method, called the
nested (coordinate) Bethe ansatz, which goes back to the seminal articles of C. N. Yang [493]
and M. Gaudin [154], who generalized earlier work [60, 296] on exactly solvable models
to models with internal degrees of freedom.
The roots of the Lieb-Wu equations parameterize the eigenvalues and the eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. They encode the complete
information about the model. These roots are not explicitly known in the general N -particle
case. In the thermodynamic limit (N → ∞), however, only the distributions of the roots in
the complex plane matter, and many physical quantities can be calculated as solutions of
linear or non-linear Fredholm type integral equations. Moreover, it is sometimes possible
to use the Lieb-Wu equations in an implicit way even for ﬁnite N , e.g., in the proof of the
SO(4) highest weight properties of the eigenstates in Sections 3.D and 3.F of the appendix
or in the calculation of their norm in Section 3.5.
The thermodynamic limit and the derivation of suitable integral equations will be the
subject of the following chapters. Here we shall concentrate on the basic ideas of the nested
Bethe ansatz and shall derive the Bethe ansatz wave functions and the Lieb-Wu equations.
In Section 3.1 we take advantage of the particle number conservation. We deﬁne N -particle
wave functions and the N -particle Schrödinger equation they ought to satisfy. We explain
how periodic boundary conditions are dealt with within the Bethe ansatz, which is a rather
subtle point of the method. Section 3.2 is devoted to a careful study of the two-particle
problem. The presentation is aimed at the beginner. We show all details of the calculations.
An essential part of what is necessary to understand the N -particle problem can be learned
here. The results for the N -particle case are presented without derivation in Sections 3.3
and 3.4. The derivations have been placed in a number of appendices, where they are shown
in great detail. In Section 3.5 we describe our conjecture about the norm of the N -particle
eigenstates.

3.1 The Hamiltonian in ﬁrst quantization

51

The Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96) and the expressions (3.97) for the energy and
momentum eigenvalues are essential for the following chapters. They will be our starting
point for the exploration of the physical properties of the Hubbard model.

3.1 The Hamiltonian in ﬁrst quantization
Our goal in this chapter is to construct translationally invariant eigenstates of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian, i.e., we are looking for solutions of the stationary Schrödinger equation,
H |ψ = E|ψ ,

(3.1)

which at the same time solve the eigenvalue problem
Û |ψ = ω|ψ

(3.2)

for the shift operator. We may work with one of the three forms (2.22), (2.23) or (2.31) of
the Hubbard Hamiltonian. They mutually commute and thus have the same eigenfunctions.
For the time being let us choose (2.22).
In this section we take advantage of the fact that H and Û preserve the number of particles,
[H, N̂ ] = [Û , N̂ ] = 0. Hence, we may consider the eigenvalue problems (3.1), (3.2) in the
sectors of ﬁxed numbers of particles N = 0, 1, . . . , 2L. This corresponds to switching from
second to ﬁrst quantization, or from lattice quantum ﬁeld theory to quantum mechanics on
the lattice.
Let us consider an arbitrary N -particle state |ψ ∈ H(L) and an N -particle Wannier state
|x, a ∈ H(L) . By analogy with continuum models the amplitude
ψ(x; a) = x, a|ψ

(3.3)

is called the (N -particle) wave function. ψ(x; a) is a complex function of the positions
x = (x1 , . . . , x N ) and spins a = (a1 , . . . , a N ) of the electrons, and, by construction, is totally
antisymmetric under exchange of electrons.
The action of the Hamiltonian on Wannier states |x, a induces an action on the N -particle
wave function ψ(x; a). To conveniently express this action we introduce row vectors eα ,
α = 1, . . . , N , that have a one in column α and zeros elsewhere.
Let us ﬁrst calculate the action of the tight-binding part (2.12) of the Hubbard Hamiltonian
on a state |x, a . The elementary anticommutation relations (2.2) imply that
†

[c j,a c j±1,a , ck,b ] = c j,a {c j±1,a , ck,b } = δ j±1,k δab c j,a ,

Eψ(x; a), and it follows from (3.8) that ψ(x; a) solves the eigenvalue problem
(HN(L) − E)ψ(x; a) = 0 .

(3.12)

Thus, every N -particle solution of the eigenvalue problem (3.1) provides a solution of the
eigenvalue problem (3.12) for the cyclic N -particle Hamiltonian (3.10).

inverse. These formulae describe how to switch from second to ﬁrst quantization and vice
versa. A derivation of (3.13) is presented in appendix 3.A.

3.1 The Hamiltonian in ﬁrst quantization

53

We have just seen that, instead of dealing with (3.1), we may equivalently solve the
Schrödinger equation (3.12) for N = 0, 1, . . . , 2L. Due to the cyclic nature of the oneparticle shift operators ±j,L , however, equation (3.12) is still hard to deal with. Instead of
working directly with equation (3.12) the Bethe ansatz method proceeds in two separate
steps: let us introduce (non-cyclic) shift operators ±j ,
±j ψ(x; a) = ψ(x ± e j ; a) ,

(3.14)

j = 1, . . . , N , which necessarily act on functions ψ(x, a) deﬁned on the inﬁnite lattice. In
terms of these operators we deﬁne the Hamiltonian

(3.15)

Then the ﬁrst step in the Bethe ansatz calculation is to solve the difference equation
(HN − E)ψ(x; a) = 0

(3.16)

on the inﬁnite lattice, x ∈ Z N . In a second step we require the solutions of (3.16) to satisfy
the equations
(±j − ±j,L )ψ(x; a) = 0 ,

(3.17)

for x ∈ {1, . . . , L} N and j = 1, . . . , N . Obviously, every solution of (3.16) and (3.17)
provides a solution of (3.12). However, as we shall see below, the converse is not true. We
shall call equation (3.16) ‘the N -particle Schrödinger equation’ and equation (3.17) ‘the
periodic boundary conditions’.
Let us also translate the equation (3.2) for the shift operator into its ﬁrst quantized form.
From equation (2.43) we deduce
x, a|Û |ψ =

Note that there is no ordering required in the product on the right-hand side, since
[+j,L , +
k,L ] = 0. We now proceed similarly as in case of the Schrödinger equation. Every
eigenstate of Û with eigenvalue ω leads to
(Û N(L) − ω)ψ(x; a) = 0 ,

(3.19)

where Û N(L) is the cyclic shift operator in ‘coordinate representation’,
Û N(L) =

The Bethe ansatz solution

of the cyclic shift operator Û N(L) and solve the difference equation

(3.22)

subject to the periodic boundary conditions (3.17). Every solution of (3.22) that satisﬁes
(3.17) is a solution of (3.19).
In the following section we discuss (3.16), (3.22) and (3.17) in the simplest non-trivial
case of two particles. This will prepare us for the solution of the general N -particle case,
which is presented in Section 3.3 and derived in detail in appendix 3.B. The two-particle
case will help us to develop an intuitive understanding of the lattice model. We will learn,
for instance, that on the lattice there may be bound states of electrons, even though the
interaction is repulsive. Yang’s Y -operators, which are an essential technical tool in the
derivation of the solution of the N -particle problem, are easily introduced and understood
within the context of the two-particle problem. Finally, we shall see in the next section that
equations (3.16) and (3.17) are not equivalent to the N -particle eigenvalue problem (3.12).
They are sufﬁcient but not necessary. A solution of (3.12) exists, the so-called η-pair, which
does not follow directly from (3.16), (3.17) but indirectly by acting with the operator η+ on
the empty lattice |0 , which may be considered as a solution of (3.16), (3.17) in the sector
N = 0. This situation, exempliﬁed with the two-particle case, will turn out to be typical.
The empty lattice is a so-called Bethe ansatz state, i.e., by deﬁnition a solution of (3.16),
(3.17) of a certain form (see below). We shall see in Section 3.4 that all Bethe ansatz states
are annihilated by η− and that more eigenstates can be obtained by acting on Bethe ansatz
states with η+ .

3.2 Solution of the two-particle problem
We start our discussion of the Schrödinger equation (3.16) with a thorough discussion of
the two-particle case. In this case the Schrödinger equation reads
H2 ψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) = Eψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) ,

H2 = −(+

The equation (3.22) for the two-particle shift operator Û2 = +
1 2 is

Û2 ψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) = ωψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) .

(3.25)

In a ﬁrst step we shall construct common solutions of (3.23) and (3.25), which are totally
antisymmetric,
ψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) = −ψ(x2 , x1 ; a2 , a1 ) .

(3.26)

After imposing the periodic boundary conditions (3.17) in a second step these solutions
become two-particle, translationally invariant electronic wave functions corresponding to
the Hamiltonian (2.22).

3.2.1 Separation of variables
Since the ‘two-body potential’ 4uδx1 ,x2 depends only on the difference x1 − x2 , we expect
the Schrödinger equation (3.23) to separate after introducing centre of mass coordinates
m = x1 + x2 and relative coordinates n = x1 − x2 . Let
ψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) = f (m)g(n) ,

(3.27)

where we suppressed the spin variables on the right-hand side for brevity. Insertion of (3.27)
into (3.23) leads to
f (m + 1) + f (m − 1)
(4uδn,0 − E)g(n)
=
.
f (m)
g(n + 1) + g(n − 1)

(3.28)

The left hand side of this equation depends only on m, the right hand side depends only on
n. Hence it may be separated into
f (m + 1) + f (m − 1) = C f (m) ,
C(g(n + 1) + g(n − 1)) = (4uδn,0 − E)g(n) ,

(3.29)
(3.30)

where C is independent of m and n. Equations (3.29) and (3.30) are the discrete analogues
of the Schrödinger equation of a free particle and of a particle scattered by a delta-function
potential, respectively.

3.2.2 The centre of mass motion
Equation (3.29) is a second order linear difference equation with constant coefﬁcients. It has
two fundamental solutions, w±m , where w + 1/w = C. The general solution of equation
(3.29) is a linear combination
f (m) = A+ wm + A− w −m

(3.31)

of its fundamental solutions with two complex amplitudes A+ , A− . Assuming g(n) not to
be identically vanishing, the equation (3.25) for the shift operator is equivalent to
f (m + 2) = ω f (m) .

(3.32)

So (for w = 1), either A+ or A− in (3.31) must be zero, and we obtain, say, f (m) = A+ w m .
It follows that
ω = w2 .

(3.33)

The amplitude A+ may, in principle, be spin dependent. Since it merely appears as an overall
factor in equation (3.27), however, we may assume without any loss of generality that only
g(n) depends on the spin variables and that
f (m) = w m .

3.2.3 The relative motion
Let us assume for a while that C = 0. The degenerate case C = 0 will be discussed later.
Then, outside the origin, n = 0, equation (3.30) is a second order linear difference equation
with constant coefﬁcients. It has the general solution

For g(n) to be uniquely deﬁned at n = 0 it is necessary and sufﬁcient that

Furthermore, g(n) has to satisfy (3.30) at n = 0. This requirement leads to

Then, (3.41) turns into
(s1 − s2 )(A++ + A+− − A−+ − A−− ) = 4iu(A−− − A−+ ) .

(3.44)

3.2 Solution of the two-particle problem

57

Equations (3.39) and (3.44) are two equations that restrict the choice of the amplitudes
A . Further restrictions arise from the antisymmetry of the wavefunction (3.26), i.e., from
the fact that we are dealing with fermions. In order to implement these restrictions we have
to remember that the amplitudes Aαβ , α, β = ±, depend on the spin variables a1 , a2 = ↑, ↓.
αβ
The amplitudes Aαβ are spinors with components Aa1 a2 .
Let us introduce the permutation matrix  that interchanges the spin variables,
αβ

ab11 ab22 = δab21 δab12 .

(3.45)

Then
αβ

(Aαβ )a1 a2 = ab11 ab22 Ab1 b2 = Aaαβ2 a1 .

(3.46)

Here we used implicit summation over doubly occurring indices. The wave function
ψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) must be totally antisymmetric. Since f (m) = f (x1 + x2 ) is symmetric
in the electron coordinates and does not depend on the spin variables, we must have
g(−n) = −g(n). This leads to
A++ z −n − A+− z n = −A−+ z n + A−− z −n

(3.47)

for all n < 0. It follows that
A+− = A−+ ,

A++ = A−− .

(3.48)

Thus, we have obtained four conditions (equations (3.39), (3.44) and two equations (3.48))
on four amplitudes Aαβ . As we shall see below only three of these four conditions are
independent, and we will remain with a single free amplitude.
From this point there are two ways to proceed in our calculation. The more elementary
way is by assuming that the amplitudes Aαβ , α, β = ±, are either all symmetric or all
antisymmetric in the spin variables. This means to assume that the two electrons are in a
spin triplet or in a spin singlet state, which would be justiﬁed because the Hamiltonian H2 ,
equation (3.24), does not depend on the spin variables. This way of proceeding is, however,
not much in the spirit of the Bethe ansatz calculation for the N -electron system, and is
therefore not presented here, but left as an exercise to the reader. Instead, we will proceed
in a different way, that will naturally lead us to the introduction of the so-called Y -operators
of C. N. Yang. These operators play a crucial role in the generalization of the two-particle
results to an arbitrary number of particles N .
Let us insert (3.48) into (3.39) and (3.44). We obtain
(1 + )A−− = (1 + )A−+

and thus,

2iu + (s1 − s2 )

(3.53)

Equations (3.49) and (3.53) are two equations that connect A−− and A−+ . Are they compatible? The answer is yes. Since 2 = 1, we have (1 + ) = (1 + ), and (3.53) implies
(3.49).
Now we deﬁne the Y -operator
Y (λ) =

2iu + λ
.
2iu + λ

(3.54)

With the aid of this operator (3.53) can be written as
A−− = Y (s1 − s2 )A−+ .

(3.55)

Using (3.48) and (3.55) we can express all amplitudes Aαβ in (3.38) in terms of A−+ , and
g(n) takes the following form,

A−+ z n − Y (s1 − s2 )A−+ z −n
n≤0
g(n) =
(3.56)

Finally, we may insert (3.34) and (3.56) into (3.27). Because of (3.42) we have
wm z n = ei(k1 x1 +k2 x2 ) ,
and thus,
ψ(x1 , x2 ) =

By construction, ψ(x1 , x2 ) is a totally antisymmetric solution of the Schrödinger equation

in (3.23) and (3.25) are (see (3.36), (3.33))

(3.59)

The wavefunction ψ(x1 , x2 ) is determined by equation (3.58) up to an arbitrary function
A−+ of the spin variables a1 , a2 , which accounts for the fact that the Hamiltonian (3.24) is
spin independent. In general, A−+ is a linear combination of the spin singlet state

(3.65)

of the two-particle Schrödinger equation (3.23) and of the eigenvalue equation (3.25) for
the shift operator. The spin-singlet state (3.64) is antisymmetric in the spin variables and
symmetric in the electron coordinates while the situation is reversed for the spin-triplet
states (3.65). They are symmetric in the spin variables and antisymmetric in the electron
coordinates. For the latter reason two electrons never sit at the same site and therefore never
feel the local interaction. This makes the triplet wave functions look like the wave functions
of free electrons.
So far we have restricted our attention to the case C = 0, when equation (3.30) is nondegenerate. For C = 0 equation (3.30) turns into
(4uδn,0 − E)g(n) = 0 .

(3.66)

This equation has non-trivial solutions in two cases, (a) for E = 0 and (b) for E = 4u. In
case (a) we necessarily have g(0) = 0. In case (b), on the contrary, we must have g(n) = 0
for n = 0. In both cases f (m) is given by (3.34) with w2 = −1.
Let us consider case (a). In this case (3.38) is still a non-trivial solution of (3.66) for n = 0,
albeit not the most general one. Furthermore, if (3.39) and (3.40) are satisﬁed for E = 0,
then g(n) according to (3.38) is a solution of (3.66), and all the calculations following
(3.38) go through. We conclude that we may relax our restriction k1 + k2 = π mod 2π .
The function ψ(x1 , x2 ), equation (3.58), is a totally antisymmetric, translationally invariant
solution of the two-particle Schrödinger equation for arbitrary k1 , k2 ∈ C.
In case (b) the function g(n) is of the form g(n) = Aδn,0 . Antisymmetry requires
g(−n) = −g(n). It follows that A = −A, and thus, without any loss of generality,
g(n) = ϕa δn,0 = ϕa δx1 ,x2 . Inserting this result and f (m) = (±i)m into (3.27) we end up

60

The Bethe ansatz solution

with
ψ(x1 , x2 ) = ϕa (−1)x1 δx1 ,x2 .

(3.67)

As we shall see in the next subsection, this solution is also contained as a limit in our general
solution (3.58). It describes a bound state that is localized in the centre of mass frame.
Remark. It is clear from equation (3.56) that
X (s1 − s2 ) = Y (s1 − s2 )

(3.68)

is the two-particle S-matrix, since (3.56) for k1 , k2 ∈ R describes a scattering solution of
the Schrödinger equation (3.23). The operators X (λ) and Y (λ) play a crucial role in the
construction of the N -electron Bethe ansatz wavefunction (see appendix 3.B).

3.2.4 Eigenstates on the inﬁnite interval
So far we have constructed the joint solutions (3.64), (3.65) of the two-particle Schrödinger
equation (3.23) and the equation (3.25) for the shift operator. We have not yet speciﬁed the
boundary conditions. By imposing periodic boundary conditions the Schrödinger equation
(3.23) turns into an eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian H2 . The derivation of the
spectrum and the eigenfunctions of H2 under periodic boundary conditions is the main
purpose of this section and will be completed in the next subsection. Here we deviate from
our main line of reasoning and consider the Hamiltonian on the inﬁnite interval.
Any solution of the two-particle Schrödinger equation (3.23) which is bounded for
x1 , x2 → ±∞ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian on the inﬁnite interval. Hence, in
order to ﬁnd all eigenfunctions, we have to ﬁnd all values of k1 , k2 ∈ C for which our
general solutions (3.64) and (3.65) are bounded. Clearly, this is the case for all real k1 , k2 .
When k1 and k2 are real, the spin singlet and spin triplet states (3.64) and (3.65) describe the
scattering of two electrons. The energy of the scattering states is given by (3.59). Note that
for ﬁxed k1 , k2 the spin singlet state and the spin triplet states belong to degenerate energy
eigenvalues. This degeneracy is peculiar of the system on the inﬁnite interval and is lifted
by periodic boundary conditions (see next subsection). Later, in Chapter 15, we shall see
that the degeneracy is due to an additional so-called Yangian symmetry (see Chapter 14),
which occurs in the thermodynamic limit.
Is it possible to have eigenstates with non-real k1 and k2 ? The answer is different for
the spin-singlet and spin-triplet solutions, respectively. If k1 or k2 in (3.65) has non-zero
imaginary part, the wave function is always unbounded. Thus, k1 and k2 must be real in the
spin triplet state. Similarly, the spin singlet solution (3.64) is easily seen to be unbounded, if
s1 − s2 = 2iu. For s1 − s2 = 2iu, however, the two scattering amplitudes in (3.64) vanish,
and the spin singlet solution simpliﬁes to
ψ(x1 , x2 ) = ϕa ei(k1 +k2 )(x1 +x2 )/2 e−i(k1 −k2 )|x1 −x2 |/2 .

(3.69)

3.2 Solution of the two-particle problem

61

This solution is bounded, if and only if Im(k1 + k2 ) = 0 and Im(k1 − k2 ) ≤ 0, and there is
indeed a possibility to have non-real k1 and k2 of the form k1 = q1 − iκ, k2 = q2 + iκ with
q1 , q2 ∈ [0, 2π], κ > 0. Assuming u = 0, the condition s1 − s2 = 2iu implies q1 = q2 and,
using the shorthand notation q = q1 = q2 ,

and u > 0, or for π2 < |q − π |
The latter equation is compatible with κ > 0 for π2 < q < 3π
2
< π and u < 0.
We thus have obtained the one-parameter family of eigenstates
ψ(x1 , x2 ) = ϕa eiq(x1 +x2 ) e−κ(q)|x1 −x2 |

(3.71)

of the Hubbard Hamiltonian on the inﬁnite interval. ψ(x1 , x2 ) describes a bound state, which
is moving with centre of mass momentum q. The interesting point about this state is that
it exists even if the interaction between the electrons is repulsive (u > 0). The existence of
a bound state for repulsive coupling is a lattice effect. In fact, in the continuum limit (see
appendix 2.B), when we replace q by a0 q, κ by a0 κ, u by a0 c and take the limit a0 → 0 for
ﬁxed κ, q and c, equation (3.70) turns into κ = −c, and κ can only be positive for negative c.
Hence, there are no bound states in the continuum model if the interaction is repulsive.
Let us note that the bound state solution (3.71) turns into (3.67) in the limit q → π2 .

3.2.5 Periodic boundary conditions
Next, we want to single out those of the wave functions ψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) that satisfy the
periodic boundary conditions (3.17). In the two-particle case equations (3.17) reduce to
four non-trivial conditions,
ψ(0, x2 ; a) = ψ(L , x2 ; a) ,

ψ(L + 1, x2 ; a) = ψ(1, x2 ; a) ,

(3.72a)

ψ(x1 , 0; a) = ψ(x1 , L; a) ,

ψ(x1 , L + 1; a) = ψ(x1 , 1; a) .

(3.72b)

Because of the antisymmetry it is sufﬁcient to consider one pair of equations. They are
equivalent to one another. Suppose, for instance, that (3.72a) is satisﬁed; then
ψ(x1 , 0; a1 , a2 ) = −ψ(0, x1 ; a2 , a1 ) = −ψ(L , x1 ; a2 , a1 ) = ψ(x1 , L; a1 , a2 ) ,

(3.73)

which is the ﬁrst equation (3.72b).
Let us insert the wave function (3.58) into the ﬁrst equation (3.72a), and let x2 ∈
{1, . . . , L}. Using Y (λ)Y (−λ) = 1 we obtain


eik1 L Y (s1 − s2 ) − e−ik1 L A−+ eik2 x2

−eik2 L Y (s1 − s2 ) Y (s2 − s1 ) − e−ik2 L A−+ eik1 x2 = 0 .

(3.75a)
(3.75b)

Equations (3.75) are also necessary, if k1 = k2 , since, in this case, the functions eik1 x2 and
eik2 x2 are linearly independent. Inserting the wave function (3.58) into the second equation
(3.72a) we obtain an equation which is similar to (3.74) and leads again to (3.75). Thus,
the equations (3.75) are sufﬁcient for ψ(x1 , x2 ; a1 , a2 ) to satisfy the periodic boundary
conditions (3.72).
From the explicit form
X (s1 − s2 ) =

s1 − s2 + 2iu
s1 − s2 + 2iu

(3.76)

of the two-particle S-matrix X (s1 − s2 ) we see that every eigenvector of the permutation
matrix  is an eigenvector of X (s1 − s2 ). The eigenvectors of  are the spin singlet and
spin triplet states (see (3.63)). Applying X (s1 − s2 ) to (3.61) and (3.62) we obtain
s1 − s2 − 2iu
ϕa ,
s1 − s2 + 2iu
X (s1 − s2 )ϕs = ϕs .

X (s1 − s2 )ϕa =

(3.77a)
(3.77b)

Hence, equations (3.75) are satisﬁed, if A−+ = ϕa and if the ‘charge momenta’ k1 and k2
satisfy the quantization conditions
eik1 L =

s1 − s2 + 2iu
,
s1 − s2 − 2iu

eik2 L =

s2 − s1 + 2iu
.
s2 − s1 − 2iu

(3.78)

Similarly, in the spin-triplet case A−+ = ϕs , we obtain the quantization conditions
eik1 L = eik2 L = 1 .

(3.79)

The corresponding wave functions are given by (3.64) and (3.65), the energies and eigenvalues of the shift operator by (3.59) and (3.60).
The wave functions (3.64) and the wave functions (3.65) with ϕs (a1 , a2 ) = δa1 ,↑ δa2 ,↑
are the so-called Bethe-ansatz eigenfunctions of the two-particle Hubbard Hamiltonian
in ‘coordinate representation’ (3.24). In the next section we shall generalize these wave
functions to the many particle case. The solutions of equations (3.78) and (3.79) and the
issue of completeness will be discussed in Chapter 4.
Remark. The alert reader may wonder how our general result in the next sections compares
for N = 2, M = 1 with (3.78). In general, except for the charge momenta, we have a second
set of quantum numbers that characterize the spin degrees of freedom. For N = 2, M = 1

3.2 Solution of the two-particle problem

To reproduce (3.78) from these equations one has to solve (3.81) for λ and has to insert the
result, λ = (s1 + s2 )/2, into (3.80).
3.2.6 The η-pair
An important issue in the context of the Bethe ansatz method is the question of completeness. We shall elaborate on this question in Chapter 4, where we are counting eigenstates. Here we want to point out a subtlety which is closely related to the completeness
problem.
Consider the solution ψ(x1 , x2 ) = ϕa (−1)x1 δx1 ,x2 (see equation (3.67)) of the two-particle
Schrödinger equation. Clearly this solution is incompatible with the periodic boundary
conditions (3.72). For we have, for instance, ψ(0, L) = 0 = ψ(L , L) = ϕa (−1) L . Hence,
this solution is outside the Bethe ansatz. On the other hand, the reader may easily verify
that this solution is an eigenfunction of the cyclic N -particle Hubbard Hamiltonian H2(L) ,
equation (3.10):
(H2(L) ψ)(x1 , x2 ) = 4u ψ(x1 , x2 ) ,

(3.82)

if L is even. We learn from this example that the N -particle Schrödinger equation (3.16) and
the periodic boundary conditions (3.17) do not determine all eigenfunctions of the cyclic
N -particle Hubbard Hamiltonian HN(L) . We claim, however, that the states missed by the
Bethe ansatz can be obtained by acting with symmetry operators on Bethe ansatz states (see
Section 3.4). In the present case this statement means the following. Let us use equation
(3.13) to switch back to the language of second quantization. We obtain

Comparing the latter result with our deﬁnition (2.80a) of the operator η+ , we see that
|ψ = η+ |0 .

(3.84)

The state |ψ is obtained by acting with the operator η+ on the Fock vacuum. |ψ is not
a Bethe ansatz state but |0 is. We shall see below that our example is typical. For even L
all N -particle Bethe ansatz states (see Section 3.3) are lowest weight states with respect

64

The Bethe ansatz solution

to the η-spin representation of su(2). Multiplets of eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian
are thus generated by acting with η+ on the Bethe ansatz states.
We should mention here that a similar statement holds for the spin su(2) symmetry. Our
method of solving the N -particle generalization of the eigenvalue problem (3.75) will give
us at ﬁrst instance only those eigenstates which are highest weight with respect to spin. The
missing states then can be obtained by acting with the ladder operator S − on the highest
weight states. Applying our general result to the two-particle problem, we would obtain
only one of the spin triplet states, namely ϕs (a1 , a2 ) = δa1 ,↑ δa2 ,↑ .

3.3 Many-particle wave functions and Lieb-Wu equations
Now we shall show how the results of the previous section generalize to an arbitrary number of electrons. We shall see that the general N -particle Bethe ansatz eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) parametrically depend on two sets of quantum numbers: the charge momenta k j , j = 1, . . . , N , which also determine the total
momentum and the energy of the Bethe ansatz states, and the spin rapidities λ ,  =
1, . . . , M. The charge momenta and spin rapidities obey a set of coupled algebraic equations that basically arise as a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions. These
algebraic equations are the Lieb-Wu equations mentioned in the introduction to this
chapter.
The derivation of the Bethe ansatz eigenstates and the Lieb-Wu equations is rather lengthy
and technical and is therefore presented separately in appendix 3.B. Here we concentrate on
the mere description of the result which we recommend the readers to familiarize themselves
with before studying its derivation.

3.3.1 The symmetric group
In this section and also in appendix 3.B where the results of this section are derived, we shall
resort to some basic knowledge of the symmetric group. We therefore begin by recalling
a few facts and introduce notations appropriate for our purposes. The symmetric group of
order N , S N , is the group of permutations of N distinct objects. In more mathematical
terms we may deﬁne S N as the set of all one-to-one mappings of the set of numbers
Z N = {1, . . . , N } onto itself.
A transposition  j,k is a permutation that interchanges j and k and leaves all other
elements of Z N ﬁxed. The symmetric group S N is generated by the transpositions n,n+1 ,
n = 1, . . . , N − 1, of nearest neighbours. A realization of a permutation as a product of
transpositions of nearest neighbours is, of course, not unique. But for a given permutation
the number of factors is always either odd or even. Accordingly, a permutation is called
odd or even. This deﬁnes the sign function or parity on S N : sign(Q) = 1, if Q is even, and
sign(Q) = −1, if Q is odd. Clearly sign(P Q) = sign(P)sign(Q), sign(Q −1 ) = sign(Q),
and sign( j,k ) = −1. It follows that the even permutations form a subgroup A N of S N .

3.3 Many-particle wave functions and Lieb-Wu equations

65

This subgroup is called the alternating group. Any transposition  j,k generates a coset
decomposition, S N = A N ∪  j,k A N = A N ∪ A N  j,k .
The symmetric group S N has a natural action on N -component row vectors,
xQ = (x Q(1) , . . . , x Q(N ) ) = x Q(α) eα = xα e Q

(3.86)

For the Euclidean scalar product
k, x = kα xα

(3.87)

k, xQ = kα x Q(α) = k Q −1 (α) xα = kQ −1 , x .

(3.88)

we ﬁnd that

The matrix Q −1 is therefore equal to the transposed Q t of Q, and the representation (3.85)
is orthogonal with respect to the scalar product (3.87).

3.3.2 Many-particle wave functions and Lieb-Wu equations
The Bethe ansatz eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) for N electrons and M down
M
spins are characterized by two sets of quantum numbers {k j } Nj=1 and {λ }=1
, 2M ≤ N ≤ L.
It is convenient to group these quantum numbers into row vectors k = (k1 , . . . , k N ) and
λ = (λ1 , . . . , λ M ). The Bethe ansatz eigenstates may then be represented as (see (3.13))

(3.89)

where ψ(x; a|k; λ ) is the N -particle Bethe ansatz wave function derived in appendix 3.B
and described below.
The Bethe ansatz wave function depends on the relative ordering of the coordinates x j .
Any ordering is assigned to a permutation Q ∈ S N through the inequality
1 ≤ x Q(1) ≤ x Q(2) ≤ · · · ≤ x Q(N ) ≤ L .

(3.90)

The inequality (3.90) divides the conﬁguration space of N electrons into N ! sectors, which
can be labeled by the permutations Q. In sector Q the Bethe ansatz wave functions take the
form

with spin dependent amplitudes aQ|kP, λ derived in appendices 3.B and 3.E. The amplitudes are again of ‘Bethe ansatz form’. They are the Bethe ansatz wave functions of an

In the above equations y j denotes the position of the jth down spin in the sequence

aQ|kP, λ vanishes. An alternative expression for aQ|kP, λ based on the terminology
of the algebraic Bethe ansatz can be found in appendix 3.B.
The quantum numbers k j , j = 1, . . . , N , and λ ,  = 1, . . . , M, may in general be complex. We call them charge momenta and spin rapidities, respectively. They have to be
calculated from the Lieb-Wu equations (or ‘periodic boundary conditions’)

Throughout this volume we will restrict our discussion to solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations
which are ﬁnite and have a maximum number of charge momenta and spin rapidities ﬁxed
by the condition 2M ≤ N ≤ L. These solutions will sometimes be called regular [125].
The restriction to regular solutions will become particularly important in Chapter 4 where
the completeness problem is discussed.

Equations (3.95)–(3.97) are the most important result of this chapter. They determine the
spectrum of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31). They are the starting point of our exploration
of the physical properties of the Hubbard model. In the following chapters these equations
will be used to study the ground state and the elementary excitations of the Hubbard model
in the thermodynamic limit. They will be used to study the thermodynamics of the Hubbard

3.4 Symmetry properties of wave functions and states

model. Moreover, ﬁnite size corrections to the thermodynamic limit will allow us to calculate
the asymptotics of correlation functions within the so-called conformal approach.

3.4 Symmetry properties of wave functions and states
3.4.1 Symmetries under permutations
The eigenfunctions (3.91) have the following symmetry properties under permutations of
electrons and quantum numbers:
ψ(xR; aR|k; λ ) = sign(R)ψ(x; a|k; λ ) ,

R ∈ SN ,

(3.98a)

ψ(x; a|kR; λ ) = sign(R)ψ(x; a|k; λ ) ,

R ∈ SN ,

(3.98b)

ψ(x; a|k; λ R) = ψ(x; a|k; λ ) ,

M

R∈S ,

(3.98c)

i.e., they are antisymmetric with respect to interchange of any two charge momenta k j and
symmetric with respect to interchange of any two spin rapidities λ . They are antisymmetric
with respect to simultaneous exchange of spin and space coordinates of two electrons, and
hence respect the Pauli principle. Equation (3.98) are derived in appendix 3.B.

3.4.2 SO(4) multiplets
In appendix 3.D and appendix 3.F we work out the action of the spin operators and the
η-spin operators on the Bethe ansatz states. It turns out that
S + |ψk,λλ = 0 ,

(3.99)

S z |ψk,λλ = 12 (N − 2M)|ψk,λλ .

(3.100)

The Bethe ansatz states are highest weight states of the total spin with highest weight
1
(N − 2M). Similarly, for even length L of the lattice, they are lowest weight states of the
2
η-spin,
η− |ψk,λλ = 0 ,

(3.101)

η z |ψk,λλ = 12 (N − L)|ψk,λλ .

(3.102)

We have seen in Section 2.2.5 that for even L both, spin and η-spin, are conserved and
that spin and η-spin operators mutually commute. We conclude that the action of the ladder
operators S − and η+ on a Bethe ansatz state generates a degenerate multiplet of eigenstates
of dimension (N − 2M + 1)(L − N + 1).
Instead of working with the spin operators S ± , S z , let us introduce an alternative set of
generators
ζ = S+ ,

ζ † = S− ,

ζ z = −S z .

(3.103)

68

The Bethe ansatz solution

These operators were used in [125], where equations (3.99)-(3.102) were ﬁrst derived. They
satisfy the commutation relations
[ζ, ζ † ] = −2ζ z ,

[ζ z , ζ ] = −ζ ,

[ζ z , ζ † ] = ζ † .

(3.104)

For these alternative spin operators the spin multiplets are turned upside down, and the
Bethe ansatz states are lowest weight states,
ζ |ψk,λλ = 0 ,
ζ

z

|ψk,λλ = 12 (2M − N )|ψk,λλ

(3.105)
.

(3.106)

Every Bethe ansatz state |ψk,λλ generates the su(2)⊕su(2) multiplet of degenerate eigenstates
|ψk,λλ,α,β = (ζ † )α (η+ )β |ψk,λλ ,

(3.107)

α = 0, . . . , N − 2M; β = 0, . . . , L − N . Recall that for the Bethe ansatz states N ≥ 2M
and L ≥ N . Thus, α and β are non-negative. Furthermore, we assume L to be even. This is
necessary for the η-spin to be conserved (see section 2.2.5).
It was ﬁrst noted in [497] that spin and η-spin in the multiplets (3.107) are not arbitrary.
Since
(ζ z + η z )|ψk,λλ = (M − L/2)|ψk,λλ

(3.108)

and L is even, the highest values of ζ z and η z must be either both odd or both even. Hence,
not all possible su(2)⊕su(2) multiplets can occur for ﬁxed even L. The multiplets (0, 0),
( 12 , 12 ), (0, 1), (1, 0), . . . are allowed, while, for instance, the multiplet (0, 12 ) can not occur.
This fact is called Z2 -factorization. As a consequence the symmetry, when lifted to the
group level, is (SU(2) × SU(2))/Z2 ∼
= SO(4) rather than SU(2) × SU(2).
We shall argue in Chapter 4 that the set (3.107) of all states |ψk,λλ,α,β is complete. In
other words, we argue that the Bethe ansatz together with the SO(4) symmetry provides all
eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian.

3.5 The norm of the eigenfunctions
In this section we present a conjecture for the norm of the eigenstates (3.89) which was
formulated in [175]. The proof of this conjecture is still an open problem. Judging from
our experience with other Bethe ansatz solvable models, it seems likely that a proof will
not be achieved within the coordinate Bethe ansatz method, and will rather rely on a better
understanding of the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model (see Chapter 12).
To prepare for our formulation of the norm conjecture, we must ﬁrst rewrite the Lieb-Wu
equations in several different ways. In particular, we introduce a generating function for the
logarithmic form of the Lieb-Wu equations, which plays a similar role as the Yang-Yang
action [496] does in case of the Bose gas with delta-function interaction.

even.
In order to formulate the norm conjecture we shall introduce certain functions connected
to the logarithmic form (3.109), (3.110) of the Lieb-Wu equations. We shall start with the

Here we have to insert the explicit expressions (3.91)-(3.94) on the right-hand side. After
carrying out the trivial summation over the spin orientations we are left with a sum over
all electron coordinates and a double sum over the symmetric group. These sums are hard
to evaluate, in particular, because the charge momenta and spin rapidities are not arbitrary,
but must satisfy the Lieb-Wu equations. This is the reason why at the present time we can
only offer a conjecture for the square of the norm of the Hubbard wave function (3.91). The
following formula was proposed in [175],

The norm is thus proportional to the Hessian determinant of the action S regarded as a
function of the charge momenta k j and spin rapidities λ . Recalling the formulation (3.115)
of the Lieb-Wu equations we see that a solution is non-degenerate (locally unique for ﬁxed
values of n cj and n s ), if the norm of the corresponding wave function does not vanish. In
other words, all eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) correspond to non-degenerate
solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations.
Another interesting form of the norm formula is obtained by expressing the Hessian
determinant in equation (3.120) in terms of the momenta of elementary charge and spin
excitations χ j and ϕl ,

The norm is proportional to the Jacobian of the transformation from the set of charge
momenta and spin rapidities k j , λ to the set of momenta of charge and spin degrees of
freedom χ j , ϕ .
Let us list the arguments in support of (3.120):
(i) The experience with other Bethe ansatz solvable models [268,373,409,448] shows that
norm formulae for Bethe ansatz wave functions are generically of the form (3.120).
(ii) It is easy to see that (3.120) is valid for M = 0 and arbitrary N .
(iii) (3.120) was veriﬁed for M = 1 and N = 2, 3. The calculation is lengthy and involves
highly non-trivial cancellations based on the Lieb-Wu equations.
(iv) (3.120) was veriﬁed for arbitrary N and M in the limit u → ∞. This limit requires
rescaling of the spin rapidities, λ j = 2u λ̃ j . The remaining non-trivial factor in the
expression for the norm reduces to the case of the XXX spin- 12 chain, and the result
of [268] can be applied.
(v) For arbitrary N and M the leading order term of the norm in the large L limit can be
calculated. This term is proportional to L N and ﬁxes the prefactor in (3.120).

The Bethe ansatz solution

3.6 Conclusions
We have mapped the problem of solving the Schrödinger equation for the Hubbard model
to the problem of solving the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96). The Lieb-Wu equations
are of primary importance for our further investigation of the one-dimensional Hubbard
model in the following chapters. They were obtained by Lieb and Wu in [298]. The wave
function (3.91)-(3.94) is not in Lieb and Wu’s original paper, but in the form presented
here ﬁrst appears in the literature in Woynarovich’s article [481]. The SO(4) highest weight
properties of the Bethe ansatz states were proven in [125]. The norm formula (3.120) was
proposed in [175]. Its proof is one of the interesting open problems for the one-dimensional
Hubbard model.
The reader who is interested in the derivations of the results presented in this chapter
may continue with the appendices. In appendix 3.A we recall some basic facts about the
formalism of the second quantization. The remaining appendices contain rigorous derivations of the Lieb-Wu equations, the Bethe ansatz wave functions, and the SO(4) highest
weight properties in the general N -particle case. We also discuss the limiting cases of large
and small coupling and the continuum limit in appendix 3.G. Alternative accounts of the
derivation of the Lieb-Wu equations can be found in [95, 423].

Appendices to Chapter 3

3.A Scalar products and projection operators
Here we recall a number of textbook formulae for switching from second to ﬁrst quantization
and back that are needed in Chapter 3.
We shall use the shorthand notation
Z L = {1, . . . , L} .

(3.A.1)

For the values ↑, ↓ of the spin variables we identify ↑ with 1 and ↓ with 2. It is then natural
to deﬁne ↑<↓. The coordinates x j and spin variables a j of electrons on a ring of L sites take
values in Z L and Z2 , respectively. The positions and spins of N electrons are determined
by row vectors x ∈ Z LN and a ∈ Z2N .
Let us recall the construction of the Fock space. The Fock space is built by the action of
†
fermionic creation operators cx,a on a Fock vacuum |0 . The Fock vacuum is annihilated
by any annihilation operator,
cx,a |0 = 0 ,

(3.A.2)

x ∈ Z L , a ∈ Z2 . In order to be able to consider expectation values of operators, we need a
†
dual Fock vacuum 0| that satisﬁes 0|cx,a = 0 and
0|0 = 1 .

(3.A.3)

Using (3.A.2), (3.A.3) and the canonical anticommutation relations between the Fermi
operators, we can calculate expectation values 0|A|0 of arbitrary operators A that are
linear combinations of products of Fermi operators. For instance,

Here we used the elementary anticommutators to move cx N ,a N to the very right. The right

the last row. Hence, by hypothesis, (3.A.6) is true for every positive N .
It is sometimes useful to consider pairs (x j , a j ) ∈ Z L × Z2 as the ‘coordinates of an
electron’ (see [283]). Such pairs have a natural ordering ‘<’ deﬁned by (x j , a j ) < (xk , ak ),
if x j ≤ xk and a j < ak for x j = xk .

non-zero, and there is a permutation P ∈ S N such that |x, a = sign(P)|xP, aP and

3.B Derivation of Bethe ansatz wave functions and Lieb-Wu equations
This appendix contains a detailed derivation of the Bethe ansatz wave functions and of the
Lieb-Wu equations in the general N -particle case. Since the derivation is slightly lengthy,
let us outline what we are going to do.

3.B Derivation of Bethe ansatz wave functions

77

(i) In the next section we try to motivate the choice (3.B.19) of the Bethe ansatz wave
function and explain some of its elementary properties.
(ii) In Section 3.B.2 the wave function (3.B.19) is inserted into the Schrödinger equation
(3.16) which results in a single equation (3.B.22) for the amplitudes A(kP|aQ). This
equation is then interpreted in the language of an auxiliary spin system and is shown
to be equivalent to the recursion relation (3.B.31) over the symmetric group S N .
(iii) In Section 3.B.3 (with some details postponed to appendix 3.C) we show that the
recursion has a unique solution independent of the realization of a permutation as a
product of transpositions of nearest neighbours. This brings us into ﬁrst contact with
the important Yang-Baxter equation (3.B.35).
(iv) In Section 3.B.4 we impose the periodic boundary conditions (3.17) onto the Bethe
ansatz wave function (3.B.19) with amplitudes deﬁned by (3.B.31). This reduces the
solution of the N -particle problem to that of an auxiliary eigenvalue problem for an
inhomogeneous spin system related to the XXX Heisenberg chain.
(v) In Section 3.B.5 we solve the spin problem by an algebraic technique called the algebraic Bethe ansatz (we shall have to say more about it in Chapter 12). The eigenvalue
(3.B.85) of the spin problem depends on the quasi momenta {k j } in the Bethe ansatz
wave function. They appear as inhomogeneities in the spin problem and have to be chosen in accordance with the periodic boundary conditions. This determines the Lieb-Wu
equations.
3.B.1 The Bethe ansatz wave function
In the following we construct joint antisymmetric solutions of the Schrödinger equation
(3.16) and the equation (3.22) for the shift operator, i.e., we require the solutions to satisfy
ψ(xR; aR) = sign(R)ψ(x; a)

(3.B.1)

for all R ∈ S N . Here we resort to the notation for the symmetric group introduced in
Section 3.3.1. Its full power and usefulness will become apparent below. Equation (3.B.1)
encodes the fact that electrons are fermions which ought to satisfy the Pauli principle. The
antisymmetry of the wave function is essential for the Bethe ansatz to work. The so-called
bosonic Hubbard model which has the same ‘ﬁrst quantized’ Hamiltonian (3.15) but totally
symmetric wave functions can not be solved by Bethe ansatz (see [83]).
The Bethe ansatz starts with a clever guess (an ansatz) for the form of the so-called Bethe
ansatz wave function. It is a multiparametric function which has the essential properties of
the solution. The actual calculation then determines the parameters (the quantum numbers)
in the Bethe ansatz wave function.
The form of the Bethe ansatz wave function can not be rigorously derived, but will be
fully justiﬁed only a posteriori, at the end of the calculation. It can only be motivated, and the
physical intuition behind it can be explained. This is the aim of the following considerations
which are based on three ideas: locality of the Schrödinger equation, existence of ‘higher
conserved quantities’ and antisymmetry of the wave function.

78

Appendices to Chapter 3

Let us ﬁrst see what can be learned from locality and antisymmetry. The Schrödinger
equation (3.16) has to be satisﬁed for all x ∈ Z N . Because of the antisymmetry (3.B.1),
however, it sufﬁces to consider it in one of the the elementary domains

But for x ∈ D Q no two electrons occupy the same lattice site, and the local interaction does
not matter. We have

α n f (0) = Aeikn ( f (0), α, A, k complex numbers), which is unique up to normalization.
Out of the one-particle solutions we can construct solutions f (x|k) = Aei k,x of (3.B.4).
We ﬁnd that
(HN − E) f (x|k) = 0 ,

(3.B.6)

The N -particle shift operator Û N commutes with the N -particle Hamiltonian,
[HN , Û N ] = 0. Therefore it is possible to construct a system of common eigenfunctions of
HN and Û N . The functions f (x|k) satisfy
(Û N − ω) f (x|k) = 0

(3.B.7)

ω = ei(k1 +···+k N ) .

We conclude from the above considerations that the translationally invariant eigenfunctions of the Hubbard Hamiltonian must be linear combinations of the functions f (x|k) with
degenerate eigenvalues E and ω, (3.B.6) and (3.B.8).
There is a trivial degeneracy due to the invariance under permutations of the individual
k j : the common solution f (x|k) of (3.B.4) and (3.B.7) is degenerate with f (x|kP) for all
P ∈ S N . In general, for a ﬁxed vector k, we have no further degeneracy (E is also invariant
under a change of signs of the individual k j , but ω is not). Still, more degenerate solutions

(3.B.9)

It is now an interesting observation that the equations (3.B.9) restrict the possible choices
of k. They can be interpreted as constraints on k. Let us consider the case N = 2. In this
case (3.B.9) implies (a) {k1 , k2 } = {k1 , k2 } mod 2π , or (b) k1 + k2 = k1 + k2 = π mod 2π .
Case (b) corresponds to E = 0 and has been discussed in Section 3.2. In the generic
situation E = 0 case (a) applies, and f (x|k) and f (x|k ) are non-degenerate, unless
{k1 , k2 } = {k1 , k2 } mod 2π .
Imagine there were more mutually commuting quantities In , having f (x|k) as a common
eigenfunction and commuting with Û and H . There would be more constraints than just
the two equations (3.B.9). If the number of constraints would equal the number of particles,
this could render f (x|k) and f (x|k ) to be non-degenerate as common eigenfunctions of
all of the In , Û and H for generic choice of k and k = kP.
For the Hubbard model, higher conserved quantities actually exist that have the above
properties (see Chapter 12). This motivates the ansatz

for a joint solution of the Schrödinger equation (3.16) and the equation for the shift operator (3.B.7) in the sector D Q . Note that ã(P, Q) = a(P Q −1 , Q). The ansatz (3.B.10)
is called Bethe ansatz or Bethe-Yang hypothesis and was introduced by C. N. Yang
in his seminal paper [493] on the electron gas with delta-function interaction. Let us
emphasize that the peculiar feature of (3.B.10) is the occurrence of only one wave
vector k.
There is the following physical picture behind (3.B.10), which was stressed by Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov [502]. Assume for a while the components of k be real. Then
(3.B.10) describes a scattering state of N particles. For a classical system of N interacting
particles passing from a sector Q to a sector Q  means to change the order of the particles. Thus, the particles have scattered each other. Assuming the same wave vector k in
every sector Q means to assume that the individual k j are conserved under scattering of
the particles. The particles merely exchange their momenta. Mere exchange of momenta
is characteristic of two-particle scattering. This means we assume the N -particle scattering
process to be a sequence of two-particle scattering processes.
Generally, there is no conservation of the set of individual momenta {k j } in N -particle
scattering. Conservation of the set of individual k j is typical for integrable systems. For a
beautiful classical example see [330].
So far the ansatz (3.B.10) says nothing about the internal degrees of freedom of the
particles and nothing about symmetry. Let us try to include these features: the Hubbard
model is a model of electrons. We are thus seeking for solutions ψ(x; a|k) of the Schrödinger
equation (3.16) which satisfy Pauli’s principle (3.B.1). The dependence of our ansatz wave

function (3.B.10) on spin a and wave vector k has to be incorporated into the coefﬁcients,
ã(P, Q) = ã(P, Q, k, a).
Let x ∈ D Q , y = xR, b = aR, R ∈ S N . Then x Q( j) = y R −1 Q( j) and y ∈ D R −1 Q . The wave

for arbitrary x ∈ D Q and arbitrary k. Hence, the Pauli principle is satisﬁed if and only if
ã(P, R −1 Q, k, aR) = sign(R)ã(P, Q, k, a) .

(3.B.13)

This equation ﬁxes ã in all sectors D Q , once it is known in a speciﬁc sector. In order to
simplify further calculations we make the ansatz
ã(P, Q, k, a) = sign(P Q)A(kP|aQ) ,

(3.B.14)

which clearly satisﬁes (3.B.13) and acquires further motivation by the results of Section 3.2
about the two-particle problem.
So far we have constructed an ansatz wave function with the following properties. It
is deﬁned inside the sectors D Q , where it satisﬁes the Schrödinger equation (3.16) and
the equation of the shift operator (3.B.7) (with the same values of E and ω in every
sector). It is totally antisymmetric under simultaneous permutations of x and a, equation (3.B.1). Our speciﬁcation of ã in equation (3.B.14) also forces antisymmetry under
exchange of the components k j of the wave vector k. For, let x ∈ D Q , R ∈ S N . Then,
using (3.B.10)

ψ(x; a|kR) =
sign(P Q)A(kR P|aQ)ei kR P,xQ = sign(R)ψ(x; a|k) ,

where the second equality follows from RS N = S N and sign(R −1 ) = sign(R). We infer
from (3.B.15) that ψ(x; a|k) vanishes identically (or is singular), if two of the k j are the
same. We may therefore assume below, that the k j be mutually distinct.
Let us now try to extend our ansatz to the boundaries of the sectors D Q . First we have
to make sure that (3.B.10) and (3.B.14) deﬁne ψ(x; a|k) uniquely on the boundaries. x is
on the boundary of D Q , if there is an n, such that x Q(n) = x Q(n+1) . x is then invariant under
permutation of x Q(n) and x Q(n+1) ,

any transposition of nearest neighbours.
Provided that (3.B.18) is satisﬁed, our wave function is now uniquely deﬁned as a function

For every given x the permutation Q on the right hand side has to be chosen such that
x ∈ D Q . ψ(x; a|k) solves the Schrödinger equation (3.16) for every x ∈ D Q , Q ∈ S N .

boundaries of the sectors D Q . This will provide conditions on the amplitudes A(kP|aQ).

Let us start with the case of three or more electrons sitting at the same site. Then x Q(n−1) =
x Q(n) = x Q(n+1) at the boundary of some sector D Q , and, say, a Q(n) = a Q(n+1) (recall that

Here we used the fact that ψ(x; a|k) is antisymmetric in x Q(n) and x Q(n+1) , which
follows from a Q(n) = a Q(n+1) . In the ﬁfth row of (3.B.20) this antisymmetry implies
ψ(x ± e Q(n+1) ; a|k) = −ψ(x ± e Q(n) ; a|k).
We have seen that the Schrödinger equation (3.16) is satisﬁed, if three or more electrons
are sitting at the same site of the lattice. We are thus left with the problem of pairs of
electrons occupying the same lattice site. Let us assume we have precisely one such pair,

(3.B.21)

Here we used x + e Q(n) , x − e Q(n+1) ∈ D Q and x − e Q(n) , x + e Q(n+1) ∈ D Q in the
third equation and (x + e Q(n) )Q = xQ + en+1 , (x − e Q(n+1) )Q = xQ − en in the
fourth equation. In the seventh equation we used the uniqueness condition
(3.B.18).
From the right hand side of (3.B.21) we can read off a sufﬁcient condition for the
Schrödinger equation to be satisﬁed,

= − sin(k P(n) ) − sin(k P(n+1) ) A(kP|aQ) − A(kP|aQ) − 4iu A(kP|aQ) .
(3.B.22)
If a second pair of electrons occupies another lattice site, we get the same equation (3.B.22).
Thus, (3.B.18) and (3.B.22) are sufﬁcient for ψ(x; a|k) to be uniquely deﬁned and to satisfy
the Schrödinger equation for all x ∈ Z N .
Can we construct a set of amplitudes A(kP|aQ) that satisﬁes both equations, (3.B.18) and
(3.B.22)? In order to study this question we reformulate equations (3.B.18) and (3.B.22)
in a more convenient language. For ﬁxed kP the amplitude A(kP|aQ) is a function of
the N spin variables a j , which take on values a j = ↑, ↓ each. We may therefore interpret
A(kP|aQ) as representing the coordinates of a 2 N -dimensional vector. The corresponding
auxiliary vector space may be understood as the 2 N -dimensional space of states of an N -site
spin- 12 chain. Let us introduce the canonical
1 basis of this
0 vector space. It is constructed from
tensor products of basis vectors e↑ = 0 and e↓ = 1 . A basis vector may be written as
|a = ea1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ea N . These basis vectors are mutually orthonormal under the canonical
hermitian scalar product,
a|b = ea1 , eb1 . . . ea N , eb N = δba11 . . . δbaNN .

(3.B.23)

There is a natural action of the symmetric group on basis vectors in our spin chain Hilbert
space,
Q|a = |aQ −1 ,

(3.B.24)

which deﬁnes a representation of the symmetric group,
P(Q|a ) = P|aQ −1 = |(aQ −1 )P −1 = |a(P Q)−1 = (P Q)|a .

(3.B.25)

This representation is unitary: we have
a −1 (1)

a|Q + |b = aQ −1 |b = δb1Q

a −1 (N )

. . . δb NQ

N

= δbaQ(1)
. . . δbaQ(N

and thus Q + = Q −1 .

(3.B.26)

84

Appendices to Chapter 3

Let us deﬁne
|kP =



A(kP|b)|b .

(3.B.27)

b1 ,...,b N =↑,↓

Then it follows from (3.B.23) that
A(kP|aQ) = aQ|kP .

(3.B.28)

Using (3.B.28), (3.B.24), and (3.B.26), we can rewrite the uniqueness condition (3.B.18)
and the condition (3.B.22) arising from the Schrödinger equation in the language of the
spin problem. The uniqueness condition turns into
(1 + )|kP = (1 + )|kP .

(3.B.29)

Similarly, equation (3.B.22) is equivalent to
,
,
(s P(n) − s P(n+1) )(1 − ) − 4iu |kP = −(s P(n) − s P(n+1) )(1 − ) − 4iu |kP .
(3.B.30)
Here we have introduced the short hand notation sn = sin(kn ) which in the following will
prove to be convenient.
Equation (3.B.30) can be easily
solved for |kP . Since 2 = 1,
,
multiplication by −(s P(n) − s P(n+1) )(1 + ) − 4iu from the left gives
|kP = Yn,n+1 (s P(n) − s P(n+1) )|kP ,

(3.B.31)

where we introduced the operators
Y jk (λ) =

2iu + λ  jk
.
2iu + λ

(3.B.32)

Instead of (3.B.18) and (3.B.22) we can now deal with equations (3.B.29) and (3.B.31).
This innocent looking reformulation of the original equations has strong immediate consequences. It turns the remaining calculations into a beautiful piece of algebra based on the
properties of the so-called Y -operators (3.B.32) ﬁrst introduced by C. N. Yang in [493].
The ﬁrst implication that can be drawn from (3.B.29) and (3.B.31) is that (3.B.18) is
automatically satisﬁed for any set of amplitudes solving (3.B.22). This can be seen as
follows. We multiply equation (3.B.31), which is equivalent to (3.B.22), by 1 +  from
the left. Then, since (1 + ) = (1 + ), (3.B.31) turns into (3.B.29), which is equivalent
to (3.B.18). Hence, equation (3.B.22) is a sufﬁcient condition for the Bethe wave function
ψ(x; a|k), equation (3.B.19), to be uniquely deﬁned and to satisfy the Schrödinger equation.

3.B.3 Consistency
Our original problem of ﬁnding joint solutions of (3.B.18) and (3.B.22) has now reduced
to the problem of ﬁnding solutions of (3.B.22). At the same time the recursive structure of
(3.B.31) allows us to construct these solutions. We see from (3.B.22) that the Y -operators
(3.B.32) induce the action of the nearest neighbour transpositions  on the vectors k

3.B Derivation of Bethe ansatz wave functions

85

that label the states |k of the auxiliary spin problem. Since the symmetric group S N is
generated by the transpositions of nearest neighbours, all spin states |kP , P ∈ S N , can
be constructed from |k by repeated use of (3.B.31). Equivalently, (3.B.31) connects every
state |kP , P ∈ S N , with any other state |k P̃ , P̃ ∈ S N . It follows that all amplitudes
A(kP|a) = a|kP in the sector D id can be generated out of A(k|a). The amplitudes in the
other sectors are simply A(kP|aQ) = aQ|kP = a|Q|kP .
The remaining problem we have to face is that of the uniqueness of the amplitudes
constructed by iterative use of (3.B.31). This problem is known as the consistency problem.
It is due to the fact that a representation of a permutation P ∈ S N as a product of nearest
neighbour transpositions is not unique.
Let us consider the example N = 3. Then we have, for instance, the identity
12 23 12 = 23 12 23 = 13 .

(3.B.33)

There are thus two different ways to create A(k13 |a) out of A(k|a) by application of
Y -operators, equation (3.B.31),
A(k13 |a) = A(k12 23 12 |a) = A(k23 12 23 |a)
= a|Y12 (s2 − s3 )Y23 (s1 − s3 )Y12 (s1 − s2 )|k
= a|Y23 (s1 − s2 )Y12 (s1 − s3 )Y23 (s2 − s3 )|k .

(3.B.34)

For this equation to be true for arbitrary states |a and |k the triple products of Y -operators
on both sides of the third equation (3.B.34) must agree. It is crucial that this is indeed the
case. The Y -operators Y jk (λ) satisfy the so-called Yang-Baxter equation,
Y jk (λ)Ykl (λ + µ)Y jk (µ) = Ykl (µ)Y jk (λ + µ)Ykl (λ) ,

(3.B.35)

which can be proven rather easily by direct calculation (see appendix 3.C). It further follows
from the deﬁnition (3.B.32) of Y jk (λ) that
−1
Y jk
(λ) = Y jk (−λ) .

(3.B.36)

Using equations (3.B.35) and (3.B.36) we show in appendix 3.C that all amplitudes
A(kP|aQ) are uniquely deﬁned by (3.B.31) once the amplitude A(k|a) is given. This
is a situation typical for a scattering problem, where the amplitude of the incoming wave is
arbitrary and ﬁxes the amplitudes of the scattered and the reﬂected waves.

3.B.4 Periodic boundary conditions
So far we have solved the Schrödinger equation (3.16) regarded as a mere difference equation, not as an eigenvalue problem. In this subsection we shall impose the periodic boundary
conditions (3.17) on the Bethe ansatz wave functions. This will result in an eigenvalue problem for the amplitudes A(kP|aQ), which can be interpreted as an auxiliary spin problem.
The auxiliary spin problem is solved below in Section 3.B.5 by means of the algebraic
Bethe ansatz.

Appendices to Chapter 3

Let x ∈ {1, . . . , L} N . The condition (−j − −j,L )ψ(x, a|k) = 0 is trivially satisﬁed for
x j = 2, . . . , L. If x j = 1, then there is an element Q ∈ S N , such that x ∈ D Q and x j =
x Q(1) . In this case the periodic boundary conditions are non-trivial,
ψ(x − (1 − L)e Q(1) ; a|k) = ψ(x − e Q(1) ; a|k) .

(3.B.37)

Similarly, the condition (+j − +j,L )ψ(x, a|k) = 0 is trivial for x j = 1, . . . , L − 1. If x j =
L, then there is an element Q ∈ S N , such that x ∈ D Q and x j = x Q(N ) . We obtain the nontrivial condition
ψ(x + (1 − L)e Q(N ) ; a|k) = ψ(x + e Q(N ) ; a|k) .

(3.B.38)

Let us discuss equation (3.B.37). Let y = x − e Q(1) and z = y + Le Q(1) . Then y ∈ D Q ,
z Q(1) = y Q(1) + L and z Q( j) = y Q( j) , j = 2, . . . , N . It follows that z Q(2) ≤ · · · ≤ z Q(N ) ≤
z Q(1) , which may be equivalently stated as z QU N (1) ≤ · · · ≤ z QU N (N ) . Here
U N = 12 . . .  N −1,N

(3.B.39)

is the generator of the cyclic subgroup of order N of the symmetric group. We conclude
that
ψ(y + Le Q(1) ; a|k) = ψ(z; a|k)

Comparing (3.B.40) with the expression for ψ(y; a|k), we see that the condition
A(kPU N |aQU N ) = e−ik P(1) L A(kP|aQ)

(3.B.41)

is sufﬁcient for (3.B.37) to be satisﬁed.
A very similar reasoning can be applied to equation (3.B.38). Let y = x + e Q(N ) and z =
y − Le Q(N ) . Then y ∈ D Q , z Q(N ) = y Q(N ) − L and z Q( j) = y Q( j) for j = 1, . . . , N − 1.
It follows that z Q(N ) ≤ z Q(1) ≤ · · · ≤ z Q(N −1) , which is equivalent to z QU N−1 (1) ≤ · · · ≤
z QU N−1 (N ) . We thus obtain
ψ(y − Le Q(N ) ; a|k) = ψ(z; a|k)

Hence, a sufﬁcient condition for (3.B.38) to hold is
A(kP|aQ) = e−ik P(N ) L A(kPU N−1 |aQU N−1 ) .

(3.B.43)

3.B Derivation of Bethe ansatz wave functions

Let us set P̃ = PU N−1 , Q̃ = QU N−1 . Then (3.B.43) turns into
A(k P̃U N |a Q̃U N ) = e−ik P̃(1) L A(k P̃|a Q̃) ,

(3.B.44)

which is equivalent to (3.B.41). We are thus left with a single condition, namely (3.B.41),
that sufﬁces to guarantee periodicity of the wave functions (3.B.19).
Now (3.B.31) allows us to transform (3.B.41) into an eigenvalue problem. First of all we
obtain
A(kPU N |aQU N ) = aQU N |kPU N = aQ|U N |kPU N −1  N −1,N
= aQ|U N Y N −1,N (s PU N −1 (N −1) − s PU N −1 (N ) )|kPU N −1

= aQ|U N Y N −1,N (s P(1) − s P(N ) ) . . . Y1,2 (s P(1) − s P(2) )|kP

. . . · 1,2 Y1,2 (s P(1) − s P(2) )|kP
= e−ik P(1) L aQ|kP .

(3.B.45)

This suggests to deﬁne the operator
X jk (λ) =  jk Y jk (λ) .

(3.B.46)

It then follows from the last two lines of equation (3.B.45) that (3.B.41) is equivalent to the
eigenvalue problem
X 1,N (s P(1) − s P(N ) ) . . . X 1,2 (s P(1) − s P(2) )|kP = e−ik P(1) L |kP ,

(3.B.47)

which has to be solved for all P ∈ S N .
Remark. Applying (3.B.31) to the eigenvalue problem (3.B.47) it is not difﬁcult to see
that (3.B.47) is equivalent to
X j, j−1 (s P( j) − s P( j−1) ) . . . X j,1 (s P( j) − s P(1) )X j,N (s P( j) − s P(N ) )
. . . · X j, j+1 (s P( j) − s P( j+1) )|kP = e−ik P( j) L |kP

(3.B.48)

for j = 1, . . . , N , where we introduced the conventions X 1,0 (λ) = X 1,N (λ) and
X N ,N +1 (λ) = X N ,1 (λ).
Although the mutual compatibility of equations (3.B.48) for ﬁxed P and j = 1, . . . , N
is clear by construction, the reader may wonder what is the reason behind it. As before it
is again the Yang-Baxter equation. The Yang-Baxter equation for the operators X jk (λ) is
obtained from (3.B.35) by multiplication with  jk  jl kl = kl  jl  jk from the right,
X jk (λ)X jl (λ + µ)X kl (µ) = X kl (µ)X jl (λ + µ)X jk (λ) .

(3.B.49)

Instead of applying (3.B.49) and the inversion relation X jk (λ)X jk (−λ) = id directly to
(3.B.48), which is one possible way of proving the compatibility of the equations (3.B.48)

88

Appendices to Chapter 3

for j = 1, . . . , N , we shall postpone a direct proof until the next section where we derive
a more appropriate formulation of (3.B.48).

3.B.5 Algebraic solution of the spin problem
We shall now identify the eigenvalue problem (3.B.48) as an eigenvalue problem for the
transfer matrix of an inhomogeneous XXX spin chain and then solve it by means of the
algebraic Bethe ansatz. For more information about the general method the reader is referred
to Chapter 12. Here we only give a brief but self-contained account of the aspects needed
to solve our concrete problem.
Let us ﬁrst express the transpositions  jk in terms of spin operators,
 jk = 12 (id + σ jα σkα ) .

(3.B.50)

Here we introduced the usual embedding of Pauli matrices into the space of endomorphisms
on the space of states,
⊗( j−1)

σ jα = I2

⊗(N − j)

⊗ σ α ⊗ I2

,

(3.B.51)

j = 1, . . . , N . In our notation I2 is the 2 × 2 unit matrix.
Next, we shall need extensions of our spin chain Hilbert space by one or two sites,
respectively. We will indicate this by supplying superscripts (a) or (ab) to the operators and
call these additional sites auxiliary spaces. Then we can deﬁne
(a)
T (λ|kP) = X a(a)N (λ − iu − s P(N ) ) . . . X a1
(λ − iu − s P(1) ) ,

(3.B.52)

with the subscript a referring to the auxiliary space. It follows that
(a)
(a)
T (s P(1) + iu|kP) = X a(a)N (s P(1) − s P(N ) ) . . . X a2
(s P(1) − s P(2) )X a1

(3.B.53)
(a)
Here we used the fact that X a1
(0) = a1 in the second equation. Taking the trace in auxiliary
space we obtain


tr T (s P(1) + iu|kP) = X 1N (s P(1) − s P(N ) ) . . . X 12 (s P(1) − s P(2) ) .
(3.B.54)

With the abbreviation
t(λ|kP) = tr(T (λ|kP))

(3.B.55)

equation (3.B.47) is an eigenvalue problem for the operator t(s P(1) + iu|kP). The operator
t(λ|kP) may be interpreted as the transfer matrix of an inhomogeneous XXX spin chain,
T (λ|kP) as the corresponding monodromy matrix (see Chapter 12).
Let us now identify the standard objects of the algebraic Bethe ansatz, namely the Rmatrix and the L-matrix. For this purpose we shall write our operators as matrices with

Ř(λ − µ) L n (λ) ⊗ L n (µ) = L n (µ) ⊗ L n (λ) Ř(λ − µ) .

(3.B.60)

(3.B.61)

Furthermore, the monodromy matrix (3.B.52) can be written as
T (λ|kP) = L N (λ − s P(N ) ) · · · · · L 1 (λ − s P(1) ) ,

(3.B.62)

and, using the fact that the entries of L-matrices with different site indices mutually commute, we can iterate (3.B.61) to obtain

 

Ř(λ − µ) T (λ|kP) ⊗ T (µ|kP) = T (µ|kP) ⊗ T (λ|kP) Ř(λ − µ) .
(3.B.63)

Appendices to Chapter 3

This is a set of quadratic commutation relation between the matrix elements of the monodromy matrix T (λ|kP). We will later say (see Chapter 12) that T (λ|kP) is a representation
of the Yang-Baxter algebra with R-matrix Ř(λ). (3.B.63) will be the central tool in the
following calculations.
Remark. Multiplying (3.B.63) by Ř −1 (λ − µ) from the right and taking the trace in the
tensor product of auxiliary spaces, we obtain
[t(λ|kP), t(µ|kP)] = 0 .

(3.B.64)

t(λ|kP) is a commutating family of transfer matrices. This observation is the starting point
for a simple proof of the compatibility of the equations (3.B.48): Let us slightly generalize
the deﬁnition (3.B.52),
(a)
T ( j) (λ|kP) = X a(a)j−1 (λ − iu − s P( j−1) ) . . . X a1
(λ − iu − s P(1) )

×X a(a)N (λ − iu − s P(n) ) . . . X a(a)j (λ − iu − s P( j) ) ,

(3.B.65)

for j = 1, . . . , N . Repeating the steps in (3.B.53) and (3.B.54) we conclude that


tr T ( j) (s P( j) + iu|kP) = X j, j−1 (s P( j) − s P( j−1) ) . . . X j1 (s P( j) − s P(1) )
×X j N (s P( j) − s P(N ) ) . . . X j, j+1 (s P( j) − s P( j+1) ) . (3.B.66)
On the other hand,
T ( j) (λ|kP) = L j−1 (λ − s P( j−1) ) . . . L 1 (λ − s P(1) )L N (λ − s P(N ) ) . . . L j (λ − s P( j) ) .
(3.B.67)
Taking the trace of (3.B.67) and using the cyclic invariance of the trace for a product of
matrices with mutually commuting entries we arrive at the conclusion that




By (3.B.68) and (3.B.66) we identify the products of operators on the left hand side of
(3.B.48) with t(s P( j) + iu|kP). Then the compatibility of the equations (3.B.48) follows

The functions F j (λ) and F̃ j (λ) will be determined below. Equations (3.B.76) and (3.B.77)
follow from (3.B.70)-(3.B.72) and (3.B.74). Consider, for instance, (3.B.71). When moving
A past B two terms are generated, the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (3.B.71), where
A and B keep their arguments, and the second term, where the arguments are interchanged.
When moving A through a product of B’s, there is precisely one term where all B’s keep
their arguments. It is resulting from repeated use of the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of
(3.B.71) and gives the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (3.B.76). All other possibilities
are exhausted by replacing one of the arguments in the product of B’s, say λ j , by λ, and
we therefore have the second term on the right-hand side of (3.B.76).
Let us calculate F1 (λ). When moving A through the product of B’s, we ﬁrst apply the
second term on the right hand side of (3.B.71) and then repeatedly apply the ﬁrst term. This

gives all terms proportional to B(λ) k=2

3.C Some technical details
This appendix contains some technical details which were left out in the derivation of the
Bethe ansatz wave function in appendix 3.B.

3.C.1 Yang-Baxter equation
We show that Y jk (λ) satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation (3.B.35). Because of the homogeneity of the Yang-Baxter equation we may replace Y jk (λ) by Ỹ jk (λ) = 1 + λ jk . For
simplicity we may further set j = 1, k = 2, l = 3 in (3.B.35). Then
(1 + λ12 )(1 + (λ + µ)23 )(1 + µ12 ) − (1 + µ23 )(1 + (λ + µ)12 )(1 + λ23 )
= µ(λ + µ)(23 12 − 23 12 ) + λ(λ + µ)(12 23 − 12 23 )
+ λµ(12 12 − 23 23 ) + λµ(λ + µ)(12 23 12 − 23 12 23 )
= 0,

(3.C.1)

where we have used (3.B.33) and the identity  jk  jk = 1. Equation (3.C.1) is equivalent
to (3.B.35).

3.C.2 The consistency problem
In order to show the consistency of the equations (3.B.31) we have to recall an abstract
deﬁnition of the symmetric group. The symmetric group S N is generated by the identity
id and the transpositions of nearest neighbours n,n+1 , n = 1, . . . , N − 1, modulo the
relations
n,n+1 n+1,n+2 n,n+1 = n+1,n+2 n,n+1 n+1,n+2 ,
n,n+1 m,m+1 = m,m+1 n,n+1
n,n+1 n,n+1 = id .

for |n − m| > 1 ,

(3.C.2a)
(3.C.2b)
(3.C.2c)

Equation (3.C.2a) is called the braid relation. Note that (3.C.2b) is applicable only for
N > 3.

3.C Some technical details

95

Due to (3.C.2a)–(3.C.2c) a representation of a permutation as a product of transpositions
of nearest neighbours is not unique. Therefore the use of equations (3.C.2a)–(3.C.2c) in
(3.B.31) imposes certain consistency conditions on the Y -operators.
Let us consider the braid relation. Suppose P ∈ S N contains a string of the form
n,n+1 n+1,n+2 n,n+1 , i.e., P = Qn,n+1 n+1,n+2 n,n+1 R with Q, R ∈ S N . Then, on
the one hand,
|kP = . . . |kQn,n+1 n+1,n+2 n,n+1
= . . . Yn,n+1 (s Qn,n+1 n+1,n+2 (n) − s Qn,n+1 n+1,n+2 (n+1) )
× Yn+1,n+2 (s Qn,n+1 (n+1) − s Qn,n+1 (n+2) ) · Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )|kQ
= . . . Yn,n+1 (s Q(n+1) − s Q(n+2) )Yn+1,n+2 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+2) )
× Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )|kQ ,

(3.C.3)

where the dots denote the string of Y -operators which induces the action of the permutation
R. On the other hand,
|kP = . . . |kQn+1,n+2 n,n+1 n+1,n+2
= . . . Yn+1,n+2 (s Qn+1,n+2 n,n+1 (n+1) − s Qn+1,n+2 n,n+1 (n+2) )
× Yn,n+1 (s Qn+1,n+2 (n) − s Qn+1,n+2 (n+1) ) · Yn+1,n+2 (s Q(n+1) − s Q(n+2) )|kQ
= . . . Yn+1,n+2 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+2) )
× Yn+1,n+2 (s Q(n+1) − s Q(n+2) )|kQ .

(3.C.4)

Now for the Bethe ansatz to be consistent the expressions for |kP in equation (3.C.3) and
(3.C.4) have to agree for arbitrary k. This is the case, if and only if
Yn,n+1 (s Q(n+1) − s Q(n+2) )Yn+1,n+2 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+2) )Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )
= Yn+1,n+2 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+2) )Yn+1,n+2 (s Q(n+1) − s Q(n+2) ) ,
(3.C.5)
which is nothing but the Yang-Baxter equation (3.B.35) proven in appendix A.
Similarly, equation (3.C.2b) leads to the consistency condition
Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )Ym,m+1 (s Q(m) − s Q(m+1) )
= Ym,m+1 (s Q(m) − s Q(m+1) )Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )

for |n − m| > 1 . (3.C.6)

This condition is trivial.
From the last equation, (3.C.2c), we obtain
Yn,n+1 (s Q(n) − s Q(n+1) )Yn,n+1 (s Q(n+1) − s Q(n) ) = 1 ,
which is always true as a consequence of equation (3.B.36).

Appendices to Chapter 3

3.D Highest weight property of the Bethe ansatz states with respect to total spin
We give a proof of the highest weight theorem presented in Section 3.4. The proof is based
on the fact that the action of the spin operators S ± and S z on the Bethe ansatz states reduces
to an action of associated spin operators on the eigenstates |kP, λ of the inhomogeneous
transfer matrix t(λ|kP). The highest weight theorem then follows from the su(2) invariance
of t(λ|kP).

3.D.1 Spin operators in fermionic and in spin chain representation
Let us introduce some more notation for spin chains. When dealing with spin chains it
is often useful to switch from the local basis {σ x , σ y , σ z , I2 } to the canonical gl(2) basis

Appendices to Chapter 3


Here we have used bQ| = b|Q (see Section 3.B.2) and b∈Z2N |b b| = id in the second
equation and [As , Q] = 0 in the third equation. Equations (3.D.13) and (3.D.14) show how
A f induces the action of As on the spin part of the Bethe ansatz wave functions.
N †
Let us consider the simplest example. For A = I2 we have A f = n=1
cn,a cn,a = N̂ and
s
A = N · id. Thus, (3.D.13) and (3.D.14) imply that
N̂ |ψk,λλ = N |ψk,λλ ,

(3.D.15)

which shows nothing but the fact that the Bethe ansatz states are N -particle states.
In the next section we shall consider the action of spin operators on Bethe ansatz
states.

3.D.3 su(2) invariance of the spin problem
In the previous section we have shown that the action of Fermi operators A f of the form
(3.D.10) induces an action of associated spin operators As , equation (3.D.6), on the spin
states |kP, λ that determine the amplitudes aQ|kP, λ in the Bethe ansatz wave functions.
Here we consider the cases A = σ α , α = x, y, z, i.e., A f = 2S α . The corresponding spin
operators on the spin chain space of states are

These operators generate a representation of the Lie algebra su(2),
[ α ,  β ] = 2iε αβγ  γ .

(3.D.17)

The ladder operators in this representation are
 ± =  x ± i y .

(3.D.18)

They correspond to A = σ ± , A f = 2S ± .
We are now going to prove that the eigenstates |kP, λ of the transfer matrix t(λ|kP)
(see equation (3.B.55)) are su(2) highest weight states with highest weight N − 2M. This
means that
 + |kP, λ = 0

(3.D.19)

 z |kP, λ = (N − 2M)|kP, λ ,

(3.D.20)

and

if the Bethe ansatz equations (3.B.83) are satisﬁed. We shall further show that the transfer
matrix t(λ|kP) commutes with the su(2) generators,
[ ± , t(λ|kP)] = [ z , t(λ|kP)] = 0 .

(3.D.21)

3.D Highest weight property of the Bethe ansatz states

99

Equations (3.D.19), (3.D.20) and (3.D.21) follow from the ‘su(2) invariance’ of the
monodromy matrix T (λ|kP), which can be stated as follows:
[T (λ|kP), σ α +  α ] = 0 ,

(3.D.22)

for α = x, y, z. Here the σ α are 2 × 2-matrices in auxiliary space, and the  α are spin
operators in the spin chain space of states, i.e., they act in the same space as the matrix
elements of T (λ|kP).
We ﬁrst prove the basic formula (3.D.22) and show afterwards how (3.D.19)–(3.D.21)
follow. Equation (3.D.22) is a consequence of a similar statement for the L-operators (see
(3.B.60)), L n (λ) = c(2λ) + b(2λ)σ α σnα . On the one hand we have
[L n (λ), σnα ] = −b(2λ)σ β [σnα , σnβ ] = −b(2λ)2iε αβγ σ β σnγ ,

(3.D.23)

on the other hand
[L n (λ), σ α ] = −b(2λ)σnβ [σ α , σ β ] = −b(2λ)2iε αβγ σnβ σ γ = b(2λ)2iε αβγ σ β σnγ . (3.D.24)
Thus, adding the latter two equations,
[L n (λ), σ α + σnα ] = 0 .

[ α , J β (λ)] = 2iε αβγ J γ (λ) ,

(3.D.29)

which means they transform like a vector representation of su(2).
Let us proceed with the proof of (3.D.19) and (3.D.20). Equation (3.D.20) is easier to
prove than (3.D.19). It follows from (3.D.28b) and from  z |0 = N |0 ,

Note that this equation is valid, even if the Bethe ansatz equations (3.B.83) are not satisﬁed.
By way of contrast, the Bethe ansatz equations are needed to prove (3.D.19). First of all,

For the evaluation of the expression on the right hand side of this equation we use the
commutation relations (3.B.71), (3.B.72) between B(λ) and A(µ), D(µ). Our arguments
are similar to the arguments used in the derivation of the second level Bethe ansatz equations
(3.B.83) in appendix 3.B.5: When commuting A(λn ) and D(λn ) successively to the right
in equation (3.D.31), two terms are generated in every step, one term, in which A and D
keep their arguments, and another term in which A and D interchange their arguments with
B. Therefore, taking into account that A(λ)|0 = |0 and D(λ)|0 = d(λ)|0 (see appendix
3.B.5), the right-hand side of (3.D.31) must be equal to a sum over products of M − 1
operators B(λ) acting on the ferromagnetic state,

(3.B.83) are satisﬁed, and our proof of (3.D.19) is complete. Alternatively, (3.D.19) can be
proven by induction over M, which we suggest as an exercise to the reader.
Let us discuss the implications of (3.D.19)–(3.D.21). The spin states |kP, λ are highest
weight states with respect to the total spin, which is conserved by the transfer matrix
t(λ|kP). Since the value N − 2M of the total spin must be positive, we must have M ≤
N /2. Furthermore, because of (3.D.21), all states ( − )n |kP, λ , n = 1, . . . , N − 2M, are
eigenstates of t(λ|kP) with the common eigenvalue (λ) (see (3.B.84)).
Because of (3.D.11) and (3.D.14) similar statements are true for the Bethe ansatz eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. First of all, we must have M ≤ N /2. Equations (3.D.19),
(3.D.20) in conjunction with (3.D.11) and (3.D.14) imply that the Bethe ansatz eigenstates
of the Hubbard Hamiltonian are highest weight with respect to the spin representation S α ,
α = x, y, z, of su(2), i.e., we have
S + |ψk,λλ = 0 ,

(3.D.36)

S z |ψk,λλ = 12 (N − 2M)|ψk,λλ .

(3.D.37)

Therefore, the states

for the η-representation of su(2) will play an important role, when we count the number of
Bethe ansatz states in Chapter 4.

This representation is very convenient for many purposes. It is used, for instance, in

(3.E.7)

In our proof we shall resort to a formidable formula for the ‘iteration of the comultiplication’ which was obtained in [214, 215]. In order to explain this formula it is
helpful to consider a simple special case ﬁrst. Let us construct an abstract ‘two-site model’
by dividing the product of L-operators in the deﬁnition (3.B.62) of the monodromy matrix
into two parts,
T1 (λ|kP) = L n (λ − s P(n) ) . . . L 1 (λ − s P(1) ) ,

(3.E.8)

T2 (λ|kP) = L N (λ − s P(N ) ) . . . L n+1 (λ − s P(n+1) ) .

(3.E.9)

T (λ|kP) = T2 (λ|kP)T1 (λ|kP) .

was obtained in [215]. Note that it is valid in the more general context of the so-called
generalized model (see e.g. [270]). It can be proven by induction over k.
We now consider the particular case k = N , where N is the length of the spin chain.
Then each factor Tα (λ|kP), α = 1, . . . , N , must be identiﬁed with an individual L-operator
L α (λ − s P(α) ). From the deﬁnition (3.B.60) of the L-operators we obtain

This appendix contains a proof of equation (3.101): we show that for any even
lattice length L all Bethe ansatz states |ψk,λλ , equation (3.89), are annihilated by
the operator η− . We present a simpliﬁed version of the argument originally given
in [125].
The operator η− reduces the particle number by two (see equation (2.87)). The result
of acting with η− on any N -particle state |ψ N is therefore an (N − 2)-particle state. The

equivalent to the following
Lemma 1. For even length of the lattice L every Bethe ansatz wave function ψ(x; a|k; λ ),

Remark. Let us emphasize that we consider only ﬁnite charge momenta and ﬁnite spin
rapidities, i.e., k j , λ are supposed to take values in C and not on the Riemann sphere.
The corresponding solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations with 2M ≤ N ≤ L will be termed
regular as in [125].
The proof of lemma 1 will be divided into two essential steps. In step one the summation
over x N −1 and x N is carried out. Using the evenness of L and the fact that k and λ satisfy the
Lieb-Wu equations we shall see that the validity of the lemma depends on a simple identity
for the spin part aQ|kP, λ of the Bethe ansatz wave function (3.91)–(3.94). The second
essential step in the proof is then to establish this identity.
Step 1. We denote the sum on the left-hand side of (3.F.2) by S. The ﬁrst problem when
we calculate S, and for this purpose sum expressions involving the Bethe ansatz wave

exists, such that Q 1 (1) = N − 1, Q 1 (2) = N and x Q 1 (3) ≤ · · · ≤ x Q 1 (N ) . When x runs from
1 to L, then Q runs through N − 1 different permutations characterized by x lying between
two successive values x Q 1 ( j) and x Q 1 ( j+1) , j = 3, . . . , N − 1, or lying below x Q 1 (3) or above

the convention that sets I1 of ‘zero length’ (x Q 1 (3) = 1) are empty. The number of elements

we have to replace the second term by (−ei(k P(1) +k P(2) ) ) L+1 . It is exactly these two boundary

We have thus reduced the proof of lemma 1 to the veriﬁcation of the invariance equation
(3.F.16), which is a straightforward but slightly cumbersome matter and can be done by
resorting to the explicit form (3.91)–(3.94) of the spin part of the Bethe ansatz wave function.
More precisely, we shall only need the explicit form of the functions Fk (λ, y), equation

(3.93). The amplitudes A(λ
we only need that they satisfy the recurrence relation

The matrix 12 (1 − −1, ) is the antisymmetrization operator in the indices  − 1 and
. Hence, B (P) is zero for a Q 1 U2 (−1) = a Q 1 (1) = a N −1 = a Q 1 U2 () = a Q 1 (2) = a N and
changes sign if we interchange a N −1 and a N . We may therefore choose a N −1 =↓ and
a N =↑ for the remaining part of the proof. The sequence of ‘down spin coordinates’ ym() ,
m = 1, . . . , M, is the same for aQ 1 U2 | and aQ 1 U2 −1, | = aQ 1 U2 |−1, with precisely one exception, say ym() , which is  − 1 for aQ 1 U2 | and  for aQ 1 U2 |−1, . Using
this in the explicit form (3.91)–(3.94) of the spin part of the Bethe ansatz wave function

We have now rewritten B (P) in such a way that the ﬁrst three factors under the sum on the

factor, λ R(m  ) − s P() − iu, is clearly not invariant. How about the factors FkPU2 (λ R(m) , ym() )?
The answer depends on the value of ym() : it is easy to see that

two cases by looking at the relevant pieces of the sequences of spins a Q −1 (n) and a Q −2 (n)

The second and the third term on the right-hand side have now the required symmetry, but
the ﬁrst term has not. We observe, however, that the three factors in square brackets on the
right-hand side of equation (3.F.23) are not only symmetric in k P(1) , k P(2) and k P() but also

λ Rm  −1,m  ) is given by equation (3.F.18). We can thus
in λ R(m  −1) and λ R(m  ) , while A(λ
use our usual trick of decomposing the symmetric group as S M = A M ∪ A M m  −1,m  and
reducing the sum in (3.F.23) to a sum over A M . This way the ﬁrst term on the right-hand
side of equation (3.F.24) gets reduced to
−4iu(λ R(m  ) − λ R(m  −1) )(λ R(m  ) − λ R(m  −1) − 2iu) .
Since this expression is independent of k at all, we have ﬁnally succeeded in showing
that B (P) − B−1 (P) is symmetric in k P(1) , k P(2) and k P() , and the proof of lemma 1 is
complete.

3.G Limiting cases of the Bethe ansatz solution
The Bethe ansatz solution of the Hubbard model has several interesting limiting cases. In
appendices 2.A and 2.B we considered the strong coupling limits and the continuum limit
of the Hamiltonian. Here we discuss the same limits within the context of the Bethe ansatz
solution. The strong coupling limits will lead us to the Bethe ansatz solutions of the t-0
model and of the isotropic Heisenberg chain. We will also see how the Bethe ansatz can be
used to obtain the spectrum of the t-J Hamiltonian (2.A.33). In addition we shall brieﬂy
touch upon the limit of weak coupling in which we shall ‘discover’ the so-called Gaudin
model [156].

3.G.1 Strong coupling limits
Formally the limit u → ∞ is easily performed in the Bethe ansatz wave function and in
the Lieb-Wu equations. We just have to observe that the scale of the spin rapidities is at our
disposal. Hence we may deﬁne u = λ and then take the limit in (3.95) and (3.96). We
immediately obtain the following equations,

(3.G.2)

We see that the equations for the charge momenta and spin rapidities decouple. The functions
sin(k j ) which appeared as inhomogeneities in the auxiliary spin problem have all vanished
from the equations. Equations (3.G.2) are the Bethe ansatz equations of the XXX Heisenberg
chain [60] (see Chapter 12.1.7). The expression on the right-hand side of (3.G.1) is the
eigenvalue of the shift operator for the spin chain. We therefore write

where Ps denotes the corresponding momentum eigenvalue. It may take values Ps =
m2π/N , m = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1 as can, for instance, be seen by multiplying (3.G.2) over
all  = 1, . . . , M. It follows that equations (3.G.1) have the solutions

What is the interpretation of these results? In order to answer this question let us ﬁrst
count the number of independent wave functions (3.G.6). For each ﬁxed number N of
electrons
there are 2 N linearly independent wave functions (3.G.7) of the spin system1 and

N =0 N 2 = 3 wave functions of the form (3.G.6). 3 is the dimension of the space
of states of the various t-J Hamiltonians of appendix 2.A which is the space of electronic
states with double occupancy of sites excluded. This observation ﬁts together well with
the fact that, because of the Slater determinant factor, the wave functions ψ∞ in equation
(3.G.6) vanish if any two coordinates, x j , xk , j = k, coincide.
In fact, the wave functions ψ∞ give a set of eigenfunctions of the t-0 Hamiltonian (2.A.40)
which becomes complete when supplemented with the su(2) symmetry of the spin system.
This can be veriﬁed by using the right-hand side of (3.G.6) as an ansatz wave function
in the eigenvalue problem of the t-0 Hamiltonian. One can proceed in much the same
way as in the nested Bethe ansatz calculation for the Hubbard model in appendix 3.B.
1

To obtain this number we also have to take into account the su(2) symmetry of the spin system (see Section 3.D).

114

Appendices to Chapter 3

It turns out that the ‘spin problem’ of diagonalizing the operator t(s P(1) − iu|kP) =
X 1,n (s P(1) − s P(N ) ) . . . X 1,2 (s P(1) − s P(2) ) on the left hand side of (3.B.47) gets replaced
with the eigenvalue problem for the shift operator Û = 1,2 . . .  N −1,N which is obtained
from t(s P(1) − iu|kP) for u → ∞.2 The shift operator Û is diagonal in the basis of Bethe
ansatz states of the XXX Hamiltonian. Hence, we obtain the Bethe ansatz solution (3.G.1),
(3.G.2), (3.G.6) of the t-0 model.
Of course, the shift operator is highly degenerate and is diagonal in other bases. A particularly convenient choice is the basis of eigenstates of the XX chain (see e.g. Section 12.2.1)
λ
which is equivalent to a system of free spinless fermions. In this basis the spin part aQ|λ
of the wave function ψ∞ also assumes a determinantal form and the set (3.G.2) of Bethe
ansatz equations for the spin problem gets replaced by
eiq N = (−1) M+1 ,

 = 1, . . . , M

(3.G.8)

(see [179,219]). In these variables the momentum of the spin system entering the right-hand
M
side of (3.G.1) through (3.G.3) is Ps = =1
q . The use of the XX chain eigenfunctions
instead of the more complicated XXX chain eigenfunctions made is possible to study
dynamical correlations of the t-0 model in [219].
However, if one is interested in the large u limit of the Hubbard model rather than in
the highly degenerate t-0 model it is preferable to stick with the XXX chain wavefunctions
for the spin part of ψ∞ , because ψ∞ then includes the u → ∞ limit of the ground state
of the Hubbard model (which becomes unique for inﬁnitesimal positive 1/u). Ogata and
Shiba identiﬁed this limit state and used it to study the ground state one-point Green
functions and spin-spin correlation function of the Hubbard model in the strong coupling
limit numerically [344] (see also [345]). They showed [344] that the limit state gives the
ground-state energy correctly to the order 1/u (rather than 1).
It is, of course, possible to expand the whole Bethe ansatz solution of the Hubbard model
systematically in 1/u. To give an example of how this works let us calculate the leading
1/u corrections to the energy eigenvalues. They turn out to be fairly simple.
We assume we are given a solution of the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96) having an
asymptotic expansion of the form

This observation may lead us to the interpretation of t(s P(1) − iu|kP) as a shift operator for the inhomogeneous system. The

Comparing with the results of appendix 2.A, in particular with the expression (2.A.37), we

given by (3.G.16), where the spin rapidities satisfy the Bethe ansatz equations (3.G.2).
3.G.2 Continuum limit and Bethe ansatz solution of the model of electrons
with delta-function interaction
In appendix 2.B we showed that the Hubbard model can be viewed as a lattice regularization
of the continuum model of electrons with mutual delta-function interaction. The Heisenberg
equation of motion for the ﬁeld operators of this model is called the non-linear Schrödinger
equation. The corresponding Hamiltonian is

Appendices to Chapter 3

In appendix 2.B we obtained this Hamiltonian from the Hubbard Hamiltonian by an appropriate rescaling of the ﬁelds and variables. We introduced a lattice constant a0 and
considered it to be small. Discrete space variables n were rescaled as x = a0 n and momenta
on the lattice k as q = k/a0 . The total length  of the continuum model is therefore related
to the number of lattice sites L as  = a0 L. We further found out that we have to rescale the
Hubbard coupling u as c = u/a0 . Let us also introduce rescaled spin rapidities µ = λ/a0 ,
insert the new variables into the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96) and perform the limit
a0 → 0. We obtain

With no further effort one also obtains the eigenfunctions of the NLS Hamiltonian from

the functions sin k j get replaced by q j . In particular, the form of the wavefunctions in the

The variables y are again coordinates of down spins on electrons. Their values depend on
a and Q.
The above results were ﬁrst obtained by M. Gaudin [154] and C. N. Yang [493] by
directly applying the ideas of the nested Bethe ansatz as described in appendix 3.B to the
Hamiltonian (3.G.17). Here we obtained them as an extra bonus out of the Bethe ansatz
solution of the Hubbard model. Starting from the Bethe ansatz equations (3.G.18), (3.G.19)
and the expression (3.G.20) we could develop the theory of the one-dimensional electron
gas with delta-function interaction in much the same way as we develop the theory of the
one-dimensional Hubbard model in the following chapters of this book.
Let us conclude our digression on the NLS Hamiltonian with the ‘derivation’ of a
conjecture for the norm of the eigenfunctions which cannot be found in the literature.
We ﬁrst observe (see (2.B.5)) that the continuum analogue of the Wannier states is

The determinant in (3.G.27) may again be interpreted as the Hessian determinant of a

3.G.3 Weak coupling limit
For u → 0 the Hubbard Hamiltonian (2.31) turns into the tight-binding Hamiltonian H0
(equation (2.12) with t = 1) which describes free electrons on the lattice (see (2.20)). What
happens to the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96) and to the Bethe ansatz wave function
(3.91) in this limit?
The charge momenta k j stay ﬁnite in the free electron limit. It follows that the function
Fk (λ; y), equation (3.93), vanishes and therefore also the spin part aQ|kP, λ of the Bethe
ansatz wave function. In order to obtain a non-vanishing weak-coupling limit we change
the normalization and ﬁrst multiply the Bethe ansatz wave function by (2iu)−M . Then it
follows that

Equation (3.G.33a) determines the spectrum to be free fermionic. Equations (3.G.33b), on
the other hand, are the Bethe ansatz equations of the inhomogeneous Gaudin model. Here
they determine the spin part (3.G.32) of the Bethe ansatz wave functions of the Hubbard
model for vanishing coupling u → 0.
Our above results indicate that the u → 0 limit of the Bethe ansatz solution of the
Hubbard model is rather non-trivial. The Bethe ansatz equations (3.G.33) decouple, but the
wave functions do not turn into Slater determinants, as one might have expected for free
electrons. They rather involve the eigenfunctions of an anisotropic Gaudin model as the
spin parts of wave functions which are still of Bethe ansatz form. This appears less puzzling

if one considers the large degeneracy of a system of free fermions which makes it possible
to construct more than one basis of eigenfunctions.
Further aspects of the limit u → 0 that were discussed in the literature and that will be
taken up in later chapters are the behaviour of the ground-state energy [113, 326, 431] (see
Chapter 6) and of the elementary excitations [142].

In the following we will concentrate on regular solutions of these equations as deﬁned
in Section 3.3.2. Physical quantities like energy and momentum are expressed directly
in terms of the roots of the Lieb-Wu equations, which we also call spectral parameters.
These roots are in general complex numbers. The problem we are faced with now is that
there is no simple analytical or numerical method for solving a large number of coupled,
nonlinear, algebraic equations. As long as the number of roots is small, say four or ﬁve,
one may determine all solutions by numerical means (see for example Ref. [95]). However,
we are ultimately interested in the thermodynamic limit and therefore need another way of
analyzing the Lieb-Wu equations. It turns out that for very large lengths L of the lattice
most of the roots of (4.1) arrange themselves in regular patterns in the complex plane. These
patterns are called ‘strings’. We will describe shortly how to ﬁnd these patterns. If one makes
the assumption that all roots of (4.1) form strings one can turn (4.1) into a set of equations
involving only the real parts of the roots. This procedure is known as the ‘string hypothesis’
and was ﬁrst introduced for the case of the spin- 12 Heisenberg model by H. Bethe in [60],
see also [433]. Finally, the resulting equations are turned into a set of coupled integral
equations, which can be solved analytically in various limits. This approach is the standard
way of analyzing Bethe ansatz equations in integrable models and is believed to give exact
results in the thermodynamic limit.
For ﬁnite systems one may easily establish that the string hypothesis is not strictly
correct. While most of the roots indeed arrange themselves into strings, there sometimes
are signiﬁcant deviations from the ideal patterns and there also are solutions that cannot
be described in the framework of the string hypothesis. An instructive illustration of these
120

4.1 String conﬁgurations

121

issues for the case of the spin- 12 Heisenberg chain can be found in Refs. [28, 29, 46, 79, 94,
124, 151, 208, 228, 328, 343]. A crucial point is that as far as the isotropic Heisenberg chain
and the Hubbard model are concerned, the string hypothesis appears to give exact results
for thermodynamic quantities like the (free) energy per site, dispersions of excited states in
the inﬁnite volume, or dressed scattering matrices as long as we consider only situations in
which we have ﬁnite densities of Bethe roots in the inﬁnite volume limit. However, even
in these cases the string hypothesis is not free of problems as was shown for the Heisenberg
chain in Refs. [30, 483, 484]. In the thermodynamic limit at ﬁnite temperatures the validity
of the string hypothesis was demonstrated by A. M. Tsvelik and P. B. Wiegmann in [460].
Violations of the string hypothesis can be quite important if we are interested in the
corrections to the energies in a large but ﬁnite volume. These ﬁnite-size corrections are very
important as it is possible to determine the large-distance asymptotics of correlation functions from them (see Chapter 8). In integrable models like the integrable spin-S TakhtajanBabujian model [31,444], where the zero-temperature ground state involves string solutions,
it is necessary to take into account (small) deviations from the string hypothesis in the ﬁnite
volume in order to obtain the correct ﬁnite-size corrections to energy levels [16, 145, 146].
For the Hubbard model this particular type of complication is absent.
4.1 String conﬁgurations
Let us now discuss how to ﬁnd the particular patterns into which the roots of the Lieb-Wu
equations arrange themselves. The basic idea is very simple: take L large and then make one
of the spectral parameters complex. The left-hand side of the equation for that particular
spectral parameter will then be exponentially large and this implies that we must be very
close to a pole in one of the factors on the right-hand side of the equations.
4.1.1 k-Λ strings
Let us look at a speciﬁc example, namely N = 2, M = 1, corresponding to a state with one
spin-up and one spin-down electron. We denote the corresponding spectral parameters by
k1 , k2 and  . Let us now take
k1 = q − iξ ,

(4.2)

where q, ξ are real and ξ > 0. The Lieb-Wu equations are
 − sin(k1 ) − iu

 − sin(k1 ) + iu

As ξ > 0 the left hand side of equation (4.3) is exponentially large (∝ exp(ξ L)) for large
L. The only way to fulﬁl (4.3) is for the r.h.s. to be exponentially close to a pole, i.e. k1

must be related to  by
 = sin(k1 ) − iu + O(e−ξ L ).

(4.6)

However, this implies that the ﬁrst factor on the right hand side of (4.5) is exponentially
large, which in turn forces the second factor to be very close to zero. This ﬁxes k2 to be
sin(k2 ) =  − iu + O(e−ξ L ).

(4.7)

We may replace the Lieb-Wu equations (4.3) and (4.4) with exponential accuracy by (4.6)
and (4.7). The remaining Lieb-Wu equation (4.5) then determines  . Putting everything
together (and taking care of the fact that ξ > 0) we have found a ‘k- string’ solution of
the form
k1 = π − arcsin( + iu) + O(e−δL ) ,
k2 = π − arcsin( − iu) + O(e−δL ) ,


real,

(4.8)

where δ is some constant and the branch of arcsin(x) is ﬁxed as −π/2 ≤ Re(arcsin(x)) ≤
π/2. Why do we call this pattern a string? In order to see this, let us consider the quantities
sin(k1,2 ) rather than k1,2 . As is shown in ﬁgure 4.1, sin(k1,2 ) and  are arranged like pearls
on a string in the complex plane. The above analysis is straightforwardly generalized: one
ﬁnds that 2m k’s can combine with m ’s to form a ‘k- string of length 2m’, which has
the form (u > 0)
k 1 = π − arcsin( + miu),

Here m denotes the ‘length’ of the string and j counts the λ’s involved in a given string.
 m is the real center of the k- string.

4.1.2 A composition principle
The simple calculation above has shown us that there exist particular solutions of the
Lieb-Wu equations that are very well approximated by strings. It is not difﬁcult to see
that such string solutions may be combined to form other solutions of the Lieb-Wu
equations. In other words, strings are the basic building blocks that make up general
solutions.
Let us illustrate this ‘composition principle’ for the case L = 6, N = 5, M = 2 and
u = 1.25, i.e. two spin-down and three spin-up electrons on a six-site lattice. The roots of
the Lieb-Wu equations can be easily obtained by a numerical root-ﬁnding algorithm such
as Newton’s method. One solution is
1 = 1.4230 ,

k1,2 = 2.3616 ± 1.3310 i ,

sin(k1,2 ) = 1.42385 ± 1.25142 i ,
2 = −0.0484 ,

k3,4 = 3.1665 ± 1.0499 i ,

sin(k3,4 ) = −0.0400 ± 1.2534 i,
k5 = −0.5842.

(4.11)

We may consider this solution to be composed of two k- strings of length two (as is easily
veriﬁed by comparison with (4.13)) and one real k, namely k5 .
A second solution is
1 = 0.5402 ,

k1,2 = 2.8085 ± 1.0870 i ,

sin(k1,2 ) = 0.5399 ± 1.2419 i ,
k3 = −1.7305 ,
2 = −0.7253.

k4 = 0.7330 ,

k5 = 1.6637 ,
(4.12)

It is composed of one k- string of length two, one real  (a ‘one-string’ of ’s) and three
real k’s, namely k3 , k4 , k5 .
As a given solution of the Lieb-Wu equations may ‘contain’ several k--strings (our ﬁrst
example above contains two) we introduce an index α to distinguish between them and

124

denote a k- string of length m by

4.1.3 Λ strings
It is clear from our construction that (4.13) are the only types of strings involving k’s.
However, there are also strings involving only ’s. In order to see this, let us consider a
situation where there are N real k j ’s, where N is very large. The Lieb-Wu equations for the
M ’s, where we assume that M  N , are

(4.15)

If we take Im(1 ) > 0, then the left-hand side of the equation for 1 tends to zero exponentially fast in N . As M  N this forces one of the factors on the right-hand side of the
equation to be very small. Without loss of generality we may take
2 = 1 − 2ui + O(e−γ N ) ,

(4.16)

where γ is some constant. Repeating these arguments for 2 and so on we ﬁnd that it is
possible for m ’s to form a ‘ string’, that is a conﬁguration of roots that is symmetric
around the real axis and has a spacing of 2iu between consecutive roots. We will denote
such strings by

Here α distinguishes the strings of the same length m, and j = 1, . . . , m counts the λ’s

α is the real center of the string. The solutions
(4.17) and (4.13), (4.14) were ﬁrst found by M. Takahashi in [435]. The fact that most solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations are well-described in terms of strings has been established
for small lattices by solving the Lieb-Wu equations numerically, see e.g. [95].

4.2 String solutions as bound states

4.2 String solutions as bound states
It is clear from the form of the Bethe ansatz wave function (3.91)–(3.94) that solutions
of the Lieb-Wu equations with only real k j ’s and λ ’s correspond to eigenstates of the
Hubbard Hamiltonian that are superpositions of plane waves. By their very construction
string solutions involve complex solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations. What then is the
physical nature of the eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian described by string solutions?
The answer is that they describe bound states of electrons in the sense that the many-body
wave function exhibits an exponential decay with respect to the difference of the coordinates
of electrons involved in a string. In the remainder of this section we illustrate this point by
considering simple examples.

4.2.1 k-Λ strings
Let us consider a two electron wave function where one of the electrons has spin up and
one spin down respectively (N = 2, M = 1). The Lieb-Wu equations are given by

string1
k1 = π − arcsin( + iu) ,
k2 = π − arcsin( − iu) .

(4.19)

For ﬁnite but large L there are deviations from (4.19), which are evaluated in detail in
Appendix 4.A. There it is shown that the solution of (4.18) for ﬁnite L can be expressed as
k1 = q − iξ = k2∗ ,

Taking the limit L → ∞ while keeping |x1 − x2 | ﬁxed, we may drop the subleading terms
indicated by the dots in (4.25) and arrive at the simple result
ψ(x1 , x2 ; ↓, ↑ |k1 , k2 ; ) = A eiq(x1 +x2 ) e−ξ |x1 −x2 | ,

(4.26)

where A is a normalization constant. Equation (4.26) shows that the k- string indeed
describes a bound state of two electrons. It is shown in Section 7.9 that the energy of the
bound state (4.26) is higher than the energy of a scattering state of two electrons. This
sounds very strange! However, in our previous discussion of the wave-function (4.26) in
Section 3.2.4 we showed that the bound-state property is a lattice effect and does not survive
a continuum limit.
Longer k- strings also describe bound states as may be shown by an analogous calculation, see e.g. the Appendix of [123].

4.2.2 Λ strings
Let us consider two down-spin electrons forming a  string and N − 2 up-spin electrons,
i.e. a solution to the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1) with
1 = ∗2 = λ − iu + i , λ ∈ R,
k j ∈ R , j = 1, . . . , N ,

(4.27)

where ||  1. Let us denote the positions of the down spins among the electrons by y1 and
y2 > y1 as illustrated in ﬁgure 4.2. What we want to show is that if we take N to inﬁnity
while keeping the ‘distance’ d = y2 − y1 ﬁxed, then the wave function corresponding to
(4.27) decays exponentially in d. In other words, the two down spins form a bound state (in
the sense deﬁned above) on the lattice formed by the electrons.

The inequality (4.34) ensures that (4.32) decays exponentially for y2  y1 . This implies that
the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. of (4.30) exhibits the desired exponential decay. On the other hand,
the second term on the r.h.s. of (4.30) vanishes in the limit N → ∞ if we keep y2 − y1
ﬁxed. This is established by multiplying (4.33) by (4.31) and then using the inequality
(4.34).

4.3 Takahashi’s equations
The string hypothesis for the Hubbard model was formulated by M. Takahashi in 1972 [435].
It postulates that all regular2 solutions {k j }, {λl } of the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1) are composed
of the three different classes of strings discussed above.
(i) A single real momentum k j .
(ii) m ’s combining into a  string (4.17). This includes the case m = 1, which is just a
single α .
(iii) 2m k’s and m ’s combining into a k- string (4.13), (4.14).
For large lattices (L  1) and a large number of electrons (N  1), almost all strings
are close to ideal, i.e. the imaginary parts of the k’s and λ’s are almost equally spaced.
The string hypothesis assumes that almost all solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1)
are approximately given by (4.13), (4.14), (4.17) with exponentially small corrections of
order O(exp(−δL)), where δ is real and positive and depends on the speciﬁc string under
consideration.
Using the string hypothesis, the task of solving the Lieb-Wu equations can be signiﬁcantly
simpliﬁed. Let us consider solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations for some particular, ﬁxed
values of N and M. Within the framework of the string hypothesis, every solution can be
represented in terms of a particular conﬁguration of strings: it contains Mn -strings and
Mn k- strings of length n (n = 1, 2, . . . ) and Me single k j ’s (i.e. k’s not associated with
k- strings). We call Me , Mn , Mn occupation numbers of the string conﬁguration under
consideration. The occupation numbers satisfy the ‘sum rules’

We recall that regular solutions are deﬁned by the property that all spectral parameters are ﬁnite, i.e. |k j | < ∞, λl < ∞.

Applying this prescription to the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1) and then taking the logarithm of
the resulting equations, we arrive at the following form of Bethe ansatz equations for the

obtained in an analogous way. Finally, the range of the I j ’s follows from the observation
that Takahashi’s equations for k j are invariant under shifting k j by 2π .

4.4 Completeness of the Bethe ansatz

131

Equations (4.36)–(4.46) can be used to study all excitations of the Hubbard model in
the thermodynamic limit (see Chapter 7). They are the basis for the derivation of Takahashi’s integral equations [435], which determine the thermodynamics of the Hubbard model
(see Chapter 5). These and other applications of (4.36)–(4.46) are based on the following
assumptions.
(i) Any set of non-repeating (half odd) integers I j , Jαn , J  nα subject to the constraints (4.44)–
(4.46) speciﬁes precisely one regular solution {k j }, {nα }, { nα } of equations (4.36)–
(4.38).
(ii) The solutions {k j }, {nα }, { nα } of (4.36)–(4.38) speciﬁed by a set of non-repeating
(half odd) integers I j , Jαn , J  nα subject to (4.44)–(4.46) are in one-to-one correspondence
to solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1).
(iii) For large L and N almost all solutions {k j }, {λl } of the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1) are
exponentially close to the corresponding solution {k j }, {nα }, { nα } of Takahashi’s
equations, which means that the strings contained in {k j }, {λl } are well approximated
by the ideal strings determined by {k j }, {nα }, { nα }.
How well the correspondence between the roots of the Lieb-Wu equations and Takahashi’s
equations works for ﬁnite L is an interesting question. Some aspects of this issue are
addressed in Appendix 4.A. For small lattices L ≤ 6 and ﬁxed u this question has been
investigated numerically in Ref. [95] and good agreement has been found.

4.4 Completeness of the Bethe ansatz
As a ﬁrst application of the string hypothesis, let us now address the issue whether the Bethe
ansatz actually gives a complete set of eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. On a lattice
of L sites there are 4 L eigenstates. Using the string hypothesis together with the SO(4)
symmetry and the highest-weight theorem it was shown in [123] that one can construct 4 L
linearly independent eigenstates from the solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations: the Bethe
ansatz gives a complete set of eigenstates. The proof of completeness of the Bethe ansatz
given in [123] is based on assumptions (i) and (ii) above. Note that assumption (ii) does
not mean that the classiﬁcation of the solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1) into strings
is actually given by (4.36)–(4.46). There may be a redistribution between different kinds
of solutions. This phenomenon was observed in a number of Bethe ansatz solvable models
and was carefully studied for several simple examples in Refs. [60, 123, 124]. It was found
that the redistribution did in no case affect the total number of solutions of the Bethe ansatz
equations. In Appendix 4.A we discuss deviations from the string hypothesis for some
particular examples.
Using (i) and (ii) above, the proof of completeness reduces to a combinatorial problem
based on equations (4.44)–(4.46) [123]. From (4.44)–(4.46) we may read off the numbers
of allowed values of the (half odd) integers I j , Jαn , J  nα in a given conﬁguration {Mn }, {Mn }
of strings. These are

Hence, the number of regular Bethe ansatz states for given numbers N of electrons and M

where the summation is over all conﬁgurations of strings which satisfy the obvious con

m=1 m(Mm + Mm ).
As has been shown in Appendices 3.D and 3.F all regular Bethe ansatz states are lowest
weight states with respect to the SO(4) symmetry. This implies that each regular Bethe ansatz
state with N electrons and M down spins gives rise to a SO(4) multiplet of eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian of dimension
dim M,N = (N − 2M + 1)(L − N + 1).

(4.55)

Hence the total number of states in the SO(4) extended Bethe ansatz is

where the sum is over all M, N with 0 ≤ 2M ≤ N ≤ L. The sums (4.54) and (4.56) are
evaluated in Appendix 4.B following the original calculation [123]. It turns out that
n tot (L) = 4 L

,

(4.57)

which is the dimension of the Hilbert space of the Hubbard model on an L-site chain.
The essential ingredients of the proof of completeness can be summarized as follows:
(i) Impose periodic boundary conditions.
(ii) Construct an explicit expression for the wave functions. We use the form (3.91)–(3.94).
(iii) Introduce the concept of regular Bethe ansatz states (see Section 3.3.2). This eliminates
inﬁnite k’s and λ’s, whose multiplicities are not under control.
(iv) Prove the lowest weight theorem (3.101), (3.105) for regular Bethe ansatz states. This
establishes that each regular Bethe ansatz state gives rise to a SO(4) multiplet of
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of dimension (4.55).

For a deﬁniton see Eqn. (4.B.2).

4.5 Higher-level Bethe ansatz

133

(v) Enumerate all regular Bethe ansatz states for ﬁxed numbers of electrons N and down
spins M by means of Takahashi’s integers (4.44)–(4.46).
(vi) Calculate the total number of states by taking into account the SO(4) multiplet associated with each regular Bethe ansatz state.

4.5 Higher-level Bethe ansatz
The string hypothesis is a statement on the allowed patterns of Bethe ansatz roots, i.e. the
distributions of roots in the complex plane compatible with the Bethe ansatz equations. As
we have seen above, the patterns are derived by considering small numbers of roots on large
lattices. In the Hubbard model this corresponds to very low densities of electrons. On the
other hand, we are mainly interested in the physical properties of the Hubbard model at
a ﬁnite electron density in the thermodynamic limit. It is not a priori clear that the string
hypothesis will provide a good description of this limit. The direct application of the string
hypothesis in the analogous case of the spin- 12 Heisenberg XXZ chain was ﬁrst criticized
by C. Destri and J.H. Lowenstein in [98].
A priori there are two reasons for the potential failure of the string hypothesis. Let us
revisit the reasoning leading to the form (4.17) for ideal -strings. We used the fact that
the l.h.s. of the Lieb-Wu equations (4.15) goes to zero exponentially in the electron number
N if l has a positive imaginary part. This implies that the r.h.s. of the Lieb-Wu equations
(4.15) must vanish in the thermodynamic limit
N
ﬁxed.
(4.58)
L
at ﬁnite density. As long as the number of down spins M remains ﬁnite we conclude that
one of the numerators on the r.h.s. converges to 0. This chain of reasoning may break
down if: (i) for some reason the imaginary part of the complex root tends to zero in the
thermodynamic limit such that the l.h.s. does not necessarily converge to 0, or (ii) we are
considering a state with a system size dependent number of roots such that the r.h.s. of the
Lieb-Wu equation involves an increasing number of factors, i.e.
N, L → ∞ ,

M
ﬁxed.
(4.59)
L
In case (ii) the r.h.s. of the Lieb-Wu equations (4.15) can be a product of ﬁnite factors but
nevertheless vanish in the limit (4.59). This case is of particular importance for studying
low-lying excitations above the ground state at a ﬁxed density. Detailed studies in the spin- 12
XXZ chain [30, 471, 483, 484], the XYZ model [259] and the Hubbard model [258] have
shown that although the string hypothesis does not hold per se, its application still yields
exact results for e.g. the spectrum of low-lying excitations.

4.A On deviations from the string hypothesis
In this appendix we discuss in more detail the relation between the roots of the Lieb-Wu
equations and the solutions to Takahashi’s equations. We will show that in general the
correspondence between them unsurprisingly is not perfect. For simplicity we concentrate
on the particular example of a k- string solution N = 2, M = 1 on a lattice of L sites,
which we already encountered in Section 4.1. It is convenient to rewrite equations (4.3),
(4.4) by
(i) multiplying (4.3) and (4.4), using (4.5) to replace the right-hand side of the resulting
equation by 1 and then taking the logarithm, and
(ii) solving (4.3) and (4.4) for sin k j − .

It is easy to see from (4.3)–(4.5) that k2 actually must be the complex conjugate of k1 for
the particular solution we are interested in. We therefore may set
k1 = q − iξ,

k2 = q + iξ ,

(4.A.3)

with real q and real, positive ξ . It then follows from (4.A.2) that

graphically, which is done in ﬁgure 4.A.1. Depending on the value of m there is either
exactly one solution of (4.A.9) or no solution at all. The latter is easily understood by
noting that due to the fact that g(ξ ) > 0 for all ξ > 0, equation (4.A.9) can have solutions
for positive ξ only if
π
< |q| ≤ π for u > 0 ,
2
|q| < π2
for u < 0 .

(4.A.11)

In order to keep things simple, let us concentrate on the repulsive case u > 0. It follows from
(4.A.10) that (4.A.9) always has exactly one solution ξm for every even m which satisﬁes
(4.A.11). A fact that can be gleaned from ﬁgure 4.A.1 is that in order for a solution with

(4.A.13)

What we have found is that whenever the length of the lattice L is sufﬁciently large and
(4.A.13) is satisﬁed, there is precisely one k- two string solution for every m that satisﬁes
(4.A.7) and (4.A.11). We can easily count these solutions: for odd L there are L solutions
and for even L there are L − 1 of them. In order to illustrate what these solutions actually
look like, we plot all solutions with  > 0 for L = 20 and two different values of u in
ﬁgure 4.A.2. In order to obtain simple patterns we plot sin(k1,2 ) rather than k1,2 . As long as
u L is sufﬁciently much larger than the critical value 2 determined above, the ‘spacing’ of
the strings, that is the distance between  and sin(k1,2 ), is essentially constant and equal to
u. This is exampliﬁed in ﬁgure 4.A.2 (a). On the other hand, as soon as u L approaches 2
there are considerable deviations in the spacings as can be seen in ﬁgure 4.A.2(b). There

4.B Details about the enumeration of eigenstates

137

are two branches, corresponding to even and odd m respectively. The spacing of the even
(odd) m branch increases (decreases) as  becomes small.
Let us compare these results to what we would predict on the basis of Takahashi’s
equations (4.36)–(4.38) and the allowed values of (half-odd) integers (4.44)–(4.46). The
only nonzero occupation number for the solution we are considering is M1 = 1. Hence the
allowed range of integers is |J  1 | ≤ 12 (L − t11 − 1) = 12 (L − 2), which means that there are
L − 1 possible values of J  1 . This agrees with what we just found since L was assumed
to be even in (4.44)–(4.46). Let us furthermore investigate how well the actual solutions of
the Lieb-Wu equations are reproduced by the roots of Takahashi’s equations. The latter are

L
1
2L Re arcsin( α + iu) = 2π − + α , α = 1, . . . L − 1,
(4.A.14)
2
and by construction we have sin(kα1,2 ) =  1α ± iu. Solving (4.A.14) for L = 20 we ﬁnd that
the solutions of Takahashi’s equations for u = 0.25 are very close to the actual solutions of
the Lieb-Wu equations: the relative errors are at most 1.4% in the imaginary parts and much
less than a percent in the real parts. For smaller u the situation gets worse as is apparent
from ﬁgure (4.A.2)(b): the imaginary parts of sin(k1,2 ) obtained by solving the Lieb-Wu
equations deviate very signiﬁcantly from ±iu. On the other hand the differences between
the real centers of the strings  and the  1α obtained from (4.A.14) are still very small: the
relative errors are less than a percent.
One obvious question is what happens when we decrease u below the ‘critical’ value
2/L. Now the inequality (4.A.12) is violated for one or more odd m and as a result there are
fewer than L − 1 k- string solutions (for even L) with N = 2 and M = 1 to the Lieb-Wu
equations. The disappearance of these solutions as u is decreased from an initially large
u > 2/L can be visualized as follows. At ﬁrst the spacing sin(k2 ) − sin(k1 ) of the odd-m
solutions decreases below the ideal value 2u. This effect is particularly pronounced for the
solutions with small real parts of sin(k1,2 ) (and thus ) and can be seen in ﬁgure 4.A.2(b).
As u approaches 2/L from above, the spacings of the two solutions with ± closest to
zero turn to zero: the strings ‘collapse’. For values of u smaller than 2/L, there are two
solutions with real k1,2 in place of the collapsed k- strings. More details of this process
can be found in Refs. [123] and [95].
On the other hand the number of solutions of Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) is by
construction independent of u. Hence, if u becomes too small, the solutions of the Lieb-Wu
equations are in general quite different from the solutions of Takahashi’s equations. At ﬁrst
sight this looks like a very serious problem. However, we are really interested in taking L
very large while keeping u ﬁxed. In this limit the condition (4.A.12) is always satisﬁed.
Of course this does not guarantee that the string hypothesis is valid for all solutions of the
Lieb-Wu equations.
4.B Details about the enumeration of eigenstates
In this appendix we evaluate the total number of states obtained by combining the SO(4)
symmetry with the Bethe ansatz. Our presentation closely parallels the original paper [123].

The total number of regular solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations for given numbers of electrons N and electrons with spin down M is now obtained by summing n(Me , {Mm }, {Mm })
over all the occupation numbers Me , Mm and Mm , subject to the constraints (4.44)–(4.46)

(4.B.3)

Every solution to the Lieb-Wu equations (4.1) gives rise to a regular Bethe ansatz state, which
comes with an entire SO(4) multiplet of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The dimension
dim M,N of this multiplet is given by
dim M,N↑ = (N↑ − M + 1)(L − N↑ − M + 1).

In order to have a complete set this total number must be equal to 4 L . The counting of the
eigenstates obtained from the S O(4) extended nested Bethe ansatz has thus been reduced
to a purely algebraic problem.

4.B.1 Simple examples: 2 and 4 site lattices
Before turning to the general case let us see how things work for the 2-site and 4site models. The 2-site model (L = 2) was discussed in detail in Ref. [125], where a
complete set of 42 = 16 eigenstates of the Hamiltonian was constructed explicitly. In
table 4.B.1 we show how these eigenstates are classiﬁed in terms of the SO(4) extended
Bethe ansatz.
The wave functions and energies of all 16 eigenstates of the L = 2 site system are given
in Ref. [125]. The total number of 16 states splits into 2 singlets, 2 triplets and 2 quadruplets
of S O(4). The ground state is the singlet with M1 = 1 for the case
√ u > 0 and the singlet with
M1 = 1 for the case u < 0. In both cases it has energy E 0 = − 4u 2 + 16. The counting for
the 4-site model (L = 4) is presented in table 4.B.2, where we show how the total number
of 44 = 256 is obtained. We note that the total number of regular Bethe ansatz states is
only 60.
An explicit enumeration of a complete set of eigenstates for the L = 6 site system has
been carried out in Ref. [95].

4.B.2 Counting eigenstates
In this subsection we will evaluate the right hand side of (4.B.5) explicitly for general even
L and show that it equals 4 L . This will establish completeness. We will split this proof into
two steps as follows. In the ﬁrst step we will prove Lemmas 2 and 3. In the second step
we will then use these lemmas to perform the summation in (4.B.5). To keep the notation

Let us now prove both RR Ip and RR IIp by mathematical induction. We start with Zn(0) as
deﬁned in (4.B.14), and U2 and U3 as given in (4.B.26). One easily checks that RR IIp=0
is valid. Using (4.B.22) to construct U4 = 1/Z4(1) and then making use of RR IIp=0 , one
obtains RR Ip=0 . This establishes the validity of both RR Ip=0 and RR IIp=0 , which is the
starting point for the proof by induction.
Let us now assume that RR Ip and RR IIp hold for a given p. Using this induction
assumption and the deﬁnition of Zn(m) (4.B.22) we establish the validity of RR IIp+1 .
Finally, RR Ip+1 follows from RR IIp+1 and (4.B.22). This completes the induction
step.

4.B Details about the enumeration of eigenstates

145

Lemmas 2 and 3 have a natural interpretation in the context of the spin- 12 Heisenberg
XXX model [433]. Equation (4.B.8) gives the total number of regular Bethe ansatz states
(deﬁned by M ≤ [N /2]) with M overturned spins in the XXX model on a lattice of
length N . The second formula shows that the total number of states obtained by combining
the regular Bethe ansatz with the SU (2) symmetry equals 2N , which is the dimension
of the Hilbert space of the XXX model. These relations thus establish the completeness
of the SU (2) extended Bethe ansatz for the XXX model. The fact that identities that have
their origin in the XXX model play a role here should not come as a surprise. Indeed, our
method of solution of the Hubbard model is the nested Bethe ansatz. The solutions to the
Bethe ansatz are speciﬁed by two sets {k j } and {α } of spectral parameters. The k j ’s are
momenta associated with charge degrees of freedom, whereas the α ’s, which describe
the ‘nesting’ of the Bethe ansatz, are rapidities of spin excitations of the type encountered
in the Heisenberg XXX model. This should make clear that the second stage of the nested
Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model is really a spin-problem, which is very similar to the
Bethe ansatz analysis of the Heisenberg XXX model. This fact can be seen directly in our
construction of the wave functions in Appendix 3.B. Our two-step procedure for performing
the summation is natural from the point of view of the nesting: in the ﬁrst step we sum over
the spin degrees of freedom, and in the second step we then sum over the charge degrees of
freedom as well.
The total number of states obtained from the SO(4) extended Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard
model is given by (4.B.1) and (4.B.5). The summations over the multiplicities Mm and over
the difference N↑ − M in the summation (4.B.5) can be carried out by using Lemmas 2
and 3 respectively, if we substitute M → 12 (Me − N↑ + M) and N → Me . (Under these
summations the total number of electrons N is kept ﬁxed.) The summation that remains
after this ‘spin summation’ is

Thermodynamics in the Yang-Yang approach

Let us now turn to the determination of thermodynamic quantities and the zero-temperature
excitation spectrum in the thermodynamic limit. A convenient way to construct the spectrum
was pioneered by C. N. Yang and C. P. Yang for the case of the delta-function Bose gas [496].
The starting point are the Bethe Ansatz equations in the ﬁnite volume. They are used to
derive a set of coupled, nonlinear integral equations called thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
(TBA) equations, which describe the thermodynamics of the model at ﬁnite temperatures.
The quantities entering these equations have a natural interpretation in terms of dressed
energies of elementary excitations. Yang and Yang’s formalism is a natural generalization
of the thermodynamics of the free Fermi gas to interacting systems. In order to elucidate this
point we brieﬂy review the calculations for the thermodynamics of noninteracting electrons.

thermodynamic limit starting from a ﬁnite but large volume L. We then keep the densities

Nσ

L

(5.9)

Let us consider a state characterized by the Nσ momenta k1σ < k2σ < . . . < k σNσ . As the
momentum density of states is constant, there is a ﬂat distribution of L ‘vacancies’ for the
Nσ momenta. A single particle state with given momentum ka and spin σ can be either
occupied, in which case we speak of a ‘particle’ with spin σ and momentum ka being
present, or unoccupied, in which case we speak of a ‘hole’ with quantum numbers ka and
σ . Let us introduce densities for particles ρ L(σ,)p (k) and holes ρ L(σ,h) (k)
# of particles with spin σ and momentum in [k, k + k] = ρ L(σ,)p (k) k ,
# of holes with spin σ and momentum in [k, k + k] = ρ L(σ,h) (k) k .

ρ L(σ ) (k) = ρ L(σ,)p (k) + ρ L(σ,h) (k) =

We note that the last line of (5.12) is of the form of a discretized integral. Now we take the
inﬁnite volume limit for ﬁxed densities n σ . In a ﬁnite volume the momentum densities of
states are deﬁned on a discrete set of momenta. In the thermodynamic limit they turn into
functions of the continuous momentum

The number of states with spin σ and momentum in the interval [k, k + k] is equal to the
number of possibilities for distributing Lk ρ L(σ,)p (k) particles among Lk ρ L(σ ) (k) vacancies,
which is equal to

using Stirling’s formula. The O(L) contribution to the entropy is then given by

can be found in [287]. Let us recall that we are working with the following form of the

(5.26)

This is done by turning Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) into a system of coupled
integral equations for root densities of particles and holes. The integral equations will
allow us to express the root densities of holes in terms of those of particles. The analogous
relation for noninteracting fermions is given by equation (5.11).
r In Step 2 we express the entropy and the Gibbs free energy in terms of the root distribution
functions.
r Finally, in Step 3 we minimize the Gibbs free energy with respect to the root densities and obtain a set of coupled, nonlinear integral equations that describe the state of
thermodynamic equilibrium.
L →∞,

Nσ → ∞ ,

Steps 2 and 3 are analogous, albeit signiﬁcantly more complicated, to our derivation for
noninteracting electrons in Section 5.1.
Step 1: Our starting point are Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) and expressions for
energy (4.52) and momentum (4.51) for large but ﬁnite L. The key fact we will use is that in
the framework of the string hypothesis there is a one-to-one correspondence between sets
of (half-odd) integers and sets of spectral parameters, i.e.
{I j , Jαn , J  β } ←→ {k j , nα ,  β } .

to adopt the following picture. The integers I j have a certain allowed range, in which we

choose a particular distribution when we specify the set (5.27). Due to (5.27) there is a corresponding pattern of spectral parameters k j . This can be visualized as shown in ﬁgure 5.1.
Analogous pictures hold for the (half-odd) integers Jαn (J  nα ) and the corresponding spectral
parameters nα ( nα ). In what follows it will be very useful to view the distributions of
spectral parameters in terms of particles and holes.
A very important property of Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) is that as we approach
the thermodynamic limit L → ∞, N /L and M/L ﬁxed (ﬁnite densities of electrons and
spin down electrons), the roots of (4.36)–(4.38) become dense

In the next step we deﬁne root densities, which are related to the counting functions as
follows. By deﬁnition the counting functions ‘enumerate’ the Bethe Ansatz roots e.g.
L[y(k j ) − y(kn )] = 2π (I j − In ).

(5.34)

For a given solution of Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) some of the (half-odd) integers
between I j and In will be ‘occupied’ i.e. there will be a corresponding root k, whereas
others will be omitted. We describe the corresponding k-values in terms of a root density
ρ p (k) for ‘particles’ and a density ρ h (k) for ‘holes’. These root densities for particles and
holes are the analogs of the particle and hole densities of state for noninteracting electrons.
In a very large system we then have by deﬁnition (here the property (5.28) is essential)
Lρ p (k) dk = number of particles in dk ,
Lρ h (k) dk = number of holes in dk .

(5.35)

Combining equations (5.34) and (5.35) it is then clear that in the thermodynamic limit we
have
2π[ρ p (k) + ρ h (k)] =

Equations (5.41) can be used to express the densities of holes in terms of densities of
particles. They are the analog of equation (5.11) for noninteracting electrons.
Step 2: In order to obtain an expression for the Gibbs free energy we need to determine
the entropy. A general state is characterized by its distribution of Bethe Ansatz roots. In the

5.2 Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations

157

thermodynamic limit, states can be described in terms of the root densities of particles and
holes. We therefore can view the entropy as a functional of the root densities. For a given
set of particle and hole densities, the contribution to the entropy of, e.g., states with k lying
in the interval [k, k + k] can be determined as follows:
The number of vacancies for k in the interval [k, k + k] is L(ρ p (k) + ρ h (k))k. Of
these vacancies Lρ p (k)k are occupied. The total number of states with k lying in the
interval [k, k + k] is
(L[ρ p (k) + ρ h (k)]k)!
,
(Lρ p (k)k)!(Lρ h (k)k)!

(5.44)

where ‘!’ denotes the factorial. The corresponding contribution d S to the entropy is the
logarithm of this number of states, which becomes large as we approach the thermodynamic limit. Hence we can use Stirling’s formula to approximate the factorials in (5.44). In
this way we obtain the following expression for the total entropy per site of the Hubbard
model

Here µ is a chemical potential, B is a magnetic ﬁeld, T is the temperature, n c is the particle

ﬁeld B ≥ 0 and negative values of chemical potential µ ≤ 0. All other parameter regions
can be obtained from the one we consider by employing the discrete symmetries of the
Hamiltonian (see Section 2.2.4). Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian (in zero ﬁeld)
(2.31) under interchange of up and down spins we have (2.63)
f (µ, −B, T ) = f (µ, B, T ) .

(5.47)

Similarly, if we employ the particle-hole transformation
†

c j,↑ ↔ c j,↓ (−1) j ,

†

c j,↓ ↔ c j,↑ (−1) j

(5.48)

f (−µ, B, T ) = f (µ, B, T ) + 2µ .

(5.49)

we may derive the equality (2.64)

Step 3: The state of thermodynamic equilibrium minimizes the Gibbs free energy
f (5.46). As f is a functional of the root densities, the state of thermodynamic equilibrium must be stationary with respect to variations in a maximal set of independent root
densities. As the hole densities are expressed in terms of the particle densities by (5.41),
this yields the requirement

where we have to take (5.41) into account as constraint equations. We ﬁrst evaluate the

(5.66)

εn () = T ln(ηn ()) ,

(5.67)

εn () = T ln(ηn ()) .

(5.68)

As was ﬁrst shown by C. N. Yang and C. P. Yang for the delta-function Bose gas [496],
the quantities deﬁned in this way describe the dressed energies of elementary excitations
in the zero temperature limit. We will discuss this point in detail in Chapter 7. We note
that for noninteracting electrons we had ξ (σ ) (k) = ε0(σ ) (k), i.e. the ratio of hole and particle
densities of states is equal to the exponential of the ‘bare’ (or single-particle) energy divided
by temperature. In the Hubbard model the dressed energies are very different from the bare
ones as a result of the electron-electron interactions.

We note that ρ0 , σ0 and e0 are the root density for real k’s, the root density for real ’s
and the ground state energy per site for the half ﬁlled repulsive Hubbard model, respectively
[298] (see Eqn. (6.B.14)). Since the occurrence of quantities related to the half ﬁlled Hubbard
model in (5.69) may be surprising, we would like to emphasize that (5.69), (5.70) hold for
all negative values of the chemical potential µ, i.e. for all particle densities between zero
and one.
The representation (5.69) is convenient as it shows that the Gibbs free energy is determined
by the dressed energies for real k’s and real ’s only. In order to derive (5.69) the following
identities are useful

At very low temperatures T  B it is possible to determine the Gibbs free energy by using
an expansion of the TBA equations (5.54)–(5.56) for small T [436]. The TBA equations
essentially reduce to only two coupled equations for ζ and η1 in this limit. For generic values
of B and arbitrary temperatures one needs to resort to a numerical solution of (5.54)–(5.56).
In order to do so, one needs to truncate the inﬁnite towers of equations for  and k-
strings at some ﬁnite value of their respective lengths. In [240, 469] such a truncated set of
equations was solved by iteration. The integrals were discretized by using approximately
50 (100) points for the k () integrations. The results of these computations are compared
to the results of the Quantum Transfer Matrix approach in chapter 13.

In this limit we may neglect the driving terms in the TBA equations (5.54)–(5.56), which

ηn () −→ ηn ,
ηn () −→ ηn .

(5.73)

(5.77)

5.5 Zero temperature limit

163

5.5 Zero temperature limit
In the limit T → 0 the TBA equations simplify in an essential way. The key to these
simpliﬁcations is that many of the dressed energies εn (), εm () are positive for all values
of  and as a consequence their contributions to the right hand sides of the TBA equations
(5.54)–(5.56) vanish. For example, by equation (5.60) we have
εn () = T ln ηn () > 0

n = 2, 3, . . .

5.5.4 Zero temperature limit in zero magnetic ﬁeld
If we take the limit of vanishing magnetic ﬁeld, equations (5.83)–(5.86) simplify further.
Taking B → 0 corresponds to A → ∞. In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetization
must be zero [293] as otherwise the spin rotational SU(2) symmetry would be broken, which
is forbidden in one dimension by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. For A = ∞ we have

where the last equality is obtained by inserting the integral equation (5.93). We thus ﬁnd that
for A = ∞, the numbers of up and down spins are the same N↓ = N↑ and the magnetization
is indeed zero.
Using Fourier transformation, equations (5.83) and (5.85) can be simpliﬁed

κ (n) (π − k) − κ (n) (k) = 4 cos(k) ≥ 0

which establishes the second inequality in Lemma 4. The ﬁnal inequality in Lemma 4 is

Lemma 5. The limit ε1(n) () = lim ε1(n,m) () exists.

Proof. By mathematical induction we can prove that

κ (n) (k) ≥ κ (n+1) (k) ,

(5.B.16)

ε1(n) () ≥ ε1(n+1) () .

(5.B.17)

Proof. All three inequalities are proved by mathematical induction in n.
Induction start: It is obvious from the deﬁnition (5.B.3) that κ (1) (k) ≥ κ (2) (k). Using this
fact, we can show by mathematical induction in m that ε1(1,m) () ≥ ε1(2,m) (): the case m = 1
is obvious, m = 2 is equivalent to proving that
 π
dk cos(k) s( − sin(k))[κ (1)− (k) − κ (2)− (k)] ≥ 0.
(5.B.18)

The integral (5.B.18) is rewritten as

where
f n (k) = κ (n)− (k) − κ (n)− (π − k) .

By equation (5.B.9) we have
f n (k) = κ (n)− (k) − [κ (n) (k) + 4 cos(k)]−

κ (n)− (k)
if (κ (n) (k) + 4 cos(k)) ≥ 0 ,
−4 cos(k) if (κ (n) (k) + 4 cos(k)) ≤ 0 .

Using the fact that κ (1) (k) ≥ κ (2) (k) we obtain

if κ (1) (k) ≤ −4 cos(k) ,
0

f 1 (k) − f 2 (k) = κ (k) − κ (k) if κ (2) (k) ≥ −4 cos(k) ,

(5.B.22)

which establishes that f 1 (k) − f 2 (k) ≥ 0 for k ∈ [0, π/2]. This completes the proof that
ε1(1,m) () ≥ ε1(2,m) (). The induction over m is carried out by assuming that ε1(1,m−1) () ≥

(5.B.23)

The ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. of (5.B.23) is greater than zero by (5.B.18) and the second term is
positive as the integrand is always positive by virtue of the induction assumption. Taking the
limit m → ∞, which exists by Lemma 5, we obtain that ε1(1) () ≥ ε1(2) (). This establishes
the validity of the induction start n = 1.
Induction step: The inequality ε1(n−1) () ≥ ε1(n) () implies κ (n) (k) ≥ κ (n+1) (k) courtesy of
the deﬁnition (5.B.3). The proof that ε1(n,m) () ≥ ε1(n+1,m) () is accomplished by mathematical induction in m in complete analogy to the n = 1 case. Finally taking the limit m → ∞
gives ε1(n) () ≥ ε1(n+1) (). This completes the proof of Lemma 6.

Lemma 6 shows that both κ (n) (k) and ε1(n) () decrease under iteration. On the other hand,
they can be bounded from below by using the inequality (5.B.14). This shows that the limit
n → ∞ exists.
Finally, the monotonicity properties of the dressed energies are established by the following two Lemmas.
Lemma 7. (a) ε1(n,m) () is a monotonously increasing function (MIF) of  for  ∈ [0, ∞].
(b) κ (n) (k) is a MIF of k for k ∈ [0, π/2].
Proof. We rewrite the recursion relation for ε1(n,m+1) () as

where z = arcsin(). The function ϕ (n) () is a symmetric, continuous function of  and
increases monotonously with  > 0 if κ (n) (k) is a MIF of k in the interval [0, π/2]. We are
now in a position to prove Lemma 7 by mathematical induction.
Induction start: ε1(1,1) () is a MIF of . κ (1) (k) is a MIF in the interval [0, π/2], implying
that ϕ (1) () is a MIF of . Mathematical induction in m establishes that ε1(1,m) () deﬁned
by the recursion relation (5.B.24) is a MIF of  and taking the limit m → ∞ we obtain
that ε1(1) () has the same property. Application of the recursion relation (5.B.3) shows that
κ (2) (k) is a MIF of k in [0, π/2].
Induction step: Assuming that κ (n) (k) is a MIF of k in the interval [0, π/2] it follows that
(n)
ϕ () deﬁned by (5.B.25) is a MIF of . This fact allows us to show by mathematical
induction in m that ε1(n,m) () as deﬁned in (5.B.24) and hence also ε1(n) () are MIF of .
Application of the recursion relation (5.B.3) then establishes that κ (n+1) (k) is a MIF of k in
[0, π/2].

Lemma 8. κ (n) (k) is a MIF of k for k ∈ [π/2, π ].
Proof. We rewrite the equation (5.B.2) for ε (n) () by replacing κ (n)− (k) by κ (n) (k) −
κ (n)+ (k) in the integrand of the second integral and then utilizing the recursion (5.B.3) for
κ (n) (k) together with the ‘symmetric integration Lemma’ (17.1). This yields

We are now in a position to prove the Lemma by mathematical induction.
Induction start: it follows from the deﬁnition (5.B.2) that κ (1) (k) is a MIF of k in the
interval [π/2, π ].
Induction step: Assuming that κ (n) (k) is a MIF of k in the interval [π/2, π ] we will prove
that κ (n+1) (k) has the same property.
We have already shown that ε1(n) is a symmetric function of  and increases monotonously
for  > 0. This implies that the second term on the r.h.s. of (5.B.27) is a MIF of k in the

(5.B.28)

The term in braces is a monotonously decreasing function of k  by virtue of the induction
assumption and Lemma 7. This in turn implies that the integral is a MIF of k in the interval
[π/2, π]. Finally, the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. is equal to

(5.B.29)
Here κ0 (k) is the dressed energy for a half ﬁlled band in zero magnetic ﬁeld, see (6.B.8).
Using the series representation (6.B.9) we can easily see that κ0 (k) is a MIF of k in the
interval [π/2, π]. This completes the proof of Lemma 8.

Ground state properties in the thermodynamic limit

In this chapter we study the ground state properties in the thermodynamic limit. In particular
we determine the ground state phase diagram and calculate density, magnetization, magnetic
susceptibility and compressibility as functions of the chemical potential and the magnetic
ﬁeld. This is done by analyzing the integral equations that determine the distributions
of Bethe Ansatz roots in the ground state. This method was introduced for the case of
the spin- 12 Heisenberg model by Hulthén [207]. Our discussion is based on Takahashi’s
work [435, 436].

6.1 A point of reference: noninteracting electrons
Before tackling the general case let us consider noninteracting electrons (u = 0). Here zero
temperature properties can be determined in a simple way by going to momentum space.1
The energy for an electron with spin σ and momentum k is
εσ (k) = −2 cos(k) − µσ ,

If we consider a less than half ﬁlled band (µ < 0) we arrive at the phase diagram for
noninteracting electrons shown in ﬁgure 6.1. Using the picture of the ground state in terms of
two bands for spin up and spin down electrons respectively we obtain four different phases:
r Phase I: k

F,σ = 0: Empty Lattice.
Both bands are empty, the ground state is the empty lattice. The density and magnetization
are zero. The chemical potential must be sufﬁciently negative µ ≤ −2 − B in order for
the empty lattice to be the ground state.
r Phase II: k
F,↓ = 0, 0 < k F,↑ < π: Partially ﬁlled, spin polarized band.
The spin down band is empty, the spin up band is partially ﬁlled. The magnetization is
equal to half the density, which varies between 0 and 1. We have

is 1 and the magnetisation is 12 .

6.2 Deﬁning equations
The T → 0 limit of the thermodynamic equations can be used to characterize the ground
state of the system. The only dressed energies that can be negative are κ(k) and ε1 ().
From the deﬁnitions (5.68) and (5.53) it follows that if a dressed energy is positive for all
values of spectral parameter, then the corresponding root density of particles is identically
zero. This means that the ground state can only contain real k’s and real ’s. The integral
equations for the dressed energies are

switch sign, so that they are determined as functions of the chemical potential and the

κ(±Q) = 0,

ε1 (±A) = 0.

(6.11)

If κ(k) (ε1 ()) does not switch sign, then obviously Q = 0 or Q = π (A = ∞ or A = 0).
In general, equations (6.10) cannot be solved analytically, but it is quite straightforward to
solve them numerically with high accuracy. How to do this is outlined in Appendix 6.A.
The integral equations describing the root densities of the ground state are (5.95) and

6.3 Ground state phase diagram
Let us now discuss the ground state phase diagram for the interacting case u > 0. This can
be done either as a function of the chemical potential µ and the magnetic ﬁeld B, or as a

6.3 Ground state phase diagram

function of the particle density n c and the magnetization per site m, which are related to
the root densities by (6.14) and (6.15). It is important to note that in the grand canonical
ensemble the density is a function of both the chemical potential and the magnetic ﬁeld. The
same is true for the magnetization. This means that keeping the chemical potential ﬁxed
and varying the magnetic ﬁeld will change the density.
The different phases are most easily identiﬁed by considering the integration boundaries
Q and A as control parameters. We ﬁrst note that Q = 0 implies A = 0 and corresponds
to a completely empty band, i.e. N = 0. On the other hand, one can easily see by using the
identity (6.12) and (17.1) that Q = π implies that the band is half ﬁlled, i.e. there is one

i.e. the magnetization of the ground state is zero. The ﬁrst equality in (6.19) follows directly
from (6.14) and the second equality is obtained by integrating (6.13) between −∞ and
∞. On the other hand, for A = 0 the ground state is completely magnetized as N↓ = 0
by (6.14). These considerations allow us to distinguish between the following ﬁve phases
at zero temperature, which are shown in ﬁgures 6.4 and 6.5 in the canonical and grand
canonical ensemble respectively.
r Phase I: Q = 0, A = 0: Empty band.

This region corresponds to an empty band, i.e. zero density of electrons n c = m = 0. As
the ground state is the empty lattice, the dressed energies (6.10) must be always positive.
This yields the condition
µ ≤ µ0 (B) = −2 − 2u − B.
(6.20)
In other words, the chemical potential must be sufﬁciently negative in order for the ground
state to be given by the empty lattice. This is intuitively obvious.
r Phase II: 0 < Q < π, A = 0: Partially ﬁlled, spin polarized band.
This phase corresponds to electron densities between zero (empty band) and one (half
ﬁlled band) 0 < n c < 1 and completely polarized spins m = n c /2. The integral equations
for the dressed energies simplify to
κ(k) = −2 cos k − µ − 2u − B, κ(±Q) = 0,

As we have by deﬁnition Q < π , the magnetic ﬁeld must be smaller than an upper critical
ﬁeld Bu
B ≤ Bu = 2 − µ − 2u.

For B > Bu we have Q = π and the band is half ﬁlled. The requirement ε1 () ≥ 0 implies
that for ﬁxed µ the magnetic ﬁeld B must be larger than a critical value Bc , which is given
implicitly as the solution of the equation

κ(k) = −2 cos k − µ − 2u − B,

ε1 () = 2B − 4Re 1 − ( − iu)2 + 4u.

B ≥ B0 = 2 1 + u 2 − 2u,
µ ≥ 2 − 2u − B.

(6.29)

r Phase IV: 0 < Q < π, 0 < A ≤ ∞: Partially ﬁlled and magnetized band.

This phase corresponds to 0 < n c < 1, 0 ≤ m < n c /2. In general the integral equations
can only be solved numerically in this region. However, simpliﬁcations occur for B = 0
that for example allow to make analytic progress in the limits of small densities n c ≈ 0
and densities close to half-ﬁlling n c ≈ 1. These results are summarized in Sections 6.B.3
and 6.B.2 of Appendix 6.B.
r Phase V: Q = π, 0 < A ≤ ∞: Half ﬁlled, partially magnetized band.

By construction we have κ(k) ≤ 0 for all k ∈ [−π, π]. In the interior of Phase V κ(k) is
strictly negative for all values of k and in particular we have κ(±π ) < 0. The boundary
between regions IV and V is determined by the condition κ(±π ) = 0.
For zero magnetic ﬁeld B = 0, which corresponds to A = ∞, the integral equations (6.30)
can be solved explicitly by Fourier transformation as is shown in Appendix 6.B.1. The
chemical potential µ− separating phases IV and V at B = 0 can then be obtained by
setting κ(π) = 0 in the explicit expression (6.B.8) for κ(k). We ﬁnd

µ− (u) = 2 − 2u − 2
,
(6.31)
ω cosh(ωu)

where J1 is a Bessel function.2
We emphasize that throughout Region V the density is equal to 1, but the chemical
potential varies. This implies that µ is not an invertible function of n c . Physically this is
very interesting: as soon as the band is half ﬁlled (for ﬁxed B), it is no longer possible to
force additional electrons into the ground state by increasing the chemical potential by a
small amount. The only way this can happen is if all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with
one additional electron are separated in energy from the ground state by a ﬁnite gap. This
in turn implies that in phase V the Hubbard model describes an insulator for all u > 0. The
insulating state is of a rather unconventional nature: it is a Mott insulator [158, 331, 332].
Lieb and Wu’s demonstration that the half ﬁlled Hubbard model is an insulator was based
on proving that the chemical potential has a discontinuity. Denoting the ground state
energy for the Hubbard model with N electrons by E(N , u), we have
µ− (u) = E(L , u) − E(L − 1, u),

(6.32)

where L is the length of the lattice. On the other hand, the chemical potential necessary
to force one extra electron into the half ﬁlled ground state is by deﬁnition
µ+ (u) = E(L + 1, u) − E(L , u).

(6.33)

In order to calculate µ+ (u) we employ the Shiba transformation (2.61), which tells us that
E(L + 1, u) = E(L − 1, u) and hence
µ+ (u) = −µ− (u).

In order to see better why we are dealing with an unusual insulating state, let us compare
it to the generic case of a band insulator. In the latter the valence band is full and separated
from the conduction band by a band gap. An example of a band insulator is the tightbinding Hamiltonian

We see that adding an extra electron to the conduction band or making a hole in the
valence band costs an energy larger than the band gap 2V . The situation in the half ﬁlled
Hubbard model is quite different. If we neglect the interactions (i.e. set u = 0) we obtain
the simple cosine band shown in ﬁgure 6.3, which implies that the ground state is metallic.
This shows that the insulating nature of the half ﬁlled ground state in the repulsive Hubbard
model is driven entirely by electron-electron interactions! The phase transition from the
metallic phase at u = 0 to the Mott insulating state at u > 0 is an example of a Mott
transition [158, 332].
We are now in the position to exhibit the full ground state phase diagram of the repulsive
Hubbard model. In ﬁgures 6.4 and 6.5 we display the phase diagram as a function of
particle density n c and magnetization m and as a function of the chemical potential µ and
the magnetic ﬁeld B respectively. It is clear from these plots that n c and m are not invertible
functions of the chemical potential and the magnetic ﬁeld. For example, throughout region

III n c and m are ﬁxed, whereas both µ and B vary. For the sake of completeness we show
the complete phase diagram for both negative and positive values of the chemical potential
and magnetic ﬁeld in ﬁgure 6.6. The phases at positive values of the chemical potential are
obtained by exchanging particles and holes and the phases for negative magnetic ﬁelds by
exchanging up and down spins.
6.4 Density and magnetization
In the grand canonical ensemble the density n c and magnetization m are functions of
the chemical potential µ and the magnetic ﬁeld B. They can be calculated from the root
densities ρ(k) and σ1 () via (6.15). In general we need to solve the integral equations for the
root densities numerically. This may be done by following the steps outlined in Appendix
6.A. There are several limiting cases in which analytical solutions are possible. These are
discussed in Appendices 6.B.1, 6.B.2, 6.B.3 and 6.C.
6.4.1 Fixed B
Let us ﬁrst consider the density as function of the chemical potential for ﬁxed magnetic
ﬁeld B.
Zero magnetic ﬁeld For B = 0 we obtain the behaviour shown in ﬁgure 6.7. For µ <
µ0 (0) = −2 − 2u the density is zero. In the vicinity of the boundary between Phases I and
IV the density in Phase IV increases in a universal square root fashion (6.B.32) as is shown
in Appendix 6.B.3

The density then increases monotonically with µ until it reaches 1 at µ− (u) < 0 (6.31)

(6.39)
where the coefﬁcient c1 is calculated in Appendix 6.B.2 (see equation (6.B.26)). This is
an example of the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition [111, 193, 363, 381].
The ground state at µ > µ− is half ﬁlled and commensurate with the symmetries of the
underlying lattice. For µ < µ− the ground state is partially ﬁlled and the long-distance
asymptotics of correlation functions exhibit oscillating behaviour with a characteristic wave
number related to the band ﬁlling.
Finite magnetic ﬁeld The behaviour of n c (µ) in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, which leads to a
complete polarization of the ground state, has been discussed in Section (6.3). In phase II
we have (6.27)

In ﬁgure 6.8 we plot the density as function of the chemical potential for u = 1.25 and
three different values of the magnetic ﬁeld B. We see that the density has a cusp at the
values of µ, where the transition between phases II and IV occurs for the given values of B.
For ﬁelds above the critical ﬁeld B0 phase IV no longer exists and there is a transition from
phase II to phase III instead. We have B0 ≈ 0.702 for u = 1.25.

Let us now determine the magnetization m and the density n c as functions of the applied
ﬁeld B for ﬁxed values of the chemical potential µ. Solving the relevant integral equations
numerically yields the magnetization curves shown in ﬁgure 6.9(a). At small ﬁelds m
increases linearly with B
m(B) µ=const ∝ B.

The constant of proportionality is the magnetic susceptibility in zero ﬁeld and can be
obtained by taking the limit B → 0 in equation (6.76) below.
At the critical ﬁeld Bc corresponding to the transition between phases II and IV there is a
cusp in the magnetization. For large ﬁelds B we eventually cross the phase boundary between
phase II and III, which occurs at Bu = 2 − µ − 2u. In phase III we have n c = 2m = 1.
Approaching the phase boundary from within phase II, both n c and m exhibit a characteristic

different values of n c and u = 1. As a function of B the magnetization increases from zero
and reaches its saturation value n2c at the critical ﬁeld Bc deﬁned in (6.24). For larger ﬁelds
B > Bc the magnetization remains constant.
The magnetization at half-ﬁlling was ﬁrst calculated by Takahashi in [435,436]. Magnetic
properties in the less than half ﬁlled band were ﬁrst calculated by Shiba [396].
6.5 Spin and charge velocities
In the Fermi gas the Fermi velocity v F is deﬁned as the group velocity of elementary
excitations. It is obtained by taking the derivative of the quasiparticle energy with respect to
the momentum at the Fermi surface. In the Hubbard model the ground state in phase IV can
be thought of as being described by two partially ﬁlled ‘Fermi seas’ of spectral parameters
k j and 1α respectively and it is possible to deﬁne two characteristic velocities

k and  to the respective Fermi seas. Their explicit expressions have been given before in
(5.98), (5.99). The labelling of the velocities is chosen to reﬂect the fact that vc,s are the
group velocities of charge and spin excitations respectively. This fact is proved in Chapter 7.
In order to determine the charge and spin velocities we ﬁrst need to solve the following set
of coupled integral equations for the derivatives of the dressed energies, which are obtained
from (6.10) by taking derivatives and exploiting the fact that κ(±Q) = ε1 (±A) = 0:

The denominators of (6.44),(6.45) are proportional to the root densities at ±Q, ±A as can
be seen from (5.98), (5.99)
p  (Q) = 2πρ(Q),

p1 (A) = 2π σ1 (A).

(6.47)

In ﬁgure 6.11 we plot vc,s as functions of the density of electrons n c for several values of u
and zero magnetic ﬁeld B = 0. This parameter regime corresponds to phase IV. For n c → 1
the charge velocity goes to zero, signalling the occurrence of a quantum phase transition to
the Mott insulating phase V at n c = 1, see ﬁgure 6.4. For n c → 0 both velocities approach
zero, corresponding to a situation where the respective ‘Fermi seas’ become very shallow.
At zero density n c = 0 we have a transition to phase I. The spin and charge velocities were
analyzed by H. J. Schulz in his review article [383].

6.6 Susceptibilities
The susceptibilities are obtained by taking derivatives of the magnetization m with respect
to the magnetic ﬁeld and of the density n c with respect to the chemical potential. In phases
I, II and III this is quite simple to do. However, in phases IV and V m and n c are themselves

6.6 Susceptibilities

given in terms of solutions of integral equations and taking derivatives is not an entirely
trivial procedure. Of course one could simply implement the derivatives by taking ﬁnite
differences, e.g.
n c (µ + µ) − n c (µ)
χc B=const ≈
,
(6.48)
µ
but depending on the properties of n c (µ) this can give rather inaccurate results. In order
to obtain good numerical accuracy it is better to express the susceptibilities in terms of
functions that fulﬁl linear integral equations as suggested by F. Woynarovich and K. Penc
in [492]. Here we follow a slightly different path.
6.6.1 Phases I and III
In phases I (empty band) and Phase III (half ﬁlled, spin polarized band) the charge and the
magnetic susceptibility are both zero.
6.6.2 Phase II
In phase II (spin-polarized partially ﬁlled band) the density is given by (6.40) and the
magnetization takes its maximal value m = n c /2. The susceptibilities are
1
χc (µ, B) = 2χs (µ, B) = 3
.
(6.49)
π 4 − (µ + 2u + B)2
6.6.3 Phase IV: matrix notations
In order to simplify the necessary manipulations of coupled integral equations we introduce
a unifying matrix notation. We introduce vectors of integration variables xc,s and integration
boundaries X c,s by
(xc , xs ) = (k, ),

(X c , X s ) = (Q, A).

(6.50)

Next we introduce a vector notation for the root densities and dressed energies as well as
the corresponding driving terms in the integral equations
rc (xc ) = ρ(k),

1
rc(0) (xc ) = 2π
,

rs (xs ) = σ (), rs(0) (xs ) = 0,
ec (xc ) = κ(k),

ec(0) (xc ) = −2 cos(k) − µ − 2u − B,

(6.51)

es (xs ) = ε1 (), es(0) (xs ) = 2B.
Finally, we deﬁne a matrix integral operator with kernels
K cc (xc , yc ) = 0,
K sc (xc , xs ) = a1 (sin(xc ) − xs ),
K cs (xc , xs ) = cos(xc )a1 (sin(xc ) − xs ),
K ss (xs , ys ) = −a2 (xs − ys ).

(6.52)

The calculation of χc,s is naturally split into two parts: we ﬁrst determine the derivatives of
the n c,s with respect to the integration boundaries X c,s and then the derivatives of X c,s with
respect to the magnetic ﬁeld and chemical potential.

Finally we use (6.60) to obtain (6.57).
(ii) Next we determine the derivatives of the integration boundaries X a with respect to µ
and B. To simplify notation we introduce
(µc , µs ) = (µ, B).

(6.66)

The integration boundaries {X a } are ﬁxed in terms of the chemical potentials {µa } by the
condition (6.11), which in matrix notations reads
ea (X a ) = 0.

The magnetic susceptibility at half-ﬁlling was ﬁrst calculated by M. Takahashi in [429,430].
The magnetic susceptibility below half-ﬁlling in zero ﬁeld was studied by H. Shiba in [396],
G. V. Uimin and S. V. Fomichev [463] and by T. Usuki, N. Kawakami and A. Okiji in [468].
The spin and charge susceptibilities for ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld were determined by J. M. P.
Carmelo, P. Horsch and A. A. Ovchinnikov in [78].

6.7 Ground state energy
In general the ground state free energy (6.17) is a complicated function of µ and B (or n c
and m) and has to be calculated from the solutions of the integral equations (6.10). However,
there are several limiting cases in which analytic results are available. At half-ﬁlling (we
set µ = 0) and zero ﬁeld B = 0 the integral equations for the dressed energies (6.10) can
be solved by Fourier transformation as is shown in Appendix 6.B.1. Using these results one
derives the following integral representation for the ground state energy, which was ﬁrst
obtained by E. Lieb and F. Y. Wu [298]

As a function of u the free energy per site has branch points at u = ±i/n, n = 1, 2, . . . [431].
Hence u = 0 is an accumulation point of branch points and perturbative expansions around
the noninteracting theory u = 0 have zero radius of convergence.
The large-u expansion of (6.82) was obtained by M. Takahashi in [431]
f (u, µ = 0, B = 0) = −u − ln(2)

an expansion in powers of n c . We discuss this limit in Appendix 6.B.3. The results are

6.A Numerical solution of integral equations
Here we discuss how to solve the coupled integral equations (6.10) numerically. Let us
rewrite them in a shorthand notation as
T
κ(k) = −2 cos k − µ − 2u − B + K cs
∗ ε1 k ,
T

∗ κ  + K ssT ∗ ε1  .

(6.A.1)

(6.A.2)

The main problem we are facing in solving (6.10) is that the integration boundaries ±Q
and ±A are functions of the magnetic ﬁeld B and the chemical potential µ, and are ﬁxed
by the conditions
κ(±Q) = 0,

ε1 (±A) = 0.

(6.A.3)

We are therefore dealing with a ‘chicken vs egg’ problem: in order to solve the integral
equations (6.A.1), we ﬁrst need to know Q and A for given µ and B. On the other hand, Q
and A are determined as functions of µ and B by the conditions (6.A.3), which involve the
solution of the integral equation (6.A.1). A crude way of solving this problem would be to
proceed as follows.
1. Fix B and µ.
2. Choose values for Q and A.
3. Solve (6.A.1) numerically.
4. Check equations (6.A.3). If they are fulﬁlled within some error we are done. If not go
back to step 2.
We will follow a different path, see e.g. [492]. The key observation is that µ and B
enter the linear integral equations (6.A.1) linearly. We start by choosing the integration
boundaries Q and A. We then determine µ(Q, A) and B(Q, A) from the solutions of a set

Here ξab are the elements of the dressed charge matrix (6.59) and κ̄ and ε̄ fulﬁl the integral
equations for the dressed energies for zero magnetic ﬁeld and zero chemical potential. By
construction we have
κ(k) = κ̄(k) − (µ + B)ξcc (k) + 2Bξsc (k),
ε1 () = ε̄1 () − (µ + B)ξcs () + 2Bξss ().

(6.A.5)

We now solve the three sets of coupled integral equations numerically for ﬁxed values of Q
and A. We then determine the corresponding values of µ and B from the conditions (6.A.3),
which in terms of the quantities Z ca = ξac (Q), Z sa = ξas (A), κ̄(Q), ε̄1 (A) read

(6.A.6)

What remains to be done is to solve (6.A.4) numerically for ﬁxed values of Q and A.
This is easily done by using for example the Numerical Recipes routine fred2 [364]. We
note that in order to use this routine, the coupled integral equations have to be written in
a ‘block-diagonal’ form as we will now explain for the example of coupled equations for
two quantities X (k) and Y ()
X (k) = X 0 (k) + G cc ∗ X k + G cs ∗ Y k ,
Y () = Y0 () + G sc ∗ X  + G ss ∗ Y  ,

6.B Ground state properties in zero magnetic ﬁeld
In absence of a magnetic ﬁeld the integral equations for the dressed energies and root
densities are simpler, because the -integration extends over the entire real axis.1 This
allows us to simplify all integral equations by Fourier transformation. For example, from
the second equation of (6.10) for B = 0, A = ∞ we obtain

For Q = π, i.e. a half ﬁlled band, the integral equations (6.B.3), (6.B.5), can be solved by
Fourier series techniques. However, a simpler way to obtain κ(k) and ε1 () in this case is to
take (6.30) as a starting point. Setting A = ∞ in (6.30) we can calculate ε1 () by Fourier

equations for κ(k) and ε1 () are given by (6.30) and the integration boundary A is very

Equations (6.C.5) can now be solved iteratively: if we know yn−1 () we can determine
yn (). The usefulness of this procedure is based on the fact that the driving terms gn ()
and therefore the solutions yn () become ‘smaller’ (in precisely which sense will become
clear later) as n increases because A is large. Our discussion follows the general procedure
set out in [495] and its implementation for the Hubbard model in [492].

6.C.1 General structure
Let us assume that we know the function yn−1 () and hence the ‘driving term’ gn ().
We deﬁne functions yn ± (ω) which are analytic and the upper and lower half-planes
respectively

1 + exp(−2u|ω|)

(6.C.7)

where gn (ω) is the Fourier transform of gn (). The key idea is now to split (6.C.7) into the
sum of two pieces that are analytic in the upper and lower half-planes respectively. In order
to achieve this goal we will employ the factorisation

the regime U/t  1, see e.g. Refs. [7, 168]. This is done in Section 10.3.

Excited states at zero temperature

In this chapter we determine the spectrum of excited states. We establish that in contrast
to the case of noninteracting electrons u = 0, excitations for u = 0 cannot be described
in terms of electronic degrees of freedom, that is (dressed) electrons and holes. Instead,
low-lying excited states involve collective modes of the spin and charge degrees of freedom
respectively. This phenomenon is known as spin-charge separation.
In Sections 7.2–7.4 we consider the half-ﬁlled band (Phase V), where excitations involving the charge degrees of freedom have a gap, while the spin excitations remain gapless.
In Section 7.6 we study the effects of a magnetic ﬁeld on the excitation spectrum over
the half-ﬁlled ground state (Phase V). In Section 7.7 we discuss the less than half-ﬁlled
band, where both spin and charge degrees of freedom are gapless (Phase IV). Finally, in
Section 7.9 we brieﬂy touch upon the excitation spectrum over the empty ground state
(Phase I).
As we have seen, in Phases IV and V the ground state is described by a ﬁlled Fermi sea
of Bethe ansatz roots k j and a second ﬁlled Fermi sea of roots 1α . On general grounds we
expect low-lying excitations to be described by distributions of roots that are close to the
root distribution of the ground state. An essential point to note is that the ground state energy
scales like the system size L for large L, whereas the excited state we are considering differ
in energy from the ground state only by O(1).
Low-lying excited states are Bethe ansatz states with given, small numbers of holes in
the distributions of k’s and ’s and given, small numbers of ‘extra’ roots k j , nβ and  nγ .
Here small means that we consider a ground state with N electrons and M down spins and
excited states with N + n electrons and M + m down spins such that

=0,

(7.1)

The main idea behind our construction of excited states is to make full use of the results
of the zero-temperature limit of the TBA equations. In particular, as we have seen, the TBA
analysis tells us which dressed energies and dressed momenta are non-vanishing at T = 0.
This then tells us how small changes of the root distribution of the ground state will affect
the energy and momentum.

7.1 A point of reference: noninteracting electrons
Before turning to the excitation spectrum for the Hubbard model let us recall brieﬂy the
situation in the absence of interactions, i.e. u = 0. In momentum space the Hamiltonian
can be written as (5.6)
 π

where ε0 (k) = −2 cos(k) − µ − B and ε0 (k) = −2 cos(k) − µ + B are the bare energies
for electrons with spin up and down respectively and ñ σ (k) is the number operator of
electrons with spin σ and momentum k. The ground state is obtained by ﬁlling all negative
energy states, see Section 6.1. In the general case this corresponds to ﬁlling two Fermi
seas with Fermi momenta k F,σ given by (6.2). For deﬁniteness we consider the case where
0 < k F,σ < π in what follows. It is easy to see that
[ñ σ (k), H] = 0 ,

(7.3)

which implies that the number of electrons with given spin and momentum is a conserved
quantity. This in turn allows us to construct excited eigenstates of the Hamiltonian by adding
electrons with given momentum and spin to the ground state or alternatively removing them
from the Fermi sea.
7.1.1 ‘Single-particle’ excitations
The simplest excitations over the ground state are obtained by adding (‘particle’ excitation)
or removing (‘hole’ excitation) one electron. Particle excitations have charge −e, spin σ

7.2 Zero magnetic ﬁeld and half-ﬁlled band
In this section we determine the spectrum of low-lying excitation in the half-ﬁlled repulsive
Hubbard model in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld. We will see that any low-lying state can
be thought of as a scattering state of an even number of elementary excitations [120, 121].
7.2.1 Elementary excitations
There are two different types of elementary excitations:
r Gapped, spinless excitations carrying charge ∓e. They are sometimes called antiholons

and holons respectively. The dressed energy Eh̄,h (k) and dressed momentum Ph̄,h (k) of
these excitations are given in (7.8). They transform under the spin- 12 respresentation of
the η-pairing SU(2) symmetry and hence the ( 12 , 0) representation of SU (2) × SU (2).
r Gapless, charge-neutral excitations carrying spin ± 1 . Such excitations are called spinons.
2
Their dressed energy Es̄,s () and dressed momentum Ps̄,s () are given in (7.8). They
transform under the spin-1/2 respresentation of the spin SU(2) symmetry and hence the
(0, 12 ) respresentation of SU (2) × SU (2).
It is important to distinguish these elementary excitations from ‘physical’ excitations,
which are the permitted combinations of elementary excitations. In other words, not any
combination of elementary excitations is allowed, but only those consistent with the selection rules (4.44).
We introduce the following terminology: we call the set {Me , Mn , Mn |n = 1 . . . ∞}
of the numbers of real k’s, -strings of length n and k--strings of length n occupation
numbers of the corresponding excitation. This is in contrast to our usage of the term quantum
# ηz
numbers, which is reserved for the eigenvalues of energy, momentum, S z , S2 = S# · S,
and η2 = η# · η#. In what follows we will establish the following.
Classiﬁcation of Excitations
All low-lying excited states of the half-ﬁlled repulsive Hubbard model are scattering states
of an even number of elementary excitations. The excitation energies and momenta are

(7.8)
The energies of the elementary excitations are plotted as functions of their momenta in
ﬁgures 7.2 and 7.3. The antiholon energy has a minimum at Ph̄ = π2 and the holon energy
at Ph = − π2 . Both holon and antiholon momenta cover the entire Brillouin zone. The
momentum of the spinon varies in the interval [0, π ] and covers only half the Brillouin
zone. The low-energy modes occur at Ps = 0 and Ps = π .
The classiﬁcation of excitations was ﬁrst proposed in [120, 121]. An important consequence of this classiﬁcation is that at half ﬁlling spin-charge separation on the level of the
quantum numbers of elementary excitations holds not only at low energies, but extends
to any ﬁnite energy in the thermodynamic limit. On the other hand we will see that at
ﬁnite energies the scattering matrix between holons and spinons becomes nontrivial, which
establishes the presence of interactions between them.

Given that all elementary excitations carry deﬁnite SU (2) × SU (2) quantum numbers,
all excited states can be characterized by SU (2) × SU (2) quantum numbers as well. More
precisely, as all excited states contain an even number of elementary excitations, they are
classiﬁed by S O(4) = SU (2) × SU (2)/Z2 quantum numbers. For example, in the twoparticle sector we can consider scattering states of two spinons, two (anti)holons or one
spinon and one (anti)holon. Our classiﬁcation of excitations stated above then tells us that
there are the following excitations:
two spinons

(0, 12 ) ⊗ (0, 12 ) = (0, 1) ⊕ (0, 0) ,

two (anti)holons ( 12 , 0) ⊗ ( 12 , 0) = (1, 0) ⊕ (0, 0) ,
spinon − (anti)holon

(0, 12 ) ⊗ ( 12 , 0) = ( 12 , 12 ) .

(7.9)

In Section 7.2.4 we explicitly construct the highest-weight states of all these multiplets from
the Bethe ansatz.
Before turning to the explicit construction of low-lying excited states over the ground
state and the proof of our classiﬁcation of excitations, we ﬁrst derive explicit expressions
for the dressed energies and momenta for the half-ﬁlled band in the absence of a magnetic
ﬁeld. As we have seen above, at half ﬁlling the chemical potential is not ﬁxed but can vary
between 0 and µ− . For deﬁniteness we choose µ = 0 in what follows.
The integration boundaries in the integral equations for the dressed energies in this case are
Q = π and A = ∞. The integral equations for the dressed energies (5.103), root densities
(5.105) and momenta (5.98)–(5.101) at T = 0 can be simpliﬁed further. For the dressed
energies the easiest way of seeing this is the following. Our starting point are the coupled
integral equations (5.83)–(5.86). Inserting (5.83) into (5.85) for n = 1 we obtain a linear
integral equation involving only ε1 (), which can be solved by Fourier transformation.
Inserting the result of this calculation into (5.83) we obtain κ(k). All other dressed energies

can be calculated once ε1 () and κ(k) are known. We ﬁnd

where we have used (17.15) to obtain the last identity. In ﬁgure 7.4 we plot the results
(7.10) and (7.12) for κ(k) and p(k) for three different values of u. We see that p(k) is
a monotonically increasing function of k and varies in the interval [−π, π]. The dressed
energy κ(k) is always strictly negative, but κ(±π ) is very close to zero for small values
of u.

Fig. 7.6. Dressed energies κ(k) and ε1 () as functions of the dressed momenta p(k) and p1 ()

In ﬁgure 7.5 we plot the results (7.10) and (7.12) for ε1 () and p1 () on the interval
 ∈ [−5, 5] for three different values of u. We see that the dressed momentum p1 () is
a monotonically increasing function of  and varies in the interval [− π2 , π2 ]. The dressed
energy ε1 () tends to zero for  → ±∞. By inverting the functions p(k) and p1 () we
can eliminate the auxiliary parameters k and  and plot the dressed energies as functions
of the respective dressed momenta. This is done in ﬁgure 7.6. We note that the curves for
u = 0.25 and u = 0.025 are very close to one another.
From our knowledge of the dressed energies and dressed momenta we can infer several
important properties. Firstly, we see that most of the dressed energies and momenta are
identically zero. This tells us that adding the corresponding type of Bethe ansatz root to the
ground state distribution does not change the total energy and momentum. In other words,
these roots merely control degeneracies of the spectrum. The only nontrivial nonvanishing
dressed energies and momenta are the ones corresponding to the roots that make up the two
Fermi seas of the ground state. This tells us that making a hole at position kh in the distribution
of k’s costs energy −κ(kh ) and adds − p(kh ) to the total momentum. Similarly, making a

Fig. 7.7. Example of the extra contribution to the momentum: in the ground state the I j ’s are half-odd
integers and are distributed symmetrically around zero. In the excited state we have two holes, which
contribute to the momentum according to their positions. In addition there is an extra contribution of
π to the momentum because in the excited state the integers I j are distributed asymmetrically around
zero.

hole at position h in the distribution of 1 ’s costs energy −ε1 (h ) and adds − p1 (h ) to
the total momentum. A special case are k- strings. They have zero dressed energy and
therefore do not represent ‘dynamical’ excitations but contribute a constant π (n + 1) to the
momentum. There is one subtlety concerning the momentum. If the occupation numbers of
a given state are such that the I j ’s are integers, there is an additional, constant contribution
of π to the momentum. This is because the vacancies for integer I j ’s are by deﬁnition
asymmetric
L
L
< Ij ≤ .
2
2

(7.13)

If all vacancies were occupied, the momentum would be equal to π . This can be most easily
seen by using the expression (5.97) for the momentum. When we calculate the difference of
momenta between a given excited state and the ground state, we have to take into account
this constant contribution in addition to the contribution of the holes in the distribution of
I j ’s. This subtlety is illustrated in ﬁgure 7.7.
An important point to keep in mind here is that of course not any combination of holes
in the ground state distribution and any set of additional roots corresponding to k- strings
and longer  strings is permitted, but only those that fulﬁl the selection rules (4.44). As
an example we shall consider low-lying excited states containing only two elementary
excitations in Section 7.2.4.

7.2.2 Holon and spinon band widths
From our knowledge of the dressed energies and momenta we may infer the ‘band widths’
of the elementary holon and spinon excitations. It is clear from Fig.7.4 that the holon ‘band
width’ is simply
Wh = κ(π ) − κ(0) = 4 ,

(7.14)

Reinstituting the hopping amplitude we ﬁnd that the holon ‘band width’ is independent of
U and equal to 4t.

Using (7.10) and (7.12) we obtain integral representations for the derivatives. The leading

7.2.4 Two-particle sector
In this subsection we construct all excited states that contain only two elementary excitations.
These can be either (anti)holons or spinons.
Charge Triplet Excitation This is a gapped excitation with occupation numbers M1 =
L
− 1 and Me = L − 2. This results in quantum numbers S z = 0, η z = −1. As we are
2
constructing a Bethe ansatz state we can use the highest-weight theorem to infer the quantum
numbers S2 = 0 and η2 = 2. The resulting S O(4) representation is thus (1, 0). The allowed
ranges of the integers I j and half-odd integers Jα1 are

Hence there are L2 − 1 vacancies for the L2 − 1 1α ’s and L vacancies for the L − 2 k’s. As
a result we are left with two holes in the distribution of k’s. Let us denote their positions by
k1 and k2 respectively. The two holes are the only dynamical objects and carry an energy
and momentum equal to
E CT (k1 , k2 ) = −κ(k1 ) − κ(k2 ) = Eh (k1 ) + Eh (k2 ) ,
PCT (k1 , k2 ) = − p(k1 ) − p(k2 ) + π = Ph (k1 ) + Ph (k2 ) ,

(7.29)

where κ(k) and p(k) are given by (7.10) and (7.12) respectively and Eh , Ph by (7.8). The extra
contribution of π to the momentum arises because the I j ’s are integers (see the discussion
above ﬁgure 7.7).2 The charge triplet excitation has a minimal gap of 2, where  is given
by (7.18).
The full SO(4) multiplet is obtained by acting repeatedly with η† on the lowest-weight
state we just constructed. One subtlety to keep in mind is that this action shifts the total
momentum by π, see (2.88). As a result the momentum of the η z = 0 state of the chargetriplet is − p(k1 ) − p(k2 ).
Charge Singlet Excitation This excitation has occupation numbers M1 = L2 − 1, M1 = 1
and Me = L − 2. The corresponding quantum numbers are S z = 0, η z = 0 and by the

We assume throughout this chapter that L = 2 × odd integer.

which implies that we again have two holes at positions k1,2 in the distribution of k’s. In
addition we now have a single k- string at a position  , which however carries zero
dressed energy as ε1 ( ) ≡ 0 by (7.10), and only contributes a constant p1 ( ) = 2π to the
momentum as follows from (7.12). Therefore energy and momentum of the charge singlet
excitation are given by
E CS (k1 , k2 ) = −κ(k1 ) − κ(k2 ) = Eh (k1 ) + Eh̄ (k2 ) ,
PCS (k1 , k2 ) = (− p(k1 ) − p(k2 )) mod (2π ) = Ph (k1 ) + Ph̄ (k2 ).

(7.31)

The charge singlet excitation is degenerate with the η z = 0 state of the charge triplet.
One can easily check that there are no other excitations involving only two holes in the
Fermi sea of k’s and no holes in the Fermi sea of 1 ’s. The charge triplet excitation as well
as other excited states involving k- strings were ﬁrst studied by F. Woynarovich [481,482].
Spin Triplet Excitation This gapless excitation has occupation numbers M1 = L2 − 1, and
Me = L and quantum numbers S z = 1, η z = 0, S2 = 2, η2 = 0. The corresponding S O(4)
representation is (0, 1). The ranges of the integers I j and half-odd integers Jα1 are

The extra contribution of π to the momentum arises because the I j ’s are integers (see the
discussion above).
The spin triplet excitation in the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model is very similar to the spin triplet
Heisenberg spin- 12 antiferromagnet [132, 333]. This is precisely what one expects on the
basis of the mapping of the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model on the Heisenberg model discussed in
Appendix 2.A. The single-spinon dispersion was ﬁrst constructed by A. A. Ovchinnikov
[352] and reexamined by T.C. Choy and W. Young in [84]. A detailed analysis of spin
excitations was carried out by F. Woynarovich in [486] and by means of functional relations
by A. Klümper, A. Schadschneider and J. Zittartz [258]. The spin triplet excitation can be
probed by inelastic Neutron Scattering Experiments.
Spin Singlet Excitation There is exactly one other excitation involving two holes in the 
sea and no holes in the k sea. Its occupation numbers are Me = L, M1 = L2 − 2 and M2 = 1
and the corresponding ranges of the integers I j , Jα1 and J12 are

The quantum numbers are S z = 0, η z = 0, S2 = 0, η2 = 0 so that we are dealing with
another S O(4) singlet (0, 0). Energy and momentum of the spin singlet excitation are
degenerate with those of the spin triplet
E SS (1 , 2 ) = −ε1 (1 ) − ε1 (2 ) = Es (1 ) + Es̄ (2 ) ,
PSS (1 , 2 ) = − p1 (1 ) − p1 (2 ) + π = Ps (1 ) + Ps̄ (2 ).

in [485].

Spin-Charge scattering states The last type of two-particle excitation is gapped and has
the quantum numbers of a physical electron or hole. It involves one hole in each of the k
and  seas. Its occupation numbers are Me = L − 1, M1 = L2 − 1 and it has the quantum
numbers of a hole (a missing electron) S z = 12 , η z = − 12 , S2 = 34 , η2 = 34 . This corresponds
to the ( 12 , 12 ) respresentation of S O(4). The ranges of the integers I j and Jα1 are

The energy and momentum of the spin-charge scattering states are given by

PSC (, k) = − p1 () − p(k) + π = Ps () + Ph (k).

(7.37)

The extra contribution of π to the momentum arises because the I j ’s are integers (see the
discussion above). The spin-charge scattering state has a minimal gap of  (7.18). This
type of excitation is of particular importance for photoemission experiments like Angle
Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) [71, 91], where an electron is removed
and the system gets excited into a state characterized by the quantum numbers S z = ± 12 ,
η z = − 12 . The fact that there are no single-particle excitations with the quantum numbers
of an electron is dramatically different from the case of noninteracting electrons. The spincharge scattering state was ﬁrst constructed by F. Woynarovich in [485].
7.2.5 2N particle sector

(see also [258,481,482,485,486]). It is convenient to ﬁx the occupation numbers as follows:

(7.47)

For L = 2 × odd integer, the case we have been discussing, this is the same as the right hand
side of (7.46). This proves that (7.8) is indeed the correct expression for the momenta of
the elementary excitations in the sense that in order for the total momentum to be additive,
the constant (spectral parameter independent) contributions must be chosen exactly as
in (7.8).
In order to prove our classiﬁcation of elementary excitations we still have to show that
the total number N (Nh , Mh , S z , η z ) of excited SO(4) lowest-weight3 states with Nh holes in
the distribution of k’s and Mh holes in the distribution of 1 ’s with ﬁxed quantum numbers
S z and η z is predicted correctly.
According to our classiﬁcation, this number is simply equal to the number of lowestweight scattering states of Nh holons and Mh spinons with the given values for S z ≥ 0 and
η z ≤ 0. Therefore N (Nh , Mh , S z , η z ) can be expressed as a product
N (Nh , η z ) N (Mh , S z ) ,

(7.48)

where N (Nh , η z ) is the number of lowest-weight states with a given η z in the Nh -fold tensor
product of spin- 12 representations of the η-pairing SU (2) and similarly N (Mh , S z ) is the
number of highest-weight states with a given S z in the Mh -fold tensor product of spin- 12
representations of the spin-SU (2). From representation theory of SU (2) we can infer that

where Cba are binomial coefﬁcients. Let us now reproduce this result directly from the

Recall that ‘SO(4) lowest weight state’ means that the state is a lowest weight state with respect to the η-pairing SU(2) and a
highest-weight state with respect to the spin-SU(2) symmetry algebra.

These sums are precisely of the same structure as the ones we encountered in establishing
the completeness of the Bethe ansatz in Chapter 4.B. Indeed, the ﬁrst factor in (7.52)
is of the same form as (4.B.8). The second factor can be brought to the same form by
a simple relabelling of the summation variables Mm = M̃m−1 for m ≥ 2 and using that
tn+1 m+1 = tnm + 2. Using (4.B.8) in both factors we obtain
N (Nh , Mh , S z , η z ) = N (Nh , η z ) N (Mh , S z ) ,

(7.53)

where N (Nh , η z ) and N (Mh , S z ) are given by (7.49). The number of excited states obtained directly from the Bethe ansatz is thus indeed identical to the one obtained from our
classiﬁcation of general excited states.
7.3 Root-density formalism
There are several ways of constructing the ground state and low-lying excited states in
a Bethe ansatz solvable model. In this section we dicuss a method widely used in the
literature. We choose to call it the ‘root-density formalism’ as the fundamental objects
are distribution functions for Bethe ansatz roots in the thermodynamic limit. Historically
the ﬁrst to use this method was Hulthén [207] in his study of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic chain. For the Hubbard model the method was used in many works on the
zero temperature excitation spectrum [88, 352, 481, 482, 486]. The root density formalism

226

Excited states at zero temperature

is useful for determining scattering phase shifts of elementary excitations, see Section 7.4.
Our discussion is based on F. Woynarovich’s work [481, 482, 486].
Let us recall the notation Me = N − 2M  for the number of k’s that are not associated
with k- strings. For deﬁniteness we consider the case where the lattice length is L =
2 × odd integer.

1α+1 − 1α = O(L −1 ) .

What about the equations for the holes? All they do is ﬁx the relation between the
integer or half-odd integer numbers characterizing the positions of the holes and the corh
responding spectral parameters knh and m
. As long as we are content with parametrizing the positions of the holes by the spectral parameters we do not have to solve these
equations.
So far our discussion has been very general. In order to see how to utilize equations (7.78)
and (7.80) let us reconsider all excitations involving two elementary excitations. Apart
from rederiving our previous results for the energies and momenta of these excited states
we will obtain results that will be used to determine the two-particle scattering matrix in
Section 7.4.
7.3.3 Charge singlet excitation
We start with the charge singlet excitation, which we recall is characterized by occupation
numbers Me = L − 2, M1 = 1 and M1 = L2 − 1. Both the I j ’s and the Jα1 ’s are half-odd
integers whereas the single J  11 is an integer with

densities of the half-ﬁlled ground state (7.63) and are thus given by (7.11). The densities
ρCS (k) and σCS () satisfy the following coupled integral equations

7.4 Scattering matrix
So far we have determined the dispersions and the SU (2) × SU (2) quantum numbers of the
elementary excitations in the half-ﬁlled Hubbard chain. In this section we go one step further
and determine the two-particle scattering matrix (S-matrix), which gives us information on
how elementary excitations interact in a given excited state. The S-matrix also determines
the low-temperature thermodynamics in relativistic integrable theories [505]. The scattering
of elementary excitations in the half-ﬁlled Hubbard chain is of a very special kind: it is
factorizable [52, 322, 339, 493, 503]. The scattering process of 2N particles is described
as follows: at t = −∞ 2N particles with momenta p1 > p2 > . . . > p2N are arranged in
our one-dimensional space such that x1  x2  . . .  x2N , i.e. the fastest particle is the
leftmost one and the slowest the rightmost one. In the interaction region the particles collide
two at a time. The set of momenta and SU (2) ⊗ SU (2) quantum numbers are conserved in
each collision: the scattering is completely elastic. Two-particle scattering processes can be
represented graphically as in ﬁgure 7.12(a). The corresponding S-matrix element is denoted
by
Sαβ11αβ22 ( p1 , p2 ).

(7.119)

After N (2N − 1) pair collisions the particles are arranged along the spatial direction in order
of increasing momenta, i.e. the fastest particle is now the rightmost one. In the ﬁnal state
of scattering at t = ∞ we have x1  x2  . . .  x2N . A four-particle scattering process
is depicted in ﬁgure 7.12(b). The factorization of the scattering implies that the N -particle
S-matrix is expressed as a product over two-particle S-matrices

The same scattering process can be represented by different diagrams as is shown in ﬁgure
7.13 for the example of three-particle scattering. As they describe the same process, the
corresponding products of two-particle S-matrices must be the same. This condition is
equivalent to a Yang-Baxter equation for the two-particle S-matrices

In quantum mechanical scattering theory the S-matrix can be extracted from the asymptotics of the wave-function of the scattering state [283]. The boundary conditions of the
quantum mechanical problem are free. This is in contrast to the periodic boundary conditions imposed in the Bethe ansatz solution, which complicates the problem of determining
phase shifts. In Ref. [266] V. E. Korepin developed a general method for calculating the
exact two-particle S-matrix directly from the Bethe ansatz equations. It is based on the fact
that the Bethe ansatz equations have an interpretation in terms of scattering of particles.
The same holds true for the Bethe ansatz equations describing low-lying excitations over
the true ground state, and using this interpretation it is possible to calculate the phase shifts
for excited states. Korepin’s method was subsequently applied to many integrable models.
In recent years these methods have been generalized to accommodate open boundary conditions [104, 116, 185]. It also has been shown by direct calculation that the multi-particle
scattering factorizes [103].
An approach equivalent to Korepin’s was suggested by N. Andrei and C. Destri in [19].
It is based on the relation of the scattering phase shift to the quantization condition for the
momentum in a ﬁnite volume. Consider the scattering of two particles with momenta p1 and

238

p2 respectively. In a ﬁnite volume L the scattering phase shift δ 12 for scattering of particle
1 on particle 2 is given by

(7.122)

where n is an integer. We have already seen an example of this when we derived the
Bethe ansatz equations in Chapter 3.2. In what follows we will determine the twoparticle scattering phase shifts of excitations over the half-ﬁlled ground state by exploiting the relation (7.122). We will make extensive use of the results for the respective excited states obtained in subsections 7.3.3–7.3.7 within the framework of the root density
formalism.

7.4.1 Charge sector
Let us begin with the phase shift of the charge singlet excitation (see subsection 7.3.3 above).
Our starting point is Takahashi’s equation for the ﬁrst hole, which we take to describe a
holon elementary excitation

where Ph (k1h ) = π2 − p(k1h ) is the dressed momentum of the holon (7.8), (7.12) and where
we have used (7.84) and (7.11). We see that (7.123) is precisely of the form (7.122)! This
12
observation allows us to determine the charge-singlet phase shift δCS
. We have to be a bit
h
careful, because I1 is actually a half-odd integer number, which gives an extra contribution
of π to the phase shift. Using the expressions (7.87) for σCS and (7.92) for  11 and the
integral (17.18) we obtain the following result

(7.125)

The condition k12 > 0 is necessary for scattering to occur. The analogous calculation for
the charge triplet is easily done using the explicit results for the root densities (7.100) and
(7.101). I1h is now an integer, so that there is no extra contribution to the phase shift. We

(7.126)

Having determined the phase shifts we are now in a position to write down the two-particle
12
12
scattering matrices. The scattering phases exp(iδCS
) and exp(iδCT
) are the eigenvalues of
the two-particle scattering matrix in the η-pairing singlet and triplet sectors respectively. In
total there are four two-particle states in the charge sector: holon-holon, antiholon-antiholon
and two holon-antiholon states. We introduce bases for the initial (in) and ﬁnal (out) states
of the scattering process in the usual way
|k1 , k2 in
α1 α2 ,

|k1 , k2 out
α1 α2 ,

k1 > k2 ,

α j ∈ {h, h̄}.

(7.127)

Here α = h, h̄ is an η-pairing SU(2) index corresponding to holon and antiholon respectively. The ‘in-states’ (‘out-states’) correspond to an ordering of the particles by decreasing
(increasing) momentum. This means that for ‘in-states’ the left-most particle has the largest
momentum, the second particle from the left has the second largest momentum and so on.
The S-matrix elements are deﬁned by

(7.135)

The S-matrix (7.134) was ﬁrst derived from the factorization conditions [237, 503] by B.
Berg et al. in [54, 55].

7.4.2 Spin sector
Let us now turn to scattering in the spin sector. Let us ﬁrst determine the phase shift for the
spin singlet excitation (see subsection 7.3.5 above). Takahashi’s equation for the ﬁrst hole
in the distribution of the 1α ’s reads

singlet excitation as

where the extra π arises because J1,2

now can write down the two particle S-matrix in the spin sector by repeating the steps we

with S z = ± 12 we can cast the result in the following form

where α j , β j = s, s̄. The S-matrix (7.142) is again SU(2) invariant as is required by the
spin-rotational symmetry. As a function of the ‘uniformising’ spectral parameter, the Smatrix (7.142) is the same as in the spin- 12 Heisenberg model [132] and in the Kondo
model [18, 20, 460].

7.4.3 Scattering of spin and charge
Finally let us consider scattering of spinons and (anti)holons. The phase-shifts can be
extracted from the spin-charge scattering state dicsussed in subsection 7.3.7. The equation
for the hole in the distribution of the k j ’s is

δSC

(7.144)

where the dressed momentum Ph (k h ) of the holon is given by (7.8). Inserting (7.143) into
(7.144) and then using (7.115) and (7.116) we obtain the following result for the phase shift

For scattering to occur we need

(7.146)

By construction the S-matrix describing scattering of a spinon on a holon is diagonal (the
SO(4) quantum numbers cannot change during the scattering process). We can express it
in the form

The S-matrix for the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model in zero magnetic ﬁeld was determined
in [120, 121] and for a less than half-ﬁlled band in [18].

7.5 ‘Physical’ Bethe ansatz equations
Let us return to the general excited state discussed in 7.3.2: there are Nh and Mh holes in
the distributions of k’s and 1α ’s respectively, Ml roots lα (l ≥ 2) and Mn roots  nα . Using
the formalism developed above, it is possible to derive a set of equations for the spectral
parameters of the holes and extra roots. These equations are the analog of Takahashi’s
equations, which we recall describe excited states over the reference state of the Bethe
ansatz, the empty lattice. The equations we will derive now describe excited states over
the true ground state of the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model. For this reason they are known as
‘physical Bethe ansatz equations’. Our discussion follows Ref. [490].
The root densities describing a general excitation over the half-ﬁlled ground state are
given in terms of the integral equations (7.78). The solution of these equations is

7.6 Finite magnetic ﬁeld and half-ﬁlled band
Let us now consider the excitation spectrum at half ﬁlling in the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld. We set the chemical potential equal to zero, µ = 0 and constrain our discussion to
Phase V, i.e. values of B such that

B < B0 = 2 1 + u 2 − 2u .

(7.158)

The dressed momenta can again be calculated from the root densities by (5.98)–(5.101).
The dispersions κ( p) and ε1 ( p1 ) are shown in ﬁgure 7.14 for u = 0.25 and several values
of the applied magnetic ﬁeld.
In a weak ﬁeld, the dispersions are very close to the zero ﬁeld results shown in ﬁgure 7.6.
Increasing the value B leads to relatively small changes in κ( p), whereas ε1 ( p1 ) is pushed
to higher energies and covers a larger momentum range. For B = 1.5, which is close to the
saturation ﬁeld for u = 0.25, B0 ≈ 1.56155, the momentum range in which ε1 ( p1 ) ≤ 0 has
almost shrunk to zero. In ﬁgure 7.15 we plot ε2 ( p2 ) for u = 0.25 and several values of the
applied magnetic ﬁeld. We see that increasing the ﬁeld pushes the dispersion up to higher
5

We still use the convention (5.95).

energies while increasing the momentum range covered. In the limit B → 0, the dispersion
collapses to zero. The dispersions εn ( pn ) of longer -strings look similar.
In the following discussion of the ground state and excitations we concentrate on regular
Bethe states. As usual further states are obtained by acting with the SO(4) raising and
lowering operators. The magnetic ﬁeld breaks the spin rotational symmetry and as a result
acting with the spin lowering operator S− on a regular Bethe state with energy E (and S z
eigenvalue different from zero) gives an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with energy E + 2B.
7.6.1 Ground state
The ground state is characterized by the occupation numbers Me = L, M1 = MGS < L/2.
We furthermore take MGS to be an odd integer. As a result the I j ’s are half-odd integers and
the Jα1 ’s are integers. The quantum numbers of the ground state are

7.6.2 Excitations of the spin degrees of freedom
Let us ﬁrst consider excitations involving only the spin sector. As we will see these are
quite similar to the excitation of the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain in a magnetic
ﬁeld [235, 333, 447].
δS z = 1 ‘Two-Spinon’ Excitation
This excitation has occupation numbers M1 = MGS − 1 and Me = L. Hence it has quantum numbers S z = (L − 2MGS )/2 + 1 and η z = 0. Relative to the ground state we have
δS z = 1. The ranges of the integers I j and half-odd integers Jα1 are

ground state there are two additional holes. We ﬁrst consider the case, where the half-odd

Fig. 7.18. Upper and lower boundaries of the S z = 1 two-spinon continuum for u = 0.25 and

Here the superscript indicates that we are considering a δS z = 1 excitation and the extra
contribution of π to the momentum arises because the I j ’s are integers (see the discussion
above ﬁgure 7.7). In particular for weak ﬁelds this excitation is very similar to the spintriplet excitation6 and in the limit B → 0 goes over in the latter. On the basis of this
similarity we will call the two elementary excitations making up the δS z = 1 state ‘spinons’.
In ﬁgure 7.18(a) we show the lower and upper boundaries of the ‘two-hole’ scattering
continuum for u = 0.25 and B = 0.5. We see that the excitation only exists in part of
the Brillouin zone: there are no states at small momentum. As B increases the continuum
occupies a smaller and smaller
√ part of the Brillouin zone until it altogether disappears
at the saturation ﬁeld B0 = 2 1 + u 2 − 2u, where the ground state becomes fully spin
polarized.
It is by no means necessary to choose the distribution of Jα1 in the way we have done, i.e.
such that we obtain two holes. This is contrast to the zero ﬁeld case, where we necessarily
end up with two holes. An equally valid distribution of half-odd integers Jα1 is shown in
ﬁgure 7.19. Now we have one hole at J h and one particle at J p , with corresponding spectral
parameters h and  p . By construction J p,h have ranges

The upper and lower boundaries of this ‘hole-particle’ continuum are shown in ﬁgure 7.20.
It is clear from its construction that this excitation disappears in both limits B → 0 and
B → B0 .
By construction the particle-hole excitation is two-parametric. However, it is perhaps
more natural to consider it as a special case of a four-parametric excitation. In ﬁgure 7.21
we have replotted the distribution of the Jα1 ’s by choosing the ‘Fermi integer’ to be M2GS
rather than MGS2 −2 . In this way of looking at things the particle-hole state corresponds to
the special limit of a three-hole one-particle excitation, where two of the holes are located
at the two ‘Fermi points’, i.e. their associated spectral parameters are ±A. Now we may

The particle-particle state may alternatively be considered as a special case of a (four-hole

δS z = −1 ‘Two-Spinon’ Excitation
Let us now consider states with occupation numbers M1 = MGS + 1 and Me = L. The
quantum numbers are S z = (L − 2MGS )/2 − 1 and η z = 0. Relative to the ground state we
have δS z = −1. The ranges of the integers I j and half-odd integers Jα1 are

are shown in ﬁgure 7.24.
δS z = 0 ‘Particle-Hole’ Excitation
Given that the Fermi sea of 1α is only partially ﬁlled, we may construct a ‘particle-hole’
excitation by the process described in ﬁgure 7.25. By construction this state has the same
quantum numbers as the ground state, but describes a two-parametric excitation of the spin
degrees of freedom. Denoting the spectral parameters corresponding to the ‘particle’ and
‘hole’ as  p and h respectively, we have

We note that this excitation exists only in a nonzero magnetic ﬁeld and disappears in the
limit B → 0. In ﬁgure 7.26 we plot the boundaries of the continuum of states belonging to
the particle-hole excitation. We note that the only difference to the δS z = 1 particle-hole
excitation is a shift of momentum by π . We expect the particle-hole excitation to dominate
the ‘longitudinal’ spin response (i.e. the zz-component of the dynamical structure factor) at
low energies of the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model in a sufﬁciently strong magnetic ﬁeld.

δS z = −1 ‘Magnon’ Excitation
Another state with δS z = −1 is obtained by the choice of occupation numbers Me = L,
M1 = MGS − 1 and M2 = 1. Now both the I j ’s and Jα1 ’s are half-odd integers and J12 is an
integer. We ﬁnd

root the number of holes is the same as in the ground state. Hence we choose
Jα1 = −

2

α = 1, . . . , MGS − 1,

(7.172)

and do not associate any excitation with the Fermi sea of the 1α ’s. This implies that the
excitation described by the above occupation numbers is one-parametric with energy and
momentum given by
E Mag () = ε2 () ,
PMag () = p2 ().

(7.173)

We note that this excitation is gapped (see Appendix 7.B)
E Mag () ≥ ε2 (0) ≥ 2B .

(7.174)

The dispersion for the magnon excitation for u = 0.25 and three values of B is shown in
ﬁgure 7.15. An interesting question is why the magnon excitation is stable and does not
decay into two S z = −1/2 spinons. It turns out that the magnon dispersion is just very
slightly higher in energy than the δS z = −1 two-spinon continuum, which is shown in
ﬁgure 7.24.

252

Excited states at zero temperature

δS z = 0 ‘Two-Spinon-Magnon’ Excitation Let us now consider the analog of the spinsinglet excitation (7.35) in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The occupation numbers
are Me = L, M1 = MGS − 2, M2 = 1, resulting in the I j ’s being integers and |Jα1 | ≤
1
(L − MGS − 1), |Jα2 | ≤ 12 (L − 2MGS ). This means that we have two extra holes in the
2
distribution of Jα1 ’s and the excitation is three-parametric, as there is a ﬁnite range for the
integer J12 and concomittantly also for the corresponding rapidity  of the 2-string. Let us
h
denote the integers corresponding to the extra holes by J1,2
and consider only the case
h
|J1,2
|≤

MGS − 1
.
2

(7.175)

h
Then the dynamical degrees of freedom are parametrized by the spectral parameters 1,2
of
1
the holes in the distribution of the Jα ’s and  of the extra 2-string. Energy and momentum
are

E 2sM (1h , 2h , ) = −ε1 (1h ) − ε1 (2h ) + ε2 () ,
P2sM (1h , 2h , ) = − p1 (1h ) − p1 (2h ) + p2 () + π.

(7.176)

When the magnetic ﬁeld becomes small, the range of p2 () as well as the energy ε2 ()
collapses to zero and we recover the spin-singlet excitation discussed before, see equation
(7.35). The cases where instead of having two holes in the distribution of Jα1 we have a
particle and a hole or two particles can be treated in the same way as for the δS z = 1
two-spinon excitation.

7.6.3 Excitations involving the charge sector
Charge Singlet Excitation This excitation has occupation numbers M1 = MGS − 1, M1 = 1
and Me = L − 2. The corresponding quantum numbers are S z = (L − 2MGS )/2, η z = 0,
i.e. the same as for the ground state. The ranges of the half-odd integers I j , half-odd integers

in the distribution of k’s. In the
which implies that we have two holes at positions k1,2
1
distribution of  ’s there is one less vacancy than in the ground state, but also one less root.
Hence no degrees of freedom are excited here and the distribution of Jα1 remains symmetric
around zero. We also have a single k- string at a position  , which however carries zero
dressed energy as ε1 ( ) ≡ 0 by (7.10), and only contributes a constant p1 ( ) = 2π to the
momentum as follows from (7.12). Therefore energy and momentum of the charge singlet
excitation are given by

E CS (k1h , k2h ) = −κ(k1h ) − κ(k2h ) ,
PCS (k1h , k2h ) = − p(k1h ) − p(k2h ) mod (2π ).

(7.178)

This excitation is very similar to the charge-singlet in zero magnetic ﬁeld, see ﬁgure (7.9).

7.7 Zero magnetic ﬁeld and less than half-ﬁlled band

253

Spin-Charge Scattering State Finally, let us consider the spin-charge scattering state with
occupation numbers Me = L − 1, M1 = MGS − 1. The differences in quantum numbers
compared to the ground state are δS z = 12 and η z = − 12 so that the excited state corresponds
to the removal of one electron from the ground state. There are L vacancies for the integers
I j so there we have one hole at position k h in the distribution of the k j ’s. We have the
same number of vacancies for the integers Jα1 as in the ground state but one less root,
which implies we have one additional hole in the distribution of the Jα1 . Let us denote the
corresponding integer by J h and restrict our attention to the case J h ≤ MGS2 −1 . Then energy
and momentum are given by
E sc (k h , h ) = −ε1 (h ) − κ(k h ) ,
Psc (k h , h ) = − p1 (h ) − p(k h ) + π.

(7.179)

By construction this excitation reduces to the spin-charge scattering state considered previously when the magnetic ﬁeld goes to zero. The case where we have a particle-like
excitation in the distribution of Jα1 instead of a hole can be treated in complete analogy with
the two-spinon excitation considered above.

7.7 Zero magnetic ﬁeld and less than half-ﬁlled band
Let us now consider a less than half-ﬁlled band 0 < n c < 1 and zero magnetic ﬁeld. Here the
ground state is metallic and in contrast to the half-ﬁlled case there is no single-particle gap,
i.e. there exist gapless excitations with the quantum numbers of an electron. For deﬁniteness
let us take the total number of electrons NGS = 2 × odd. The occupation numbers of the
ground state are M1 = M2 e = N2GS , which implies that I j are half-odd integers and Jα1 are
integers. In the ground state all vacancies are ﬁlled symmetrically around zero

(7.180)

The distributions of the corresponding spectral parameters in the thermodynamic limit are
described by (6.B.5). In order to determine the excitation spectrum we will again make use
of the dressed energies and momenta obtained from the solution of the TBA equations.
There are three different kinds of elementary excitations.
r The ﬁrst type of elementary excitation is gapless, carries no spin and has charge ∓e.

It corresponds to adding a particle to or making a hole in the distribution of k’s. Such
excitations are sometimes called antiholons and holons respectively7 and have dressed
energy ±κ(k) and dressed momentum ± p(k).
7

We will follow this nomenclature, although it is somewhat imprecise, as we have already used the same terminology for the
elementary excitations in the charge sector at half ﬁlling, which are different in nature.

r The second type of elementary excitation is gapless and carries spin- 1 but no charge.
2

It corresponds to a hole in the distribution of 1 ’s. Such excitations are called spinons.
They have dressed energy −ε1 () and dressed momentum − p1 ().
r There is an inﬁnite number of different types of gapped excitations that carry charge but
no spin. They correspond to adding a k- string of length n to the ground state. Their
dressed energies are εn (), their dressed momenta are pn ().

In ﬁgures 7.27 and 7.28 we plot the dressed energies κ( p(k)) and ε1 ( p1 ()) as functions of
the dressed momenta for several values of n c and u.
The resulting dispersions can be interpreted in terms of a band picture for spinons and
antiholons. The antiholon band covers the entire Brillouin zone whereas the spinon band
only covers the interval [− πn2 c , πn2 c ], where n c is the density. In the ground state the spinon
band is ﬁlled completely whereas the antiholon band is ﬁlled in the interval [−π n c , π n c ].

(7.181)

The ground state has zero momentum and corresponds to symmetric distributions of I j and
Jα1 (7.180). Making use of the monotonicity properties of p(k) and p1 () we conclude that
the ground state indeed corresponds to ﬁlling all spinon states with p1 () ∈ [− πn2 c , πn2 c ] and
antiholon states with p(k) ∈ [−πn c , π n c ]. It is apparent from ﬁgure 7.28 that the bandwidth
of the antiholon band does not depend on u. It is easy to see using the integral equation
for κ(k) that the bandwidth is actually equal to κ(π ) − κ(0) = 4 (or 4t if we restore the
hopping matrix element t). On the other hand the bandwidth of the spinon band depends
sensitively on u. This should be the case as in the large-U limit the effective Heisenberg
exchange is 4t 2 /U .
Let us emphasize that so far we have talked about elementary excitations in the repulsive
Hubbard model below half ﬁlling. Like in the half-ﬁlled case it is important to distinguish
these from ‘physical’ excitations, which are the permitted combinations of elementary
excitations. As in the half-ﬁlled case there are no excitations involving only one spinon or
one (anti)holon. The simplest gapless excitations involve a pair of elementary excitations
and we will consider them next. Unlike in the half-ﬁlled case there exist single-particle
excitations below half ﬁlling. These involve k- strings and all have gaps. We will consider
examples of such excitations below.
7.7.1 Charge-neutral excitations
Example 1 Particle-hole excitation.
This is a two-parametric gapless physical excitation with spin and charge zero, i.e. its
quantum numbers as well as its occupation numbers are the same as the ones of the ground
state. It is obtained by removing a spectral parameter kh with |kh | < Q from the groundstate distribution of k’s and adding a spectral parameter k p with |k p | > Q. Its energy and
momentum are
E ph = κ(k p ) − κ(kh ) ,
Pph = p(k p ) − p(kh ) .

(7.182)

This excitation is allowed by the selection rules (4.44) as in the ground state only the
half-odd integers |I j | ≤ (NGS − 1)/2 are occupied and thus the possibility of removing
a root corresponding to |Ih | ≤ (NGS − 1)/2 and adding a root corresponding to |I p | >
(NGS − 1)/2 exists. The particle-hole excitation was ﬁrst studied by means of the root
density approach by C.F. Coll in [88]. In ﬁgure 7.29 we show the particle-hole spectrum for
densities n c = 0.6 and n c = 0.8. As we approach half ﬁlling the phase-space for particles
shrinks to zero and it is clear from ﬁgure 7.29 that as the density increases the total area of
the particle-hole continuum diminishes.

The low-energy modes occur at momenta 0 and ±2π n c mod 2π . This can be easily
understood in terms of the ‘band’ picture discussed above.
Example 2a Spin triplet excitation.
Let us consider an excitation involving the spin degrees of freedom next. If we change
the number of down spins by one while keeping the number of electrons ﬁxed we obtain an
excitation with spin 1. Recalling that in the ground state we have NGS electrons out of which
M1 = NGS /2 have spin down, the excited state will have occupation numbers Me = NGS
and M1 = NGS /2 − 1. The selection rules (4.44) then read

(7.183)

The ﬁrst condition is irrelevant as we are below half ﬁlling, but the second one tells us that
there are two more vacancies than there are roots. In other words, ﬂipping one spin leads
to two holes in the distribution of 1 ’s. There is one more subtlety we have to take care of:
changing the number of down spins by one, while keeping the number of electrons ﬁxed
leads to a shift of all I j in (4.36) by either 12 or − 12 . In other words the I j ’s are now integers
whereas they were half-odd integers for the ground state. The consequence of this shift is a
constant contribution of ±π NLGS to the momentum of the excited state as can be seen from
(5.97). This leads to two ‘branches’ of the same excitation. The possible distributions for
the I j ’s in the spin triplet excitation are shown in ﬁgure 7.30.
Taking this into account we obtain a gapless two-spinon scattering state with energy and
momentum
E trip = −ε1 (1h ) − ε1 (2h ) ,
Ptrip = − p1 (1h ) − p1 (2h ) ± π n c .

form of the continuum stays the same as the density changes. In ﬁgure 7.32 we fold back to
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. The zero energy modes in the spin-triplet spectrum occur at wave
numbers 0, ±πn c and ±2πn c mod (2π ).
In the Hubbard model the spin-triplet excitations were ﬁrst studied by A. A. Ovchinnikov [352] and by C. F. Coll [88]. The situation encountered here is similar to the spin- 12
Heisenberg chain [132] in the sense that the spin-triplet excitation is a scattering continuum
of two spin- 12 objects. Furthermore there is a spin-singlet excitation, which is precisely
degenerate with the triplet (see Example 2b below). This ﬁts nicely into a picture based on
spin- 12 objects: scattering states of two spinons give precisely one spin 1 and one spin 0
multiplet 12 ⊗ 12 = 1 ⊕ 0. Finally, when we approach half ﬁlling, the spin-triplet continuum
goes over into the S = 1 two-spinon scattering continuum of the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model
discussed previously in subsection 7.2.4.
On the other hand there are differences as well: in the less than half-ﬁlled Hubbard model
the Fermi momentum is generally incommensurate, which leads to incommensurabilities
in the spin excitations (see ﬁgure 7.31) as is apparent from ﬁgures 7.31–7.32.

Example 2b Spin singlet excitation.
Let us now choose the occupation numbers as Me = NGS , M1 = N2GS − 2, M2 = 1. The
corresponding state has the same quantum numbers as the ground state. From (4.44) we ﬁnd
that there are NGS /2 vacancies for real ’s and thus two holes corresponding to rapidities
1h and 2h . In other words the excitation considered involves two spinons. As far as the
2-string is concerned we ﬁnd that the associated integer must be zero J12 = 0. The same
shift as in Example 2a occurs for the I j ’s. Using (5.103) and (5.97) we obtain the energy
and momentum of the associated excitation
E sing = −ε1 (1h ) − ε1 (2h ) ,
Psing = − p1 (1h ) − p1 (2h ) ± π n c .

(7.185)

We see that the spin singlet is precisely degenerate with the spin triplet considered above.
This indicates a symmetry beyond simple spin rotational invariance: it is a consequence of
the sl(2) Yangian symmetry of the Hamiltonian in zero magnetic ﬁeld in the inﬁnite volume
(see Chapter 14).

7.7.2 Charged excitations
Example 3 ‘Antiholon-Spinon’ excitation.
Let us now consider an excitation with the quantum numbers of an electron, i.e. spin
1
± 2 and charge −e with respect to the ground state. We choose Me = NGS + 1, M1 = N2GS .
It follows from (4.40), (4.41) and (4.45) that I j are half-odd integers and Jα1 are half-odd
integers with range

parameter of this hole, which corresponds to a spinon, by h . Energy and momentum of

S z = − 12 excitation is obtained by acting with the spin lowering operator S − and is degenerate with the S z = 12 state. By construction the support of this excitation disappears as
we approach half ﬁlling as the range in momentum space for the k-particle vanishes. The
antiholon-spinon excitation was analyzed by H. J. Schulz in [384] by means of a numerical
solution of the Bethe ansatz equations on a lattice with 40 sites.

Example 4 ‘Holon-Spinon’ excitation.
Similarly we can construct an excitation where one electron is removed from the ground
state. We choose Me = NGS − 1, M1 = N2GS − 1. It follows from (4.40), (4.41) and (4.45)
that I j are integers and Jα1 are integers with range

Compared to the ground state there is one less spectral parameter k and therefore the

Equation (7.188) implies that there are N2GS vacancies and thus one hole in the distribution
of the spectral parameters 1α . Let us denote the spectral parameter of this hole, which

that the ‘hole’ in the continuum around zero momentum is a result of folding back to the

of section 7.2. The holon-spinon excitation was analyzed by H. J. Schulz in [384] by means
of a numerical solution of the Bethe ansatz equations on a lattice with 40 sites.

Example 5 k- string of length 2.
Last but not least let us consider the simplest excitation involving a k--string. One possibility is to choose the occupation numbers as Me = NGS − 2, M1 = NGS /2 − 1, M1 = 1.
This excitation has the same quantum numbers as the ground state. There are N2GS − 1
vacancies for an identical number of half-odd integers Jα1 and hence no holes in the distribution of 1α . We also keep the distribution of I j ﬁxed in such a way that I j+1 − I j = 1. It
is easily checked that this excitation is allowed by (4.44) and that its energy and momentum
are
E k− = ε1 () ,

Pk− = p1 () ,

(7.190)

where  ∈ (−∞, ∞). In ﬁgure 7.35 the dispersion of a k- string of length 2 is shown for
u = 0.125 and u = 0.5 and several values of density n c . We see that the range of momenta
collapses to zero as we approach half ﬁlling. At the same time the dressed energy approaches
zero. This is in agreement with the results for a half-ﬁlled band [121], where both the dressed
energy and the range of momentum are identically zero.

where the contribution −2µ − 4u has been subtracted.

In order to further exhibit this collapse we subtract the offset −2µ − 4u. The resulting
curves are displayed in ﬁgure 7.36.
The 2-string excitation has the same spin and η z quantum numbers as for example particlehole excitations (Example 1). However, the 2-string dispersion does not overlap with the
particle-hole continuum shown in ﬁgure 7.29 as it occurs at higher energies. Hence a decay
of the 2-string into a particle-hole pair is not possible for kinematic reasons.

7.8 Finite magnetic ﬁeld and less than half-ﬁlled band
The excitation spectrum below half ﬁlling in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld can be determined in an analogous way. Now both k- strings and -strings of arbitrary length become
dynamical objects. Excitations involving such strings are however gapped for the reasons
stated in Sections 7.6 and 7.7.
Some excited states have been considered by J. M. P. Carmelo et al. in [77].

Excited states at zero temperature

7.9 Empty band in the inﬁnite volume
The ground state of the empty band is given by the reference state of the Bethe ansatz.
Therefore, excitations in a large, ﬁnite volume are obtained by solving the Bethe ansatz
equations for one, two, three, etc. particles. The result is a very complicated set of manyelectron states. Let us look at some examples. We stress that a part of the following discussion
is based on the string hypothesis and therefore should be taken cum grano salis as explained
in Chapter 4. In the following discussion we will drop the constant contribution of u L to
the energy, i.e. discuss a Hamiltonian of the form

This state is obtained by setting N = Me = 1 in Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) or
equivalently N = 1, M = 0 in the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96). By construction the

one recovers a simple cosine-band. As discussed in Appendices 3.D and 3.F the oneelectron state (let us denote it by |k ) is a highest-weight state of the spin SU(2) and a
lowest weight state of the η-pairing SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard model. As a result
descendant states are obtained by acting with symmetry operators. For example a downspin electron excitation is obtained by acting with the spin-lowering operator, i.e. S − |k .
It has the same energy and momentum as |k . We must remember that µ = 0 so that the
Hamiltonian does not commute with η, but instead
[η+ , H ] = 2µ η+ .

This implies that states of the form η

Example 2 Two-electron spin triplet state.
Taking Me = 2 in Takahashi’s equations and all other occupation numbers zero (or
equivalently N = 2, M = 0 in the Lieb-Wu equations), we obtain a two-electron state with

possible to construct further states by acting with the S O(4) ladder operators.

The occupation numbers Me = 2, M1 = 1 in Takahashi’s equations give a state with
z
S = 0. From the highest-weight theorem it follows that S2 = 0 so that we are dealing with
a spin singlet. The expression for energy and momentum are the same as for the spin triplet
(7.195), whereas the Bethe ansatz equations now read

and inserting this back into (7.198) we obtain two coupled polynomial equations in exp(ik j )

exp(ik1 L) = exp(−ik2 L) =

sin(k1 ) − sin(k2 ) − 2iu

For ﬁxed L these equations can only be solved numerically. However, simpliﬁcations occur
in the inﬁnite-volume limit. This is most easily seen by taking the logarithm of (7.201)

A similar equation holds for k2 . In the inﬁnite-volume limit L → ∞, Lj = ﬁxed the ﬁrst
term in (7.202) drops out and we obtain the same result (7.197) for the energy as for the
two-electron spin triplet state. Thus in the inﬁnite-volume limit the singlet and triplet states
are degenerate. This degeneracy, which is related to the Yangian symmetry (see Chapter
15), is broken in the ﬁnite volume.

Finally let us consider the case M1 = 1 and all other occupation numbers zero. The
resulting excitation is a spin singlet two-electron state. Energy and momentum are

(7.204)

In the inﬁnite-volume limit we obtain the dispersion shown in ﬁgure 7.37 where we have
ﬁxed the chemical potential to lie at the boundary of the empty-band phase µ = −2 − 2u.
We see that the k- string dispersion is always above the two-electron scattering continuum.
For small u it sits just on top of the continuum whereas for large u it occurs at a very high
energy. This is somewhat counter-intuitive as the k- string describes a bound state of two
electrons in the sense that its wave function decays exponentially with respect to the relative
distance between the two electrons. As explained in Section 3.2.4 the fact that bound states
lie above the scattering continua in energy is a lattice effect.

Appendices to Chapter 7

7.A Relating root-density and dressed-energy formalisms
In this appendix we discuss a method that relates the Yang-Yang approach of Sections 7.2
and 7.7 directly to the root-density approach we used in Section 7.3. This is particularly
useful for the less than half-ﬁlled band, where the excitation energies are given implicitly
in terms of the solutions of coupled integral equations that have to be solved numerically.
As the integral equations for the root densities and the dressed energies are quite different,
it is not immediately obvious that the expressions for the excitation energies obtained
in the two approaches are equivalent. The method discussed below permits one to prove
this equivalence. For deﬁniteness we will concentrate on the particular example of the
charge-singlet exitation at half ﬁlling in zero magnetic ﬁeld, the method we use is however
completely general. The integral equations for the root densities are (7.85), (7.86)

Finite size corrections at zero temperature

In this chapter we want to reﬁne the analysis of the ground state and low-lying excitations
of the Hubbard model in the phases with gapless modes, i.e. phases II, IV and V discussed
in Chapters 6, 7, by taking account of corrections which are important when considering
Hubbard chains of ﬁnite length L. For the generic case, i.e. away from half-ﬁlling in
a magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬁnite-size corrections to the spectrum of the Hubbard model have
been calculated by F. Woynarovich [487]. These results are the basis for our discussion
in the following Chapter 9 of the asymptotic behaviour of correlation functions within the
conformal approach [6,51,62,75] and thereby will allow us to make contact with Haldane’s
Luttinger liquid approach for the description of one-dimensional strongly correlated electron
systems [189–192]
8.1 Generic case – the repulsive Hubbard model in a magnetic ﬁeld
To investigate how the thermodynamic limit is approached we have to take into account
ﬁnite-size corrections in our previous derivation of integral equations from Takahashi’s
equations. This analysis has to be performed separately for each of the phases with gapless
excitations identiﬁed before. From a technical point of view the most complex situation is
found in phase IV – the partially ﬁlled, partially magnetized band with two massless modes.
The ﬁnite-size scaling behaviour in the phases with a single gapless mode can be studied
using the same techniques and we will point out the differences to the ‘generic’ case studied
in this section later in this chapter.
Since we are interested in the ground state and low-lying excitations we restrict ourselves
to solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations which have been identiﬁed as the most important
ones for the low-energy sector of the repulsive Hubbard model at less than half-ﬁlling in a
magnetic ﬁeld (phase IV) before, namely those described in terms of ﬁnite densities of real
roots k and λ only.1
8.1.1 Finite-size corrections to Takahashi’s equations
From Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) we have obtained the deﬁning equations (5.29),
(5.30) for the counting functions y(k) and z 1 (λ). These functions are well-deﬁned objects

This implies that we are considering states with N = Me electrons and M = M1 overturned spins in the following.

for any system size. Extending the deﬁnition (5.36), (5.37) of root densities to ﬁnite systems
we can deﬁne ﬁnite size densities of the Bethe Ansatz roots (the notation u (L) for ﬁnite size
quantities is used to avoid confusion with the corresponding quantities in the thermodynamic
limit)

On the level of the Bethe Ansatz integral equations ﬁnite-size corrections for the densities
(i.e. corrections to equations (5.93) of sub-leading order in 1/L) are taken into account using
the method introduced by de Vega and Woynarovich [470] (see also Refs. [63, 64, 145, 216,
488]). It has been applied to the repulsive Hubbard model at half-ﬁlling by Woynarovich and
Eckle [489] and away from half-ﬁlling by Woynarovich [487]. The ﬁnite-size corrections
to the spectrum of the attractive Hubbard model have been studied in Ref. [65].
This method is based on application of the Euler-McLaurin summation formula to the
discrete equations above ( f  denotes the derivative of f )

where we have introduced n − = n 1 − 12 , n + = n 2 + 12 .
To use this formula we restrict ourselves to a subset of Bethe Ansatz states which contains
the zero temperature ground state and an important class of low-lying excitations: consider
solutions to Takahashi’s equations (4.36)–(4.38) for a set of consecutive quantum numbers

I j = I− + j − ,
2
1
Jα1 = J−1 + α − ,

j = 1, . . . , N ,
α = 1, . . . , M.

y (L) (Q ± ) = 2π I± /L,

z 1(L) (A± ) = 2π J±1 /L .

(8.6)

Now the Euler-McLaurin formula (8.2) is directly applicable to equations (8.4), (8.5)
resulting in a system of two coupled linear

8.1.2 Finite-size corrections to the energy
To compute the ﬁnite-size corrections to the energies we have to perform similar manipulations with an appropriate expression for the energy of the Bethe Ansatz state corresponding
to our choice (8.3) of quantum numbers. The expression used in Chapter 6 to study the
ground state properties in the L → ∞ limit relied on the thermodynamic approach and
was based on the dressed energies e(x) = (κ(k), ε1 (λ)). These were given in terms of the
integral equations (6.10) similar to (8.8), namely
e(k, λ) = e(0) (k, λ) + K$ (k, λ; k  , λ |X ) ⊗ e(k  , λ ) .

(8.15)

The driving terms are the bare energies e(0)
e(0) = (ec(0) (k), es(0) (λ)) = (−2 cos k − µ − 2u − B, 2B) .

are simply L times the energy density for a state with given values of Q ± and A± in the

ground state and low-lying excitations we should expand (8.19) around the Bethe Ansatz
state which minimizes these terms for given values of the chemical potential µ and magnetic
ﬁeld B. This is just the zero temperature ground state of the Hubbard model as determined
in Chapter 6. This state is characterized by the vanishing of the dressed energies at the
Fermi points k = ±Q, λ = ±A (6.11). Using the formal solutions of the integral equations
for the dressed energy and the functions f ik(±) we ﬁnd

The last term is the leading ﬁnite-size correction to the ground state energy of the onedimensional repulsive Hubbard model in the generic case. As will be discussed later this
result can be used to justify the ﬁeld theoretical description of this model in terms of two
free bosons for any non negative value of the coupling constant u.
To proceed we have to expand e∞ (X ) up to second order in the variation of the Fermi
points X . The linear terms in X = (X ∓ X 0 ) vanish as a consequence of ei (±X 0,i ) = 0.
Variation to second order in X gives (note that eG S = e∞ (X 0 ) is the ground state energy

8.1.3 The dressed charge matrix
To complete our analysis of the ﬁnite-size spectrum of the repulsive Hubbard chain in a
magnetic ﬁeld we have to express the variations X in terms of the deviation of the particle
number N and magnetization M and the asymmetry of the distribution of quantum numbers
2Di = n i+ + n i− from their ground state values. This is possible with the counting functions
and their relation to the densities ri(L) (8.1):

Since the variations X enter equation (8.25) quadratically and we have to compute the

in these expressions by their leading terms ri(∞) . We now consider the total densities deﬁned

In the thermodynamic limit the ground state is the unique state with Nc = Ns = Dc =

number of electrons and down spins with respect to this ground state. Due to the constraints

8.2 Special cases
The expressions derived in the previous section show that the complete spectrum of lowlying states in the Hubbard model can be parametrized in terms of just four numbers, namely
the elements of the dressed charge matrix (8.29) (apart from the Fermi velocities vc and
vs which are known from the discussion of the thermodynamic limit already). Given the
parameters of the system, i.e. the interaction strength u and the chemical potential and
magnetic ﬁeld the entries of Z are easily computed numerically.
In the present section we want to discuss a few cases where the expressions derived above
simplify signiﬁcantly and even allow for an analytical calculation of some of the elements
of Z .
8.2.1 Zero magnetic ﬁeld
For vanishing magnetic ﬁeld the ground state of the one-dimensional Hubbard model has
zero magnetization and is a spin-SU (2) singlet. As noted in the discussion of ground state
properties (see Section 6.B) this leads to the fact that the distribution of spin rapidities λ

8.2 Special cases

277

covers the real axis (A = ∞) which in turn allows to simplify the Bethe Ansatz integral
equations for the root densities and dressed energies by Fourier transformation. Similarly,
the coupled equations (8.31) for the dressed charge matrix reduce to a simple scalar one in
this case [487].
Integrating out ξcs from the ﬁrst two of the integral equations (8.31) we are left with a
scalar equation for ξcc ≡ ξ (the kernel R(x) is deﬁned in (5.104)):
 Q
ξ (k) = 1 +
dk  cos k  R(sin k − sin k  ) ξ (k  ).
(8.40)
−Q

The resulting driving term in the integral equation for ξcs vanishes as 1/A2 , this leads to
Z cs = 0 for the corresponding entry in the dressed charge matrix. Proceeding analogously
for the second pair of integral equations for the dressed charge matrix, one obtains ξsc (k) =
ξ (k)/2. The remaining element of ξ is determined by the integral equation

For any ﬁxed coupling strength sin Q becomes small for small particle density (Q → 0)
and near half-ﬁlling (Q → π).

This value of ξ (z 0 ) also governs the low-energy spectrum for small u close to half-ﬁlling

In summary we have shown that the dressed charge matrix for the one-dimensional
Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling in zero magnetic ﬁeld is of the form (8.42) for any value
of the repulsive interaction u ≥ 0. The remaining parameter ξ (Q) varies in the interval

1 ≤ ξ (z 0 ) ≤ 2.

A numerical solution of the Bethe Ansatz integral equations for different values of sin Q/u
gives the lines of constant ξ (Q) in the n c -u-plane (see ﬁgure 8.1). We note that the ﬁnite
size spectrum depends on the Fermi velocities vc and vs in addition to ξ (Q).

8.2.2 Partially ﬁlled spin-polarized band
In phase II all electrons have spin up and excitations with magnetization less than n c /2
have a gap. This implies that the low-lying states are some of the plane-wave eigenstates
of the tight-binding Hamiltonian (2.12). The dispersion of the gapless charge excitations as
found in Section 6.3 is just the bare energy ec(0) (k) from (8.16) and the complete excitation
spectrum is that of free lattice electrons with Fermi momentum k F↑ = π n c and Fermi
velocity v↑ = 2 sin k F↑ .

for u → ∞(0). The dotted line denotes the value of n c (Q = π/2) where the dressed charge takes
its maximum value for given u. Note that the line n c = 1 is excluded here. There the Hubbard
model falls into a different universality class – that of the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet (see
Section 8.2.3).

Just as in our discussion of the excitations of the fully interacting model above a classiﬁcation in terms of three different processes is possible:
r states with a charge that differs from the one in the ground state by N ,

r states carrying a current 2D k due to the transfer of D electrons from one Fermi point
↑ F↑

↑

to the other (backscattering),
r N ± particle-hole pairs near one of the Fermi points at ±k ,
F↑
and arbitrary combinations of the above.
Due to the fact that the electrons are effectively free in this phase there is no renormalization of the dispersion due to a reordering of the Fermi sea in presence of these excitations
and the ﬁnite size spectrum is easily obtained after linearizing the dispersion in the vicinity
of the Fermi points:


ε(k) ≈ ±v↑ k ∓ k F↑

Finite size corrections at zero temperature

8.2.3 The half-ﬁlled band
In Chapter 7, we have shown that in phase V, i.e. at half ﬁlling n c = 1, only charge neutral
excitations are gapless and consequently accessible by the techniques used in the derivation
of the ﬁnite size spectra. The contributions of the spin degrees of freedom to the ﬁnite-size
scaling behaviour have been found to be equivalent to those of the one-dimensional isotropic
Heisenberg model [488].
The ﬁnite size scaling behaviour of the ground state energy is obtained similarly as in
Section 8.1.2 (note that only the partially ﬁlled Fermi sea of spin rapidities has to be taken
into account) with the result
E = E0 −

π
vs .

vs is the Fermi velocity of the magnetic excitations. The ﬁnite size scaling corrections to

Again the ﬁnite size corrections are determined by a dressed charge through Z = ξs (A).
The function ξs is the solution to the following integral equation:
 A
dµ a2 (λ − µ)ξs (µ).
(8.55)
ξs (λ) = 1 −
−A

(This is in fact just the equation for ξss in (8.31) for Q = π ). Note that the ﬁnite spectrum
(8.52) in the spin polarized phase is of the form (8.54) with Z ≡ 1. This corresponds to
the use of the ‘bare’ charge ξ ≡ 1 rather than dressed charge and reﬂects the absence of
interaction induced renormalization of the dispersion in phase II.
For given value of u the boundaries of the integrals in (8.55)
√ depend on the magnetic ﬁeld.
The Fermi-sea of spin-waves disappears for B ≥ B0 = 2( u 2 + 1 − u). This corresponds
to the transition into phase III with half ﬁlled band and completely polarized spins as
discussed in Section (6.3). As the magnetic ﬁeld approaches B0 from below we have
3
A = (u 2 + 1)3/4 B0 − B.
(8.56)
The magnetic excitations are gapless for B ≤ B0 , with a ﬁnite-size spectrum given as a
function of the dressed charge (8.55) at λ = A
ξs (A) = 1 −

(8.57)

for magnetic ﬁelds close to B0 . ξs (A) decreases as the magnetic ﬁeld becomes smaller.
The case of vanishing magnetic ﬁeld, B = 0, has ﬁrst been studied by Woynarovich and
Eckle [489]. It corresponds to A → ∞, and the limiting value of ξs (A) can be√computed
using the Wiener Hopf method (see Appendix 8.A) giving lim A→∞ ξs (A) = 1/ 2.

8.2.4 Strong coupling limit
To illustrate the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the ﬁnite size spectra for a partially ﬁlled band
in more detail we now consider the limit u → ∞ where the Bethe Ansatz integral equations
simplify signiﬁcantly. The strong inﬂuence of a ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld on the spectrum was
ﬁrst observed by Frahm and Korepin [141].
After elimination of ρ from the integral equation (6.13) for the density of spin rapidities
we obtain

8.3 Finite-size spectrum of the open Hubbard chain
An important extension of the cases considered so far is that of the Hubbard chain with
open rather than periodic boundary conditions. We shall focus in this section on the case of
the repulsive Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling with additional local potentials coupling to
the number of electrons on the boundary sites, i.e.

− p(n 1↑ + n 1↓ ) − p (n L↑ + n L↓ )
It was shown ﬁrst by H. Schulz [380] that the Hubbard model continues to be solvable
by means of the Bethe Ansatz in the case of reﬂecting boundary conditions ( p = 0 = p  ).
Subsequently the solution was extended to non-vanishing boundary potentials [24,49,507].
By means of the Shiba transformation (2.59) it is clear that the open-boundary Hubbard
model with a magnetic ﬁeld instead of the potential on the boundary site
−2bS1z − 2b SLz

(8.71)

is also solvable [402, 403, 507]. Note that the boundary ﬁelds at the two ends of the chain
can be chosen independently, hence it is possible to combine a potential p on site 1 with
a boundary magnetic ﬁeld b on site L or vice versa. In general, the scattering due to the
reﬂection at an end of the chain and that between the particles in the bulk has to satisfy socalled reﬂection equations to be compatible with integrability of the system [406]. For the
open Hubbard chain and the boundary conditions discussed above this has been established

284

Finite size corrections at zero temperature

in Ref. [507] (see also [457]). Within this approach one can rule out a solvable combination
of potential and boundary magnetic ﬁeld at the same end of the chain or – as far as is known
to date – more complicated boundary conditions: while an integrable Hamiltonian for a
Kondo spin coupled to the boundary site of the supersymmetric t–J model is known [144]
a similar construction for the Hubbard model still requires a deeper understanding of its
algebraic structure.

8.3.1 Bethe Ansatz equations for the open Hubbard chain

literature, here we just state the equivalent of the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96) for the

Compared to the Lieb-Wu equations for the periodic chain one observes two differences:
ﬁrst, the geometric phase factor for the electrons is exp(i2k L) rather than exp(ik L) and the
number of two-particle scattering phases on the r.h.s. of the equations is doubled: for a full
path “around” the chain a particle has to be moved from its original position to site L, then
to site 1 and back. Second, there are additional phases in the ﬁrst set of these equations.
This is the only effect of the boundary potentials p and p  .
The energy of the eigenstate of (8.70) corresponding to a solution of (8.72) is

There is no explicit dependence on the boundary conditions. It is present however through
the dependence of the quasi momenta k j on p, p  determined from equations (8.72).
In the thermodynamic limit L → ∞ with both the particle density and magnetization
kept ﬁxed we expect that the energy density of the ground state is eG S independent of the
boundary conditions. The effect of the boundary potential will manifest itself in an order L 0
contribution to the energy. In addition, we expect a different ﬁnite-size scaling behaviour
of the ground state energy (8.24) and the low-lying excited states (8.36).
From a physical point of view it is clear that the ground state of the model (8.70) should
have up to two electrons bound to the ﬁrst site for sufﬁciently large p (and similar to
site L for sufﬁciently large p  ). Numerical solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations (8.72)

8.3 Finite-size spectrum of the open Hubbard chain

285

shows that this is indeed the fact: the presence of the bound states is indicated by complex
quasimomenta k and rapidities λ in the conﬁguration corresponding to the ground state for
p > 1 [49, 458].2 These complex roots are not present in the ground state conﬁguration for
p < 1 [24] and are very different from the k − -strings (4.13) discussed in Chapter 4.1.
While p-dependent complex combinations of two k and one λ exist for any p, they are found
to coincide with an η-pair in the (S O(4)-invariant) limit p → 0. Hence, they correspond to
highly excited states of the system and need not to be considered in the present context.
By careful analysis of the Bethe Ansatz equations one identiﬁes four regions for p which
have to be studied separately for the ground state [24, 49]:
p < 1: The classiﬁcation of solutions to the BAE is identical to that for the Hubbard
chain with periodic boundary conditions. No additional types of complex rapidities
exist.
√
1 < p < p1 = u + 1 + u 2 : In the ground state conﬁguration one of the quasimomenta,
say k N , takes the value k N = i ln( p) or, equivalently, sin k N = i t where



t=
p−
.
(8.74)
2
p
This value is realized with exponential accuracy even for systems of ﬁnite length L.
Since the quasimomenta k j parametrize the charge part of the states this solution may
be interpreted as a single
√ charge bound by the potential on site 1.
p1 < p < p2 = 2u + 1 + 4u 2 : Upon further increasing the boundary potential one
ﬁnds that the solution corresponding to the ground state contains a complex spin
rapidity λ M = sin k N − iu = i(t − u) in addition to k N . Just as the solution in region
1 < p < p1 this state may be interpreted as a charge bound to the edge of the chain.
The physical excitations in the spin-sector (i.e. holes in the distribution of λ ) are still
real.
p2 < p: For boundary potentials larger than the Hubbard interaction p  4u a pair of
electrons forming a singlet is bound to the surface, parametrized by λ M = sin k N −
iu = sin k N −1 + iu = i(t − u).
Similarly, complex roots to the Bethe Ansatz equations appear as p  is varied. It can be
shown however, that no additional complex solutions are possible as p or p  are increased
beyond p2 – in perfect agreement with the physical intuition.
Having characterized the conﬁguration of Bethe Ansatz roots corresponding to the ground
state of the open Hubbard chain we can proceed as in Section 8.1 to compute the ﬁnite size
corrections to the energies of the ground state and the continua of low lying excitations.
Note that one may also consider eigenstates of the model where the boundary bound
states discussed above are unoccupied, i.e. the corresponding complex quasi momenta or
rapidities are allowed but not present in the solution considered. Above these highly excited
states there arise different continua of states that can be treated in an analogous way. These
2

This is similar to the situation observed in the XXZ Heisenberg chain with a boundary magnetic ﬁeld [234,412] and a continuum
model related to the Kondo problem [180, 477].

286

Finite size corrections at zero temperature

continua have to be considered for the description of Fermi edge singularities in the presence
of boundary bound states [117].

8.3.2 Surface energy of the open Hubbard chain
In the following we restrict ourselves to the discussion of a boundary potential at site 1 of
the chain only, i.e. p  = 0. It is straightforward to extend the discussion to the general case,
however. For the analysis of the equations (8.72) it is convenient to double the number of
variables by identifying of k− j = −k j and λ− = −λ and setting k0 = 0 = λ0 . After this
“symmetrization”, the Bethe Ansatz equations read

In this form they depend on differences of the variables only, which permits the application
of the same methods used in the periodic boundary case for their analysis. Formally, this
doubling of variables leads to non-physical solutions to the equations which have to be
removed by hand (i.e. by considering only even solutions for quantities such as the root
densities).
To derive linear integral equations as in Section 8.1.1 above we introduce counting functions and root densities for the real roots of (8.75) after taking into account the complex
roots corresponding to the boundary bound states explicitly. This procedure implies a modiﬁcation in the deﬁnition of the boundaries of integration in (8.26) to account for the complex
roots, namely:

dλ rs(L) (λ) = 2M + 1 − 2θ H ( p − p1 ) .

(θ H (x) denotes the Heaviside step function in this section). Proceeding as in Section 8.1.1
we obtain integral equations of the form (8.7) where the driving terms up to order L −1 are

The energy (3.97) of the Bethe states can be expressed in terms of the dressed energies
(8.15). Being bulk-related quantities derived from the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, these
are given by the same equations as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. To order
L 0 the ground state energy is given by:
E 0 = Lu + LeG S + f G S .

8.3.4 Finite-size corrections to the energy of the open Hubbard chain
The calculation of the L −1 corrections to the energies of the ground state and low-lying excitations can be performed following the method of Woynarovich [487] as presented above.
Asakawa and Suzuki [24] computed the spectrum of low-lying states of the open Hubbard
chain for p < 1, this result is easily generalized to arbitrary strength of the boundary potential [49]. The result is a reﬁnement of equation (8.81) for the ground state energy

the open boundary case they are given by π vi = ei (X 0,i )/ri(∞) (X 0,i ) here. The L −1 -term in
(8.87) is the leading ﬁnite-size correction to the ground state energy of the Hubbard model
with open boundary conditions. It does not depend on the strength of the boundary potential
p but has a different universal numerical prefactor than in the periodic case (8.24).
The numbers Ni+ in (8.88) are non-negative integers counting the number of particle
hole excitations at the Fermi points (due to the symmetrization of the Bethe Ansatz roots
there exists a single Fermi point for each degree of freedom). Z i j are the elements of the
dressed charge matrix given in terms of the integral equations (8.29), identical to the case
of periodic boundary conditions, and Nc = N − Ln c , Ns = M − Lm are the changes
in the numbers of electrons and down-spins as compared to the values obtained from the

where  Ñi = Ni − θi ( p) now denotes the change in charge and spin as compared to
the ground state, respectively (see also [149, 478]). There is no equivalent of the quantum
numbers Di in the ﬁnite-size spectrum of the periodic chain (8.36), the open boundaries do
not allow for a non-zero current.

8.4 Relation of the dressed charge matrix to observables
As shown above, the ﬁnite size corrections in the spectrum of the one-dimensional Hubbard
model are characterized in terms of the velocity of the gapless excitations and in addition
the elements of the dressed charge matrix or its scalar equivalent when there is a single
branch of gapless excitations only. An obvious question – in particular in view of the
possible application to non integrable models – is, whether this quantity is merely a construct
appearing within the Bethe Ansatz solution or can be related to other observable quantities.
To address this question we ﬁrst return to the discussion of the Hubbard model in a vanishing
magnetic ﬁeld.

8.4.1 Zero magnetic ﬁeld
Following Refs. [63, 145, 190, 487] one can prove the identity
1 ∂n c
= ξ (Q).
2ρ(Q) ∂ Q

(8.93)

8.4 Relation of the dressed charge matrix to observables

291

This relation clearly shows that the dressed charge reveals itself in a characteristic way in
the number 2ρ(Q)∂ Q of electrons added near the Fermi surface due to a change in the total
density n c .
A more physical interpretation of the dressed charge (which is directly applicable to
models in the universality class of the Hubbard model not integrable by Bethe Ansatz)
is found in its relation to certain thermodynamic coefﬁcients [63, 191] – in this case the
compressibility of the electron gas
χc =

1 ∂ Nc
.
L ∂µ

(8.94)

To see this, consider the ﬁnite-size corrections (8.36) to the energies again. Using the special
form of the dressed charge matrix for zero magnetic ﬁeld this expression becomes

Now let us change the ground state conﬁguration under consideration by adding electrons
while keeping zero magnetization, i.e. Nc = 2Ns and Dc = Ds = 0. This state is actually the ground state of the system with Nc + Nc electrons. From (8.95) we ﬁnd the
change in the ground state energy due to this change of the electron number to be
E =

π vc 1
(Nc )2 .
2L ξ (Q)2

(8.96)

To express this change in terms of the compressibility (8.94) we ﬁrst have to separate the energy in the contribution of a micro-canonical ensemble and the contribution of the chemical
potential E = Ẽ − µNc . Expansion of this quantity in powers of Nc and comparison to
(8.96) yields the thermodynamical relation µ = ∂ Ẽ/∂ Nc and the desired relation between
the dressed charge and the compressibility:
ξ (Q)2 = π vc χc .

(8.97)

An equivalent expression has been established for the 1D Bose gas with δ-repulsion [191].

8.4.2 Half-ﬁlling
In a completely analogous way we can express the dressed charge ξs (A) from equation (8.55)
in terms of a thermodynamical exponent, in this case the magnetic susceptibility
∂m
.
(8.98)

To do so consider the change in the ground state energy of the system due to a change in
the magnetization m = −Ns /L. Comparison of the result from the ﬁnite size scaling

ﬁnd
ξs (A)2 = π vs χ (B).

(8.100)

(Here we have used that ∂ Ẽ/∂m = L B). Again this relation is equivalent to the one found
in the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet [63].

8.4.3 Generic case
In the previous sections we have shown the importance of the dressed charge matrix Z
(8.29) for the description of the low-energy behaviour of the Hubbard model. In addition
we have obtained relations for the dressed charge that allow for a physical interpretation
in several limiting cases (8.93), (8.97), (8.100). In this section we want to generalize these
relations to the case with two degrees of freedom (i.e. spin and charge). First of all it is
straightforward to generalize (8.93) to a matrix situation [145, 216, 487]:
1
∂n i
= Zi j .
2ρ j (X j ) ∂ X j

(8.101)

As before, the dressed charge matrix Z governs the characteristic changes of the distribution
functions for charges and spin waves at the Fermi surface due to changes of the density and
magnetization.
Now let us try to ﬁnd a generalization of equations (8.97) and (8.100) where the dressed
charge was related to the compressibility and the magnetic susceptibility, respectively, to the
general case. Again we want to express the ﬁnite-size corrections (8.36) with Dc = Ds = 0
E =

in terms of thermodynamic coefﬁcients. To do so we proceed as in Section 8.4.1 and expand

in small changes of the number of charges Nc and the magnetization m. To second order
this gives

(8.107)

Note that (8.106) almost solves the problem, however, since the matrix Z enters in a symmetric combination of Z −1 and (Z −1 )T only we have found just three equations to ﬁx the
four elements of Z .
A fourth equation can be obtained by considering a change in the boundary conditions.
Enclosing a magnetic ﬂux in the ring on which the electrons can move leads to an additional
constant constant phase ϕ in the equations for the momenta k j of the charges

while leaving the equations for the rapidities of spin-waves unchanged. For small ϕ this
leads to a change in the ground state energy E ∝ ϕ 2 . The momentum of this state will be
P = n c ϕ.

(8.109)

This is the Aharonov-Bohm effect for this system. The current is given as j(ϕ) = ∂ E(ϕ)/∂ϕ.
On the other hand this change in boundary conditions corresponds to the ﬁnite-size
corrections (8.36) for an excited state with Nc = Ns = Ds = 0 and Dc = ϕ/2π . Hence
the change in energy can be given in terms of elements of the dressed charge matrix as

This is also related to an observable quantity [39, 395, 510].
To conclude, we have derived a set of equations (8.106), (8.110) that relates the elements
of the dressed charge matrix to observable quantities such as thermodynamic coefﬁcients
and velocities of spin waves and charge density waves. Hence, the complete spectrum of
gapless low-lying energies of the 1D Hubbard chain can be determined by taking certain combinations of these quantities. We believe that these relations continue to hold for
one-dimensional electron systems with more general interactions.

8.A Wiener Hopf calculation of the dressed charge
In the analysis of the zero temperature properties of the one-dimensional Hubbard model
we are frequently faced with the problem that certain quantities of physical interest are
given in terms of a function f (x) which is a solution of a linear Fredholm type integral
equation on some interval [−X, X ] on the real axis (see e.g. Appendix 5.B). The kernel
of these integral operators is usually well behaved. For ﬁnite X these equations have to be
solved numerically as outlined in Appendix 6.A. Only for X → ∞ an analytic solution for
f (x) is possible by Fourier transformation which is very useful to compute quantities which
depend on f (x) for |x|  X . The dressed charge, however, is an example for a quantity
for which we need to know the value of the function f on the boundary X of the interval.
Again for ﬁnite X , this can be efﬁciently computed numerically. For very large X (including
X → ∞) an analytical calculation of f (X ) is possible using a perturbative scheme based
on the Wiener Hopf method, introduced by Yang and Yang [495] to study the ground state
properties of the XXZ model (see Chapter 17.2).

8.A.1 Weak coupling limit of the dressed charge in zero magnetic ﬁeld
We now want to compute the value of ξ (z 0 ) from (8.43) in the limit of large z 0 which
determines the ﬁnite size spectrum of the Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling without external
magnetic ﬁeld in the weak coupling limit u → 0. This equation is of the type (17.21)
discussed in Chapter 17.2 with
K (z) = −R(z) ,

K̄ (ω) = − exp(−2|ω|)

of the charge density rather than z 0 = sin Q/u.

Asymptotics of correlation functions

Any experimentally measurable quantity can be expressed in terms of a suitable correlation
function. As we have seen in the previous chapters, the spectrum of the one-dimensional
Hubbard model can be studied in great detail, including the complete dependence on a
homogeneous chemical potential and the magnetic ﬁeld in a system of arbitrary size L –
either by the analysis of certain integral equations for the behaviour in the thermodynamic
limit and for the leading ﬁnite-size corrections or by solving the discrete Lieb-Wu equations
for given L numerically. From the spectrum certain one point functions such as the overall
electron density or magnetization can be computed within the framework of the Bethe
Ansatz.
Expectation values of more general operators, in particular two point correlation functions
O† (τ, x)O(0, 0)

(9.1)

are not accessible by means of the methods developed above, not even if we restrict ourselves
to the most interesting case of the asymptotic behaviour at large distances.
9.1 Low energy effective ﬁeld theory at weak coupling
9.1.1 Continuum limit
For a well established approach to the computation of correlation functions such as (9.1) we
may use the continuum limit of the Hubbard model introduced in Appendix 2.B in the limit
of weak coupling. The idea is to restrict oneself to the low-energy modes of the system,
which dominate the long distance asymptotics of the correlators.
For the free part of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, equation (2.12), the ground state is obtained
by ﬁlling all negative energy modes, i.e. all single particle states with momenta in the interval
[−k F , k F ] (we consider the case of a vanishing magnetic ﬁeld, so k F↑ = k F↓ = π n c /2).
Hence, all low-lying excitations can be constructed by taking into account the modes with
wave number close to the Fermi momenta ±k F .
As we have seen from our discussion of the exact solution above, the nature of the excitations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is completely different from what we know
from the free electron system, even for arbitrarily weak interaction. Still, following a standard perturbative approach we may assume – as long as the interaction is sufﬁciently weak

This term describes scattering processes involving a ﬁnite momentum transfer equal to
the reciprocal lattice vector 2π/a0 , e.g. scattering of two holes located in the vicinity of
−k F (at half-ﬁlling) off two particles located close to k F . An example of an Umklapp
scattering process is depicted in ﬁgure 9.1. Below half ﬁlling Umklapp processes involve
high-energy degrees of freedom as is apparent from Fig.9.1 and as a result play no role
in the low-energy effective theory. On the other hand, at half ﬁlling Umklapp processes
invole only modes in the vicinity of the Fermi points because 4k F a0 = 2π .

9.1.2 Bosonization and separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom
We now restrict ourselves to the discussion of the less than half-ﬁlled Hubbard model
and discuss the implications of the additional interaction (9.6) later (see Chapter 10).

The commutators between charge and spin currents vanish as do the commutators of

Asymptotics of correlation functions

reader to the textbooks [139, 168] and reviews [7, 385, 473] for introductions and detailed
treatments of this important subject. Our following discussion is quite brief; some further
details can be found in Chapter 10. Introducing two canonical bosonic ﬁelds c,s (z, z̄) =
ϕc,s (z) + ϕ̄c,s (z̄) (we use complex space time coordinates z = τ − i x, z̄ = τ + i x) together
with their holomorphic and antiholomorphic components ϕc,s and ϕ̄c,s we ﬁnd that relations
such as (9.9) can be obtained from the following expressions for the currents

where f ↑ = 1 = − f ↓ and ησ are Klein factors which fulﬁl {ηa , ηb } = 2δab and ensure
anticommutation relations between the Fermi ﬁelds. An immediate consequence of this
observation is that correlation functions computed for the free fermionic theory deﬁned by

Furthermore, in this representation the interaction part of the Hamiltonian (9.3) separates
into commuting parts depending only on charge and spin currents, respectively. Hence, in
its bosonized form the continuum Hamiltonian is a sum of two contributions H = Hc + Hs
describing charge and spin degrees of freedom, respectively.

where the velocity vs of the spin excitations is renormalized by the interaction as
vs ! v F − g/4π .

(9.20)

The terms proportional to vs form the SU (2)1 Wess-Zumino-Novikow-Witten (WZNW)
model. The remaining interaction term coupling right and left currents is a marginal perturbation (i.e. has scaling dimension d = 2). From the renormalization group (RG) equations
for the theory one ﬁnds that the relevance of the perturbation depends on the sign of the coupling constant g [12, 506] (see also in Chapter 10). For repulsive interactions, i.e. g > 0, it
is marginally irrelevant and can be neglected for the discussion of the low-lying excitations.
Hence, the Hamiltonian describing the spin sector is simply

,
vs
Hs =
(9.21)
dx (∂x s )2 + (∂x s )2 .
16π
On the other hand, the continuum limit of the attractive Hubbard model, i.e. g < 0 has to
be described by a completely different ﬁeld theory: in this case the marginal perturbation
due to the current-current interaction in the spin sector is marginally relevant – in complete
correspondence with the appearance of a spectral gap for spin excitations known from the
Bethe Ansatz analysis of the model.
3

The dual ﬁeld must be rescaled in the opposite way to c in order to maintain canonical commutation
5 x relations. This is because
the dual ﬁeld can be expressed in terms of the momentum c conjugate to c as c (t, x) = −8π −∞ d x  c (t, x  ).

302

Asymptotics of correlation functions

Similarly, the effective ﬁeld theory for the repulsive Hubbard model at half ﬁlling is
different from the one discussed above: as we have found before the Hubbard model in this
case has an enlarged symmetry (see Section 2.2.5) and is a Mott insulator with a spectral
gap for charge excitations (denoted as phase V in Section 6.3). In the continuum limit the
additional interaction term (9.6) has to be taken into account. Together with the remaining
charge terms (9.13) this allows to bring the Hamiltonian for the charge degrees of freedom
into an (η-) SU (2)-invariant form similar to (9.19) but with opposite sign of the remaining
current-current interaction [8]. This results in a marginally relevant perturbation of the
charge Hamiltonian which is responsible for the opening of the Mott gap. These matters
are discussed in some detail in Chapter 10.

9.1.3 Bosonization results for correlation functions
For the repulsive Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling we have reformulated the model as
a product of two massless bosonic theories for the charge and spin degrees of freedom
with dispersions ω(q) = vc,s |q|, respectively. This ‘spin-charge separation’ holds for states
near the Fermi level at weak coupling and allows to compute correlation functions of the
Hubbard model. For the case of zero magnetic ﬁeld this extension of the Luttinger liquid
approach has been used by H. J. Schulz [382, 383] and others [70, 372] to compute the
critical exponents of correlation functions for the Hubbard model.
As an example, the electronic Green’s function computed in this approach reads

.
(9.22)
vc2 τ 2 + x 2
(vc τ + i x)(vs τ + i x)
The exponent for the spin-contributions to this correlation function are independent of the
interaction by virtue of the SU (2) symmetry while for the charge contributions we ﬁnd
an interaction-dependent contribution, which is equal to α ! (g/8π v F )2 at weak coupling
(and thus really out of the range of the simple weak-coupling analysis performed above).
Equation (9.22) is derived as follows. We start by rewriting the bosonization formulas (9.11)
in terms of the rescaled ﬁelds c = ϕc + ϕ̄c , c = ϕc − ϕ̄c , see equation (9.15). We have

Now L σ (τ, x) L †σ (0, 0) and Rσ (τ, x) Rσ† (0, 0) are calculated by evaluating the two-point
functions of chiral vertex operators along the lines of Appendix 10.C. This leads to the result
(9.22).

9.2 Conformal ﬁeld theory and ﬁnite-size scaling

303

While the result (9.22) has been derived here for small values of the coupling constant
g only, it will be shown below, that – as a consequence of the absence of spectral gaps –
the result (9.22) is valid universally for the repulsive Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling.
The interaction strength merely determines the numerical values of the velocities vc,s and
the exponent α. These quantities can be calculated directly from the Bethe ansatz as we will
see in what follows.

9.2 Conformal ﬁeld theory and ﬁnite size scaling
In the previous section we have obtained some results for the asymptotic behaviour of
correlation functions by means of an analysis of the low energy effective ﬁeld theory in
the limit of weak coupling. On the other hand we know from the Bethe Ansatz solution
that there is no phase transition induced by the interaction in the repulsive Hubbard model
below half-ﬁlling, in particular the spectrum remains gapless although the nature of the
excitations in presence of the interaction is quite different from what is known for free
electrons.
More general, depending on ﬁlling and external magnetic ﬁeld the repulsive Hubbard
model is found in several phases with one or two massless excitations at zero temperature,
i.e. it has various quantum critical points at T = 0. In such a situation we generally expect
correlation functions to decay as power laws at large distances due to scale invariance.
Furthermore, the critical behaviour should not depend on the details of the underlying
microscopic Hamiltonian but rather be a universal property shared by a large family of
models driven to the same ﬁxed point under renormalization.
Much progress in the description of critical phenomena in 1 + 1 dimensional quantum
systems has been made by the extension of simple scaling arguments through application
of the concepts of conformal quantum ﬁeld theory [51]. Most important in the context of an
exactly solvable model such as the one-dimensional Hubbard model is the existence of one
to one relations between the spectrum of low-lying excitations – which we can compute
with arbitrary precision from the Bethe Ansatz – and quantities related to the universality
class of the system which contain all the information needed to describe the asymptotic
behaviour of correlation functions.

9.2.1 Universality classes
Due to conformal invariance, the universality class of a Lorentz-invariant theory (i.e. a
model with a single ‘velocity of light’ v) is uniquely described by a single dimensionless
number c – the central charge of the underlying Virasoro-algebra. The value of c can be
extracted from the universal ﬁnite size scaling behaviour of the ground state energy of the
model [6, 62, 75]

boundaries. v is the Fermi-velocity. The same mechanism is the origin of a universal term
in the low temperature expansion of the free energy density of the model (β = 1/k B T )

Note that the expression (9.25) is exactly of the form (8.53) found for the leading ﬁnite-size
corrections to the ground state energy of the repulsive Hubbard model at half ﬁlling where
only the charge-neutral spinon excitations are gapless. Hence conformal invariance implies
that the central charge is c = 1 in this phase [489]. This corresponds to a Gaussian model of a
single free boson as is well established and at the heart of the Bosonization method. A similar
situation arises in the attractive Hubbard model. Bogoliubov and Korepin have used this
fact to compute the critical exponents from the ﬁnite-size corrections to the spectrum [65].
Our generic results (8.24) and (8.87) for the ﬁnite size scaling of the ground state energy of
the repulsive Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling, however, do not ﬁt into this simple picture.
This was to be expected since we were dealing with a model having two branches of lowlying excitations with different Fermi velocities. Assuming, however, that charge and spin
excitations are independent of each other we can interprete the scaling of the ground state
energy in the framework of conformal quantum ﬁeld theory as the result of a critical theory
based on a product of two Virasoro algebras each having central charge c = 1 [140, 141].
The same interpretation can be drawn from the comparison of the conformal prediction
(9.27) with the low-temperature expansion of the free energy of the Hubbard model (see
equation (13.207) below). While this separation into two independent CFTs appears trivial
for the discussion above (where we simply count critical degrees of freedom) it has dramatic
consequences for correlation functions (9.1):
As we have seen in Chapter 7 the nature of the low-lying excitations in the Hubbard model
changes when we modify the parameters of the model: the holons and spinons which make
up the excitation spectrum at vanishing magnetic ﬁeld change into fermionic quasi-particles
and magnons near the saturation ﬁeld. Hence the decomposition of a physical operator into
its constituents from the two conformal ﬁeld theories will depend continuously on these
parameters. This has immediate consequences on the analytic properties of the correlation
functions: instead of simple quasi particle poles we shall ﬁnd branch cuts with properties
depending on the electron density, magnetic ﬁeld and interaction strength – as is already
indicated in the perturbative result (9.22) for the Green’s function at weak coupling.
Unfortunately, for a CFT with central charge c ≥ 1 the critical exponents related to these
singularities are not ﬁxed by universality. If no additional constraints – e.g. due to symmetry –
are present one has to analyze the ﬁnite size scaling of the low-lying excitations (those
becoming gapless in the thermodynamic limit) of the one-dimensional quantum system in

9.2 Conformal ﬁeld theory and ﬁnite-size scaling

305

addition to that of the ground state energy to obtain information on the precise nature of
these singularities.

9.2.2 Low-lying excitations and correlation functions
As a consequence of global scale invariance in a Lorentz invariant system without an
internal scale e.g. due to a spectral gap, a correlation function such as (9.1) has to decay
algebraically. In the simplest case the two-point correlation functions – when considered in
the entire complex plane – decay as simple power laws (z i = vτi − i xi )

(9.28)

Conformal invariance extends the invariance under global scale transformations (i.e.
translations and rotations) to local ones. This has two consequences: ﬁrst it allows to classify
all possible universality classes as discussed above, second it allows to relate geometries
different from the extended complex plane to each other. Under a conformal transformation
z → w = w(z) the (holomorphic part of the) correlation function (9.28) becomes

and similarly for the antiholomorphic part D̄(z̄ 1 , z̄ 2 ). The additional local factors appearing
in the correlation functions may be interpreted as the transformation properties of the
corresponding operators O. A particularly useful transformation is
w(z) = exp(2π z/L) ,

(9.30)

which maps the strip −L < Im(z) ≤ 0 to the complex plane [6, 62, 74]. Equation (9.29)
enables us to compute the correlation function of ﬁnite quantum chains of length L or

scaling dimensions and spins of the operators in the conformal ﬁeld theory and the ﬁnite

Thus, provided that we have reliable results (either from an exact solution or by numerical
methods) on the ﬁnite size scaling of low-lying excitations in a 1 + 1 dimensional quantum model with a single branch of gapless excitations we can determine the asymptotic
behaviour of correlation functions without the need of using perturbative methods. All the
effects of interactions will lead to a renormalization of the ﬁnite-size scaling properties –
or equivalently of certain thermodynamic quantities, see Chapter 8.4 – of the system. The
additional step relating these quantities to the critical exponents in correlation functions
relies on the principles of conformal invariance alone. What remains is the identiﬁcation of

the operators appearing in the CFT relevant for the correlation function of a given operator
in the lattice model.
9.2.3 Extension to models with several critical degrees of freedom
While the correspondence (9.35) can be directly applied to the discussion of the phases of
the Hubbard model with a single critical degree of freedom, such as the Hubbard model
at half-ﬁlling, the generic result (8.36), (8.38) for the spectrum of low-lying excitations
of the repulsive Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling does not ﬁt into this picture. As in the
discussion of the universality classes based on the ﬁnite size scaling behaviour of the ground
state energy in Section 9.2.1 a suitable generalization has to be found [140, 141].
Following our interpretation of the scaling (8.24) of the ground state energy as signature
of a critical theory based on a product of two Virasoro algebras we generalize (9.35) to

Comparing equations (8.36) with (9.37) we obtain unique expressions for the conformal

scaling dimensions (i.e. the sums dc,s = +
c,s − c,s ) characteristic of the charge and spin
part of the ﬁelds in this theory as functions of the elements of the dressed charge matrix (8.29). On the other hand, the comparison of the ﬁnite-size momenta (8.38) with
the corresponding expression in (9.37) only provides the sum of the conformal spins
−
±
sc,s = +
c,s − c,s . The additional requirement that all the dimensions c,s be non negative resolves this ﬁnal problem (otherwise there would be unphysical divergences in the
correlation functions). This requirement is met by writing the dimensions as complete

In general, the individual conformal spins sc,s deﬁned by these expressions will depend
on the system parameters and take arbitrary real values. This gives rise to the unusual
analytic properties of correlation functions in correlated one-dimensional systems. Physical
operators, however, cannot have arbitrary spin. Therefore, the combined conformal spin
sc + ss of the charge and spin part of a physical operator has to be integer or half-odd
integer. As can be seen from (8.38) this is always the case.
Finally, we modify the conformal ﬁeld theory expression for the correlation function of
a primary ﬁeld (9.36) to the case where these operators contain factors from two different

At small ﬁnite temperature T > 0 the correlation functions decay exponentially, however

ﬁeld theory for the computation of correlation functions from ﬁnite-size spectra to models
with two or more critical degrees of freedom – the case of two branches of gapless excitations
considered here is easily generalized to more general situations (see e.g. [143, 145, 216]).
As a ﬁnal remark we note that marginally irrelevant perturbations to a conformal ﬁeld
theory – such as the current current interactions which we have neglected in the perturbative
analysis in Section 9.1.2 – can produce logarithmic corrections to the conformal predictions
for correlation functions [10, 137]. In the spectrum they are manifest through ﬁnite size
effects of order 1/(L ln L) in (9.25), (9.35) [75]. In principle, these can also be calculated
explicitly from the Bethe Ansatz equations, but this is beyond the scope of the present
discussion.

9.3 Correlation functions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model
In the previous section we have established relations between the correlation functions of
certain operators in the effective ﬁeld theory describing the low-energy sector of a given
microscopic model and the ﬁnite-size scaling of the low-lying states in this model. This
determines the set of all possible correlation functions within the microscopic model. This
is a notable achievement, but still doesn’t address the problem one is usually faced with,
namely to compute the asymptotic behaviour of, say, the density-density correlation function
of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. The missing step would be to express a given local
operator in the microscopic model in terms of the operators appearing in the conformal
ﬁeld theory (whose correlation functions we know to be (9.36) or (9.39)). This expansion

9.3 Correlation functions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model

is not known usually. Hence without additional input all one can say is that the correlation
function in the microscopic model is a superposition of contributions from all operators
appearing in the CFT with unknown – possible vanishing – coefﬁcients.
Fortunately, the number of terms in such an expansion can be reduced drastically by
using the selection rules for the form factors q|O(x)| of the microscopic operator O
appearing in (9.34).
As an illustration of this scheme let us describe how to obtain the asymptotical behaviour
of the density-density correlations
G nn (τ, x) = n(τ, x)n(0, 0)

(9.41)

for the repulsive Hubbard model below half ﬁlling5 in the Euclidean region: The leading
term is a constant since n(τ, x) = n c . Since the local density operator does not change the
number of particles we have to use (9.38), (9.39) at Nc = Ns = 0 for the higher terms
contributing to G nn . The restrictions of equations (8.39) are satisﬁed for any integer Dc , Ds .
Hence the next terms in the asymptotic expansion of G nn are found to be

Using the fact that the Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model is invariant under the action
of the parity operator R L (2.46) the ground state is an eigenstate of R L and, consequently,
G nn (τ, x) ≡ G nn (τ, −x) .

(9.45)

From this property it follows that the phases ϕk in the general expression (9.42) for the
density-density correlation function actually vanish.
The general procedure outlined above is applicable for each of the phases of the Hubbard
model with gapless excitations. In each case the relevant selection rules have to be determined. A listing of the selection rules of the repulsive Hubbard model below half-ﬁlling
relevant to the two-point correlation functions of various operators is given in table 9.1. In
general this approach gives the critical exponents as functions of the entries of the matrix Z
(8.29). The numerical values of these coefﬁcients are easily obtained by numerical solution
of the integral equations (8.31). As we have seen in Chapter 8 this matrix simpliﬁes in
various special cases which we shall consider in more detail below.

9.3.1 Zero magnetic ﬁeld
In Section 8.2.1 we have studied the ﬁnite size spectrum of the repulsive Hubbard model for
B = 0 below half-ﬁlling. As a consequence of SU (2) symmetry in the magnetic sector the
only non-universal quantity apart from the Fermi velocities was the element Z cc = ξ (z 0 ) of
the dressed charge matrix (8.42) which has been computed analytically in various limiting
cases. This fact allows to simplify the expression for the conformal dimensions (9.38)

different from integers or half-odd integers reﬂecting the fact that only the product of
the corresponding holon and spinon operators are physical ﬁelds (recall our discussion
following equation (9.38).
As an additional simpliﬁcation for vanishing magnetic ﬁeld, the Fermi momenta for spin
up and spin down electrons are identical k F,↑ = k F,↓ = π n c /2 ≡ k F . This leads to various
simpliﬁcations in the expressions for the correlation functions compared to the general form
given for G nn above. Below we express the critical exponents as functions of θ = 2ξ (z 0 )2 .
From equation (8.50) we know that for any density 0 < n c < 1 the value of θ increases
from 2 to 4 as the Coulomb repulsion u decreases from ∞ to 0 (see ﬁgure 9.2).
Density correlations. From (9.42) we obtain for the asymptotic behaviour of the densitydensity correlation function (we use the observation (9.45) on the parity of the correlator):

Because of the range of variation of θ the leading correction beyond the constant term
is the term ∝ A1 for all ﬁnite u. Unlike these oscillations with wave number 2k F which
also appear in a free electron gas, 4k F -oscillations are a consequence of the interactions,

More precisely, only the spin velocity depends on the system parameters.

Asymptotics of correlation functions

i.e. A2 → 0 for u → 0. In the strong coupling limit, at u = ∞, the effect of the Hubbard
interaction on electrons with different spin is identical to the Pauli exclusion principle for
electrons with the same spin. This allows an alternative description of the charge dynamics
of the Hubbard model in this limit in terms of noninteracting spinless fermions where k F
has to be replaced by 2k F [344]. Hence the amplitude A1 has to vanish in this limit and the
leading oscillating contribution to the correlation function is the term ∝ A2 , namely

As in our argument leading to (9.45) for the density-density correlation function the transformation properties of the spin operators under parity imply that
G aσ σ (τ, x) = G aσ σ (τ, −x) ,

a =⊥, z ,

(9.49)

and hence ϕ = ϕ  = 0 in (9.48).
As for the density correlations above, the leading contribution asymptotically is that
at wavenumber 2k F for any non-zero u. The k = 0-behaviour of G ⊥
σ σ is determined by
1
the contribution due to the choice Dc = ± 2 and Ds = ∓1. This leads to the conformal
+
−
dimensions ±
c = 0 and (s , s ) = (0, 1) and (1, 0) of the SU (2) spin current which is a
primary ﬁeld.
In absence of a magnetic ﬁeld the longitudinal and the transverse spin-spin correlations
should be identical due to the spin-SU (2) symmetry of the Hubbard model (see Chapter 2).
Simple application of the selection rules from table 9.1 for the G σz σ results a form identical
to that of the density density correlator (9.47) – up to the numerical values of the amplitudes.
That the expected symmetry is not transparent should come as no surprise since the presence
of the spin-SU (2) has not been used at all up to this point: in our general scheme the selection
rules for the terms contributing to the correlation function of a given local operator are
based only on the conservation of electron numbers with spins up and down. The spinSU (2) symmetry does lead to additional selection rules for the form factors q|S z (0)| as
compared to those of the local density. At zero magnetic ﬁeld, B = 0, the ground state |
of the Hubbard model is an SU (2)-singlet. The matrix elements

determine which intermediate states |q can contribute to the asymptotic behaviour of

S#2 S1z | = S#2 , S1z | = 2 S1z | .
(9.51)
This shows that S1z | is a triplet of the spin-SU (2). As a consequence, only intermediate
states which are spin-triplets and have S z = 0 can contribute to G σz σ for B = 0. It follows from the highest-weight property (3.99) that these states are not Bethe Ansatz states!
However, due to the completeness of the Bethe Ansatz (see Chapter 4), the corresponding energies are found in the S z = 1-sector. Hence, the energies of the states |q with
non-vanishing form factors (9.50) are obtained from the ﬁnite-size spectrum (8.36) with
(Nc , Ns ) = (0, −1) and the allowed values for Dcs, as given by equation (8.39). To
summarize, we ﬁnd that for zero magnetic ﬁeld, B = 0, the selection rules for the conformal dimensions contributing to the longitudinal spin correlation function G σz σ are – as a
consequence of the spin-SU (2) symmetry of the system and the fact that the ground state
of the repulsive Hubbard model is a spin singlet – identical to those for the transversal spin

This is an example for the effect of the conformal spins of the charge and spin part of an
operator not being integer or half integer separately: both sc and ss are 14 for the ﬁrst term
which produces the branch cut singularities in the correlation function. In the limit u → 0
the velocities vc and vs coincide and the singularities cancel each other producing the usual
quasi particle pole in the Green’s function.
The anomalous exponent α1 = 1/θ + θ/16 − 1/2 which determines the singularity of
the term oscillating with k F is a monotonically growing function of u with α1 (u = 0) = 0
and α1 (u → ∞) = 18 (see ﬁgure 9.3). Using our result (8.49) for the small-u behaviour of
ξ (z 0 ) we ﬁnd that α1 = (u/2π sin(Q))2 in agreement with the weak coupling result (9.22)
from bosonization. This result shows one of the striking consequences of the interaction

in the one-dimensional Hubbard model – and in fact any one-dimensional system within
the universality class of the so-called Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid: according to (9.A.11) the
momentum distribution function of the electrons which is just the Fourier transformation
of the equal time ﬁeld-ﬁeld correlation function (9.53) has an algebraic singularity at the
Fermi points ±k F :
n(k) =

for k ≈ k F .

(9.54)

This is in contrast to the usual zero temperature Fermi distribution function with a step at k F
(corresponding to α1 = 0): this is a consequence of the enhancement of quantum ﬂuctuations
in a one-dimensional quantum system due to correlations. Increasing the interaction strength
further7 does lead to even larger ﬂuctuation effects (corresponding to larger values of α1 ).
Similarly as with the 4k F singularity in G nn , the interaction gives rise to new singularities
of the Green’s function oscillating with odd multiples of the Fermi momentum k F . This is an
indication for the fact that the electrons are not the elementary excitations in the interacting
system but rather scattering states of multiple holons and anti-holons. The exponent of the
ﬁrst such singularity, α3 = 1/θ + 9θ/16 − 3/2, decreases from 1 to 18 as u goes from 0 to
∞. This result holds at any density n c below half-ﬁlling (see ﬁgure 9.4).

9.3.2 Half-ﬁlled band
From our previous analysis we know that at half ﬁlling, n c = 1, only charge-neutral excitations are gapless. Therefore only these states show up in the ﬁnite-size spectra computed
7

Within the Hubbard model this is not possible beyond u = ∞. With an additional nearest-neighbour interaction, however, α1
can increase beyond 1/8 [382].

should note, that the momentum of the intermediate state is now given by 2Ds k F,↓ for states

We start our discussion of the correlation functions at half-ﬁlling with the spin-spin
correlators which we expect to decay algebraically based on our previous ﬁndings. Again
we will express the critical exponents in terms of θs = 2ξs (A)2 which grows from 1 for
vanishing magnetic ﬁeld to 2 for h = h c . Using the methods introduced above the leading

where ν = 2 − θs − 1/θs and we have used (9.49). In absence of a magnetic ﬁeld the

correlations are isotropic and the staggered part decays like A1 cos(π x/a0 )/x at equal times.

316

Asymptotics of correlation functions

As mentioned above, marginally irrelevant perturbations to a conformal ﬁeld theory lead to
logarithmic corrections to these expressions. For example, the coefﬁcient A1 in the equal
time spin-spin correlation functions at h = 0 has been found to be [137]
3
A1 ∝ ln |x|.
(9.57)
(The same result has been obtained for the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet in
Ref. [10].)
For the analysis of density correlation functions we have to extend our approach for the
computation of critical exponents from the ﬁnite-size spectrum to make full use of the full
set of symmetries present at half ﬁlling. Just using the selection rules of conservation of
numbers of electrons with spin up and down, G nn would show the same algebraic decay as
the longitudinal spin correlator in (9.56a) with different amplitudes Ai . Using the modiﬁed
selection rules in the presence of the η-SU (2) in the charge sector at half-ﬁlling we will
now show that all the amplitudes of such algebraically decaying contributions to G nn do
actually vanish [118]. Quantitative results on the dynamical correlation functions involving
charge degrees of freedom can be obtained in a particular continuum limit of the Hubbard
model (see Chapter 10).
At half ﬁlling the ground state | of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is an S O(4)singlet for magnetic ﬁeld B = 0 [120, 293]. In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld the ground
state (in the half-ﬁlled band) remains a singlet of the η-pairing SU (2). From (2.80c)
the electronic density operator can be expressed in terms of the local generators of the
η-pairing SU (2) as η z (τ, x) = 12 (n(τ, x) − 1). Hence the connected density correlation
function is
G nn (τ, x) = 4 η z (τ, x)η z (0, 0)

(9.58)

q|η1z |

(9.59)

and the matrix elements

(η1z is the generator of the local η-pairing SU (2) at site 1 of the lattice) determine which
intermediate states |q will contribute to the asymptotic behaviour of G nn .
The calculation of the total η-spin quantum number of the state η1z | is identical to
that in (9.51): the commutation relations (2.81) between the η-pairing operators and the
fact that | is a singlet under the η-pairing SU(2) imply that this state is a triplet of the
η-pairing SU (2). As a consequence, only intermediate states which are η-pairing triplets
can contribute to the correlation function G nn at half-ﬁlling.
In Chapter 7 we have shown that only pure spin excitations are gapless in the repulsive
half-ﬁlled Hubbard model. These are all singlets of the η-pairing SU (2). Therefore the
corresponding matrix elements (9.59) vanish identically and cannot contribute in G nn .
We conclude that the lowest-energy intermediate states with non-zero matrix elements
(9.59) are holon-antiholon scattering states with energy above the Mott-Hubbard gap. As a
result the density-density correlation function exhibits exponential decay at large distances

The determination of α(u) is an interesting open problem. On general grounds it can be
expected to be proportional to the holon gap (see Section 7.2). In the scaling limit (see
Chapter 10) this is indeed the case.
We emphasize that to establish the exponential decay of the density-density correlation
function G nn in the above way it has been essential that:8
(i) There is an exact symmetry in the charge sector of the microscopic Hamiltonian (2.22).
For the Hubbard model this is the η-pairing SU (2). For extended versions of the
Hubbard model the existence of such a symmetry has to be established.
(ii) The ground state is a singlet of the corresponding algebra. Note that the above considerations still hold in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld as the ground state (in the
half-ﬁlled band) remains a singlet of the η-pairing SU (2).
(iii) All charged (non-singlet) excitations are gapped.
(ps)

If one would consider correlation functions of ‘point-split’ densities such as N j =
 †
σ c jσ c j+1,σ the above symmetry argument does not imply the vanishing of e.g. the matrix
(ps)

element ST|N1 | , where |ST denotes a spin-triplet excitation. Given that symmetry
does not force such matrix elements to vanish we expect them to be nonzero, which then
( ps)
immediately implies an algebraic decay of the corresponding correlation function G nn as
in (9.56a).
Analogous conclusions can be reached for spin-spin correlations in the attractive Hubbard
model. Application of the Shiba-transformation (2.59) changes the sign of the interaction
in the Hamiltonian (2.22), whereas η-pairing and spin SU (2) symmetries are interchanged.
Furthermore the ground state of the attractive Hubbard model is a spin singlet. This implies
that spin-spin correlation functions in the attractive Hubbard model decay exponentially at
large distances

where β > 0 for any u < 0.

9.3.3 Magnetic ﬁeld effects in the strong coupling limit
As we have seen in Section 8.2.4, the strong coupling limit of the repulsive Hubbard
model allows for a detailed study of the dependence of the excitation spectrum and hence
the critical exponents on the magnetic ﬁeld. Apart from this, there exists an independent
method for the calculation of correlation functions in this limit [344,345,353]: For u → ∞,
the Bethe Ansatz wave functions take a particularly simple form which allows to evaluate
8

We note that these conditions are fulﬁlled for the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice in any dimension, provided
that u is larger than the critical Mott-Hubbard value [293].

correlation functions directly. The numerical and analytical (at quarter ﬁlling and B = 0)
results obtained within this approach are in perfect agreement with the conformal ﬁeld
theory approach used here.
As a most remarkable result of our investigation of the ﬁnite size spectrum in the strong
coupling limit we found that the dressed charge matrix exhibited two very different dependencies on the external ﬁeld. This has an interesting consequence on the conformal
dimensions (9.38) entering the expressions for the correlation functions [141]: For a small

Hence the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the critical dimensions for the charge-excitations
is much weaker than that of the spin-excitations. This is not surprising since the magnetic
ﬁeld couples directly to the spin degree of freedom. In general, the exponents of equal
time correlators (where only the sum of c and s enters) will be dominated by the latter,
in time-dependent quantities, however, this effect should become observable. The (weak)
B-dependence of the charge exponents shows, however, that their spin and charge are not
completely independent. In fact, the conformal spins are dependent on the external magnetic
ﬁeld. According to our discussion above this is another signature of the mutation of holons
and spinons as B varies.
The presence of a magnetic ﬁeld does not change the general form of the correlators as
determined within the CFT approach, i.e. they are again a sum of terms (9.39) which have
to be selected according to the selection rules of the operator considered. We do have to
consider the Green’s functions for spin-up and spin-down electrons separately in principle.
It turns out however, that for small magnetic ﬁelds there is a simple mapping between the

(Here we have neglected contributions of order O(1 − B/Bc )).
At B ≥ Bc a phase transition similar to the one found at half ﬁlling occurs: excitations
with spin develop a gap and the corresponding contributions to the correlation functions
decay like exponentials asymptotically. The other excitations involve only spin-up electrons and remain massless. They can lead to algebraically decaying correlation functions. For the Hubbard model these are identical to those of non-interacting spinless
fermions.
9.4 Correlation functions in momentum space
For experimental and other applications one is often interested in the Fourier transforms of
two-point correlation functions. Their low-energy asymptotics can be determined by Fourier
transforming the large-distance behaviour obtained above. Here we discuss the results of
such a procedure for some particular examples.
9.4.1 Spectral function
The spectral function A(ω, k) is obtained from the imaginary part of the retarded single
particle Green’s function

following Refs. [309, 323, 472] and is summarized in the Appendix to Chapter 18 of the

(9.71) comes from the k F and 3k F harmonics of the asymptotic form of the Green’s function
(9.53). In particular, we have

A(ω, k F + q) are the holon-spinon excitation at ω < 0 and the antiholon-spinon excitation
at ω > 0. They are shown in ﬁgures 7.34 and 7.33 respectively.
The two peaks in A(ω, k F + q) dispersing with velocities vs and vc respectively are a
direct manifestation of spin-charge separation. The peaks are power-law singularities with
interaction-dependent exponents (9.74) rather than δ-functions or Lorentzians. The spectral
function of the Hubbard model is dramatically different from the one of noninteracting
electrons. The latter is simply
Afree (ω, k F + q) = δ(ω − v F q).

(9.82)

An important question is in which interval of momentum transfers q the results
(9.80), (9.81) can be trusted. A useful criterion is obtained by considering how good the

324

Asymptotics of correlation functions

linear approximations to the dispersions of the spin and charge excitations are. In ﬁgure 9.6
we show the linear approximations to the dressed energies ε1 and κ, see Section 7.7. We
see that the approximations are good as long as the momentum does not deviate more than
about |π/8| from the value for which the energies vanish. Hence the results (9.80),(9.81)
may be trusted as long as |qa0 | < π/8.
9.4.2 Dynamical structure factor
The components of the dynamical structure factor S αβ (ω, k) are measured by inelastic
neutron scattering. They are deﬁned in terms of the dynamical spin susceptibility by

correlation function χ αβ (ω, k) as usual by analytically continuing the Fourier transform of
the correlator in imaginary time τ = it, i.e. the Euclidean correlator, see e.g. [4].
From now on we set the magnetic ﬁeld equal to zero in order to keep the discussion
simple. Due to spin rotational symmetry we have

χ αβ (ω, k) = δ αβ χ ⊥ (ω, k).

(9.85)

As can be seen from the results for the spectrum of spin-excitations below half ﬁlling in
ﬁgure 7.32 there are gapless excitations at k ≈ 0, k ≈ 2k F and k ≈ 4k F . In the vicinity of
these momenta we may estimate the dynamical structure factor as follows. The asymptotics of the spin-spin correlation function in Euclidean space are given in (9.48). Fourier
transforming and analytically continuing to real frequencies along the lines discussed in
Appendix 9.A we obtain

For a less than half ﬁlled band we have always θ > 2 (see ﬁgure 9.2). Hence, the contribution
(9.86) to the dynamical structure factor in the vicinity of 2k F is always non-singular and will
be modiﬁed by additional non-singular terms which are not accessible within the conformal
approach. The same is found near k = 0 and 4k F . At half ﬁlling however, the structure
factor is singular in the vicinity of 2k F . This case is discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.
9.5 Correlation functions in the open boundary Hubbard chain
In Section 8.3 we have seen how various interesting quantities such as local expectation
values of certain operators could be computed from the exact solution of the Hubbard

9.5 Correlation functions in the open boundary Hubbard chain

325

model with open boundary conditions. Furthermore, we were able to calculate the ﬁnite
size corrections to the energies of low-lying excitations in this situation which – when combined with the techniques of conformal ﬁeld theory – can be used to study new correlation
functions. Since practically every experiment deals with systems of ﬁnite extension, either
due to the geometry of the probe or due to the presence of imperfections, this opens new
possibilities for the identiﬁcation of the special properties of one-dimensional correlated
electron systems in the real world.
Here we shall discuss two phenomena in more detail, namely Friedel oscillations [147]
and Anderson’s orthogonality catastrophy [17] in the open Hubbard model. Further applications of these methods to the Hubbard model, e.g. Fermi edge singularities appearing in
X-ray scattering experiments or in the I –V characteristics of tunneling experiments have
been discussed elsewhere [50, 117]. Similar results have been obtained for the Luttinger
model using the Bosonization method [13, 114, 346, 351, 369, 501].

9.5.1 Friedel oscillations
In the presence of an impurity or boundary in a one-dimensional fermion system the translational invariance is broken leading to an inhomogeneous density distribution – so-called
Friedel oscillations in the densities with wavenumber 2k F [147], i.e.
n(x) − n c ∼

cos(2k F x + ϕ)
xγ

(9.87)

with an exponent γ depending on the interaction. There have been various attempts using
both numerical and analytical methods to clarify the role of the interaction [114, 130, 378,
398].
It was shown by Cardy that the n-point correlation functions of a conformal ﬁeld theory
with a boundary are related to the 2n-point bulk correlation functions of this system [73]. As a
consequence the local density n(x) open of the open boundary system can be extracted from
the two-point density-density correlation function G nn of the periodic system considered
above (see also [478]).
Following Ref. [73] we have to consider the antiholomorphic part D̄(z̄ 1 , z̄ 2 ) of the twopoint bulk correlation function (9.28) of the primary operator O(z, z̄) in the conformal ﬁeld
theory. Then the one-point correlation function of this operator in the semi-inﬁnite geometry
is just
+

O(z, z̄) ∝ D̄(z̄, z) = (z̄ − z)−2 .

(9.88)

The oscillating factor has to be taken from the corresponding bulk current-current correlation
function ((9.36) or (9.39)).

326

Asymptotics of correlation functions

Using this we obtain the leading asymptotic oscillating contributions to the local density

(9.89)

The correlation function G σz σ (τ, x) has the same functional form as the density-density
correlator. Therefore, the CFT prediction for the oscillations in the local magnetization
m(x) contains the same terms as n(x) but different amplitudes Ai .
The critical exponents in (9.89) depend on the elements Z i j of the dressed charge. Since
Z is a bulk quantity only the density of electrons, the strength of the interaction and of the
magnetic ﬁeld have an inﬂuence on the exponents. Similarly, the amplitudes Ai should not
depend on the strength of the boundary potential. However, just as in the case of periodic
boundary conditions, a prediction on the dependence of the different amplitudes Ai in the
correlation function is beyond the capabilities of the CFT approach. Only in the limit of
noninteracting electrons are their values known from the exact expression for this correlation
function (n̄ is the average bulk density of electrons corrected by the ﬁnite size shifts due to
the boundaries: n̄ = n c − θ/L)

and A3 = 0 for u → 0.
from which we expect A1 = A2 = 2π
In Ref. [48] an extensive numerical study of this correlation function has been performed
using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to compute n(x) and
m(x) for chains of length up to L = 500 sites (see ﬁgure 9.7). This study has conﬁrmed
the predictions of conformal ﬁeld theory for the critical exponents and provided information on the interaction dependence of the amplitudes Ai . The numerical results have
shown that – in perfect agreement with the predictions from the Bethe Ansatz and conformal ﬁeld theory – the critical exponents are determined by the dressed charge matrix,
independent of the boundary conditions; in particular they do not depend on the boundary
potential p. At the same time no signiﬁcant p-dependence of the amplitudes Ai could be
observed.
Finally, the analysis of the DMRG results has provided strong evidence for the conjecture
that the ﬁnite size shift of the average bulk density of electrons due to boundary ﬁelds and,
similarly, the wave numbers of the Friedel oscillations is given by the phase shifts (8.91)
appearing in the analysis of the Bethe Ansatz equations of the open boundary system, i.e.

with open boundary conditions.

u – at 2kn ≡ 2k F↑ + 2k F↓ . The amplitude corresponding to k = 0 is not shown.

9.5.2 Orthogonality catastrophe
This problem deals with the system size dependence of the overlap of the many-particle
ground states of two systems differing only in the choice of the boundary potential [17]. To
study this one has to consider operators changing the boundary conditions of a system [9,13].
Let O p (ζ ) be such an operator with ζ a point on the boundary of a given complex region.
The action of O p is to switch from one boundary condition A (parametrized by p A = 0)
left of ζ to a boundary condition B corresponding to a parameter p B ≡ p right of ζ .
Following Afﬂeck [9] we consider the conformal transformation z̄ → w̄(z̄) = exp(π z̄/L)
to obtain a relation between the correlation functions in the inﬁnite strip 0 ≤ Im(z̄) ≤ L
of width L to those in the upper half-plane w̄ = u + iv, v ≥ 0. In the latter geometry, the
correlation function of the primary boundary operator O p decays as a simple power law
(let 0 < u 1 < u 2 )
O p (u 1 )O†p (u 2 ) =

(9.92)

To make contact with the integrable boundary conditions realized in the one-dimensional
Hubbard model we now identify the boundary condition A with that of a reﬂecting end
or boundary ﬁelds p = 0 in the Hamiltonian (8.70) and B with that of a ﬁnite boundary
potential p. Applying the transformation given above to (9.92) and identifying the imaginary
part of z with the spatial variable as before we obtain a correlation function in the strip

The key to the correct identiﬁcation of the orthogonality exponent is the proper choice
of the parameters Ni in (8.88) (see also Ref. [49]): as has been argued in Section 8.3.4
the ground state energy E 0A A is obtained by taking Ni = θi ( p = 0) (see equation (8.90)).
In the expression (9.97) for the orthogonality exponent we have to compare this energy
with that of a different state, namely E 0B A . It is crucial for the correct computation of the
critical exponent in this approach to compute all ﬁnite-size corrections with respect to
the same reference state. Since selection rules dictate that |0 and | p are states with the
same particle numbers N and M this implies that one has to choose Ni = θi ( p = 0) in
E 0B A , too.9

This argument can be veriﬁed by considering the case of the completely spin-polarized band of the Hubbard model in a sufﬁciently

Since the parameter ξ has been identiﬁed as the contribution of the holon sector to the
anomalous critical exponents of the Hubbard model this implies that there are no contributions from the spinon sector to the orthogonality exponent due to a change in the boundary
chemical potential. In the limit p → ∞, i.e. switching between vanishing and very strong
boundary potential the orthogonality exponent becomes a function of the difference between the bulk density of electrons n c and the occupation (n 1 = 2) of the boundary site in

conformal ﬁeld theory a change of the potential at both boundaries cannot be achieved by
the action of a single local boundary changing operator O pp . Instead, a product of two such
operators has to be considered. This becomes obvious when one switches back from the

Scaling and continuum limits at half-ﬁlling

At half-ﬁlling the repulsive Hubbard model is in a Mott insulating phase. The charge
degrees of freedom are gapped, whereas the spin degrees of freedom remain gapless. At
low energies the spin sector is actually scale invariant (apart from logarithmic corrections)
and Conformal Field Theory (CFT) methods may be applied to determine the low-energy
behaviour of correlation functions involving only the spin sector. On the other hand, the
charge sector is not scale invariant and CFT does not provide any information for correlators
involving the charge degrees of freedom. In this chapter we will show that there exists a
particular continuum limit of the half ﬁlled Hubbard model, in which it is possible to
calculate dynamical correlation functions by means of methods of integrable quantum ﬁeld
theory. We ﬁrst construct a Lorentz invariant scaling limit starting from the results for the
excitation spectrum and the S-matrix discussed in Chapter 7. This scaling limit is identiﬁed
as the SU(2) Thirring model, which is an integrable relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. Next
we discuss a continuum limit, which is obtained directly from the Hubbard Hamiltonian
and describes the vicinity of the scaling limit.
10.1 Construction of the scaling limit
The simplest way of constructing the scaling limit is to start with the results for the dispersions of the elementary excitations and the S-matrix derived in Chapter 7 and then
look for a particular limit in which Lorentz invariance is recovered. This was done for the
attractive Hubbard model by E. Melzer in Ref. [324] using the results of [120, 121] for
the excitation spectrum and the S-matrix of the half ﬁlled Hubbard model. A somewhat
different path, based on the physical Bethe Ansatz equations (see Section 7.5), was taken
by F. Woynarovich and P. Forgacs in [490, 491]. We will construct the scaling limit in the
repulsive regime of the half ﬁlled Hubbard model following Melzer’s work.
The basic idea behind both the scaling and continuum limits is most easily explained
by considering the dispersion relations (7.8) for the elementary (anti)holon and spinon
excitations. It is clear from ﬁgures 7.2 that the (anti)holon gap becomes very small for
small u. Hence in the charge sector we have low-energy holon modes in the vicinity of
Ph = − π2 and low-energy antiholon modes around Ph̄ = π2 . In the spin sector there are
gapless modes at Ps = 0, π. In the scaling and continuum limits we concentrate on these
333

334

Scaling and continuum limits at half-ﬁlling

low-energy modes only. It turns out that Lorentz invariance emerges as a symmetry of these
low-energy degrees of freedom.
On a more formal level, the continuum limit is usually based on taking the hopping t to
inﬁnity and simultaneously the lattice spacing a0 to zero, while keeping the Fermi velocity
v F = 2ta0 ﬁxed.1 The scaling limit is obtained by taking in addition u = U/4t to zero,
while keeping the charge gap ﬁxed

The limits (10.2), (10.3) can be derived in the same way as (6.B.10), see [324]. Inspection

scale k to ±π in a particular way

(10.9)

Equations (10.9) are the standard parametrization of a Lorentz invariant massless dispersion
in terms of a rapidity variable β
εs = v F | ps |.

(10.10)

We note that scaling  to ±2 is not a unique choice, but it is the most natural in the sense
that the scale appearing in the parametrization (10.9) is a physical quantity, namely the
single particle gap M.
The analysis above establishes that the scaling limit of the half ﬁlled Hubbard model is
a Lorentz invariant scattering theory of massive (anti)holons and massless spinons.

10.2 The S-matrix in the scaling limit
Having obtained Lorentz invariant dispersions for (anti)holons and spinons in the scaling
limit, the next step is to determine their respective S-matrices.

10.2.1 Massive charge sector
Our starting point is the SU(2) invariant S-matrix (7.134) describing scattering of holons
and antiholons. Scaling the momenta of the holes to ±π according to (10.4), we ﬁnd

Scaling and continuum limits at half-ﬁlling

model [55]. We note that the SU(2) Thirring model is also known as Chiral Gross Neveu
model in the literature.2
The fact that the S-matrix tends to ∓i when the rapidity difference approaches ±∞
seems to be at odds with physical intuition, which suggests that the amplitude of purely
elastic scattering ought to tend to 1 in these limits (which correponds to the Mandelstam
variable s going to inﬁnity). The unusual asymptotic behaviour of the S-matrix signiﬁes
that holons have fractional (exchange) statistics. For many calculations it is convenient to
introduce Hilbert spaces of auxiliary ‘in’ and ‘out’ particles with ordinary statistics [236,
416, 428] and work with auxiliary particles instead of the physical particles with fractional
statistics.

10.2.2 Massless spin sector
In the spin sector we have to scale the spectral parameters according to equation (10.8). We
have to distinguish between three cases.
Scattering of right movers on right movers. Both 1h and 2h are in the vicinity of 2 and
describe right-moving spinons. This is apparent from the fact that their momentum is always
positive. The scaling limit for the difference of spectral parameters of the holes is

In the literature the massive sector in the SU(2) Thirring model is often referred to as the ‘spin’ sector. This should not be
confused with the spin sector in the underlying Hubbard model.

10.3 Continuum limit

337

The S-matrices (10.14)–(10.16) agree with the ones derived for the SU1 (2) Wess-ZuminoNovikov-Witten model in Ref. [504].3

10.2.3 Scattering between spin and charge
The scattering between spin and charge is diagonal and rapidity independent
S̃γα11γα22 (θ, β) = −i δα1 γ1 δα2 γ2 .

(10.17)

Hence spin and charge degrees of freedom are essentially decoupled in the scaling limit.

10.3 Continuum limit
In the previous section we have seen that there exists a particular scaling limit, in which the
half ﬁlled Hubbard model becomes equivalent to an integrable quantum ﬁeld theory, the
SU(2) Thirring model. An obvious question is whether this relationship can be established
directly on the level of the Hamiltonian, by taking an appropriate continuum limit. As we
will see this indeed turns out to be the case. As the interaction strength U/t goes to zero in
the scaling limit, we may use the noninteracting case U = 0 in order to establish the region
in momentum space where low-energy degrees of freedom reside. We start by decomposing
the Hamiltonian into free and interacting parts

Hamiltonian (10.18). The ground state of H0 is obtained by ﬁlling all negative energy
modes, i.e. all single-electron states with momenta in the interval [−k F , k F ], where the
Fermi momentum is k F = 2aπ0 . All low-energy modes are found in the vicinity of the two
Fermi points ±k F and these are the degrees of freedom of interest from the point of view of
taking a continuum limit. The above considerations suggest the following decomposition
of the lattice Fermion annihilation operators

The Renormalization Group (RG) equations for the theory (10.26) can be derived directly
from the current algebra (10.27)–(10.29) as is shown in [12]. Under an appropriate choice
of renormalization scheme the RG equations (to all orders in the coupling constant) can be
cast in the form [506] (see also [115, 164, 302])
r

∂λ
2λ2
=−
,
∂r
4π − λ

(10.30)

where r is the RG length scale. The RG equations (10.30) imply that λ diminishes under
renormalization. This means that if we start with λ > 0 as is the case for the spin sector of
(10.24), then the current-current interaction ﬂows to zero. In other words, the interaction
of spin currents in Hs is marginally irrelevant and hence we will ignore it in what follows.
Taking it into account would generate extra logarithms in certain formulas below. On the
other hand, if initially λ < 0 as in the charge sector of (10.24), then the interaction grows
under renormalization: it is marginally relevant.
Let us now show that in the scaling limit the model (10.24) is equivalent to the SU(2)
Thirring model. We deﬁne a metric

In (10.34) we recognize the standard expression for the Hamiltonian of the SU(2) Thirring
model [93,186,327]. We note that the SU(2) Thirring model as well as its U(1) generalization
are Bethe Ansatz solvable [110, 221, 455].

Continuum limit of operators In order to study correlation functions of physical operators,
we need to know what their respective continuum limits are. This is easily done using the
prescription (10.20). Let O j be an operator deﬁned on site j in the lattice model. We denote
its continuum limit by O(x), where x = ja0 .
1. Current Operator: The current operator in the lattice model is given by (1.A.4)

where we have dropped terms that contain higher powers of the lattice spacing a0 . This is
justiﬁed as these terms vanish when we take a0 → 0. We recall that the electric current is
related to J (x) by (1.A.5)
Jel (x) = −ea0 J (x) ,

(10.38)

where −e is the electron charge.
2. Electron density: The electron number operator on site j is

We see that in the continuum limit only the Fourier components with k ≈ 0 and

10.3 Continuum limit

k ≈ 2k F = aπ0 remain. For general band ﬁllings, Fourier components with k ≈ 4k F , k ≈ 6k F
etc. would be present as well [168]. We note that such terms cannot be derived by means
of the simple procedure we have employed here as their coefﬁcients are proportional to the
interaction U . What one needs to do to capture such contributions is to integrate out the highenergy terms in the path-integral representation of the density-density correlation function
n(x) n(0) perturbatively. In this way terms proportional to e.g. cos(4k F x) get generated.
3. Spin operators: The lattice spin operators are deﬁned by (α = x, y, z)

and in the continuum limit have the following decomposition

Like in the expansion of the density operator only Fourier components with k ≈ 0 (‘smooth
magnetization’) and k ≈ 2k F (‘staggered magnetization’) remain.

10.3.1 Bosonization
The SU(2) Thirring model (as well as the theory (10.24)) is equivalent to a theory of
canonical Bose ﬁelds with nonlinear interactions. The bosonic theory may be constructed
by standard ‘Bosonization’ methods [87, 309, 318, 321, 379]. We refer the reader to the
textbooks [139, 168] and reviews [7, 385, 473] for introductions and detailed discussions of
this important subject. In what follows it is often convenient to work in Euclidean space with
imaginary time τ = it. The SU(2) Thirring model is bosonized in terms of two canonical
Bose ﬁelds s (τ, x) and c (τ, x), corresponding to collective spin and charge degrees of
freedom respectively. These Bose ﬁelds have chiral decompositions
a (τ, x) = ϕa (z) + ϕ̄a (z̄) ,

a = s, c ,

(10.43)

where the chiral boson ﬁelds ϕa and ϕ̄a fulﬁl the following commutation relations4
[ϕa (τ, x), ϕ̄b (τ, y)] = 2πiδab ,

a, b = c, s.

(10.44)

The chiral bosons ϕ(z) and ϕ̄(z̄) depend on τ and x only through the combinations
z = vF τ − i x ,

z̄ = v F τ + i x .

(10.45)

It is convenient to deﬁne so-called dual ﬁelds c,s (τ, x) by
a (τ, x) = ϕa (z) − ϕ̄a (z̄) ,
4

a = s, c.

(10.46)

We consider quantization on an inﬁnite line with vanishing boundary conditions at x = ±∞. In a periodic quantization scheme
the chiral Bose ﬁelds commute.

342

Scaling and continuum limits at half-ﬁlling

The canonical Bose ﬁelds and their dual ﬁelds are related by
v F ∂x (τ, x) = −i∂τ (τ, x) ,

∂τ (τ, x) = iv F ∂x (τ, x) .

(10.47)

Here f ↑ = 1 = − f ↓ and ηa are Klein factors5 fulﬁlling the anticommutation relations

(10.49)

The role of the Klein factors is to ensure the appropriate anticommutation relations of the
Fermi ﬁelds. They may be represented by Pauli matrices
η↑ = σ x ,

η↓ = σ y .

(10.50)

In general, the Hilbert space of states should be thought of as containing a ‘Klein’ piece,
in which the Klein factors act. The factors of ei fσ π/4 in (10.48) are introduced in order to
obtain the usual bosonized expressions for the staggered components of the spin operators.
We choose a normalisation of operators such that for |x − y| −→ 0
exp (iα

c (x)) exp (iβ

c (y)) −→ |x − y|

4αβ

exp (iα

c (x) + iβ

c (y)) .

(10.51)

Here we have used a vector notation for the coordinates in Euclidean space x = (v F τ, x).
We note that the normalisation (10.51) is standard in Conformal Field Theory [102] and is
often used in the literature [304, 307, 506]. It implies that the operators exp (iα c (x)) are
dimensionful objects

By virtue of (10.44) we only need to intoduce two Klein factors. In a periodic quantization scheme four Klein factors are
required.

It is important to recall that the theory corresponding to the Hamiltonian (10.53) is not
Lorentz invariant and describes the vicinity of the scaling limit. The scaling limit itself
corresponds to setting vc = vs = v F and dropping the marginally irrelevant interaction in
the spin sector.
Bosonization of operators. Products of the Fermi ﬁelds may be bosonized by using the expressions (10.48) and the normalisation condition (10.51), which governs the short-distance

The general structure of the bosonization identities for a local operator involving lattice
Fermi creation and annihilation operators on several adjacent sites n, . . . ,n + l is

a j C j (τ, x) + (−1)x/a0 b j D j (τ, x),
(10.58)
On,n+1,...,n+l (τ ) −→
j

where C j and D j are (quasi)local operators in the bosonic theory (10.53). In (10.54), (10.55)
and (10.56) we have written the ‘naive’ U -independent results for the amplitudes a j and
b j obtained by bosonizing in the free theory. In the continuum limit, the amplitudes a j
and b j generally depend on the interaction strength U as we have mentioned before. The
reason is that the continuum theory should be thought of as the result of tracing out highenergy degrees of freedom in the Hubbard model. In a path-integral formulation one would
decompose the Fermi operators into high- and low-energy pieces and then integrate out

344

Scaling and continuum limits at half-ﬁlling

the high-energy pieces. Such a procedure produces (10.53) as the leading term for the
Hamiltonian at small U/t. However, there are additional contributions of higher order in
U/t. The same holds true on the level of correlation functions.

10.4 Correlation functions in the scaling limit
Let us now turn to the calculation of the large-distance asymptotics of correlation functions
in the scaling limit. An important simpliﬁcation arises due to spin charge separation.
10.4.1 Spin-charge factorization of correlation functions
The bosonized expression for the two pieces (10.53) of the Hamiltonian commute with one
another. Hs and Hc correspond to collective spin and charge degrees of freedom respectively.
This means that we can choose an eigenbasis of the Hamitonian in which this spin-charge
separation is manifest and eigenstates are represented as products
|eigenstate = |spin ⊗ |charge .

(10.59)

In particular, the ground state can be represented as
|0 = |0 s ⊗ |0 c ,

(10.60)

where |0 s,c are the ground states of the spin and charge Hamiltonians (10.24), (10.53). Similarly, physical observables like spin (10.56), current (10.54) and electron density (10.55)
are expressed as (sums over) products of commuting operators acting in the spin and charge
sectors respectively. Let us consider a physical operator O and represent this factorization by
O(τ, x) = Os (τ, x) ⊗ Oc (τ, x) .

(10.61)

It now follows, that correlation functions can be represented as products over correlation
functions in the spin and charge sectors respectively
0|O(τ, x) Ō(0, 0)|0 = s 0|Os (τ, x) Ōs (0, 0)|0 s
× c 0|Oc (τ, x) Ōc (0, 0)|0 c .

(10.62)

The representation (10.62) is very useful, because the Hamiltonians (10.53) describing the
spin and charge sectors respectively are both exactly solvable. Furthermore, the spin sector is
a simple Gaussian model and correlation functions are easily evaluated (see Appendix 10.C).
This leaves us with the task of determining correlation functions of local operators in the
gapped charge sector. The latter is integrable and as a result the elementary excitations have
the property of factorizable scattering. In massive quantum ﬁeld theories with factorizable
scattering it is possible to determine two-point correlation functions of local operators by a
method known as ‘Form Factor Bootstrap Approach’ (FFBA). The method was conceived
in the late seventies by M. Karowski and P. Weisz [53, 238]. It was developed further in
a series of seminal papers by F. Smirnov and coworkers [248–250, 374, 414, 415, 417–
419]. Detailed accounts of the method are given in F. Smirnov’s book [420] and in papers

10.4 Correlation functions in the scaling limit

345

[32–34,37,72,148,262,289,303,500]. Here we summarize the essential steps and refer the
reader to the aforementioned references for further explanations. The basic idea underlying
the FFBA is to express two-point functions in a spectral (Lehmann) representation in terms
of the elementary excitations with factorizable scattering. The matrix elements (or form
factors) of a given local operator between the ground state and an excited state can then be
inferred from the knowledge of the exact S-matrix.

10.4.2 Spectral representation of two-point functions in the charge sector
A basis of scattering states of the elementary holon and antiholon excitations may be
constructed by means of the Faddeev-Zamolodchikov (FZ) algebra. We deﬁne rapidity
dependent creation and annihilation operators subject to the following algebra, which may
be thought of as ‘generalized commutation relations’

Our notations are such that e.g. the operator Z h (θ ) creates a holon with rapidity θ .6 Using the
ZF operators a Fock space of states can be constructed as follows. The vacuum is deﬁned by

(10.66)

the vacuum

The existence of the FZ operators is a postulate in the FFBA approach. They are not strictly necessary but greatly simplify the
notations in what follows. For zero electron density an explicit representation of the FZ operators is derived in Chapter 15.

(10.70)

Ō(τ, x) = e H τ O† (0) e−H τ ,

10.4.3 Form factors
In the FFBA the form factors are determined from a set of axiomatized assumptions. For the
case of the SU(2) Thirring model they have been formulated by A.N. Kirillov and F. Smirnov
in Refs. [248,249] and by S. Lukyanov in [303]. The basic assumption is that the form factor
f O (θ1 , . . . , θn )ε1 ,... ,εn is a meromorphic function of θn in the strip 0 ≤ Im(θn ) ≤ 2π , whose
only singularities are simple poles. In addition the form factors are subject to the following
conditions [420]:
1. The form factors have the ‘Symmetry Property’
f O (. . . , θ j , θ j+1 , . . . )... ,ε j ,ε j+1 ,... = f O (. . . , θ j+1 , θ j , . . . )... ,εj+1 ,εj ,...
ε

ε

j+1 j
× Sε j+1
ε j (θ j+1 − θ j ).

(10.74)

The symmetry property is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition of the form factor and
is easily established by use of the FZ algebra.
2. The form factors fulﬁl ‘Smirnov’s Axiom’, which for charge neutral operators reads
f O (θ1 , . . . , θn + 2πi)ε1 ,... ,εn = i n exp(2πiω[O, ]) f O (θn , θ1 , . . . , θn−1 )εn ,ε1 ,... ,εn−1 .
(10.75)
Here ω[O, ] is the ‘Locality Index’ [303, 420, 500] of the operator O with respect to

10.4 Correlation functions in the scaling limit

347

the ‘elementary’ ﬁeld , which is any ﬁeld with nonzero matrix elements between the
vacuum and one-particle states. The locality index between two operators A and B is
calculated by considering the operator product A(x)B(y), where x = (vτ, x). Denoting
by AC the analytical continuation in x along a counterclockwise contour C around the
point y, the quantity ω[A, B] is deﬁned as
AC [A(x)B(y)] = exp(2πiω[A, B])A(x)B(y) .

(10.76)

3. The form factors have simple poles at the points θn = θ j + iπ . The residues at these poles
are subject to the ‘Annihilation Pole Condition’. For charge-neutral operators O it reads

iRes θn =θn−1 +iπ f O (θ1 , . . . , θn )ε1 ,... ,εn = f O (θ1 , . . . , θn−2 )ε1 ,... ,εn−2

(10.77)

Here C = iσ y is the charge conjugation matrix. The annihilation pole condition relates
form factors with different numbers of particles.
4. The form factors behave under Lorentz transformations as
f O (θ1 + u, . . . , θn + u)ε1 ,...εn = exp(su) f O (θ1 , . . . , θn )ε1 ,...εn ,

(10.78)

where s is the Lorentz spin of the operator O.
We note that the form factor axioms for the SU(2) Thirring model are of a slightly different
form compared to e.g. the sine-Gordon model. As explained in [420], the reason for this is
that the elementary excitations in the SU(2) Thirring model have Lorentz spin- 14 and hence
possess unusual (fractional) statistics.
10.4.4 Optical conductivity

(10.79)

It is obvious from the bosonized expression (10.54) that the current operator couples only
to the charge degrees of freedom. This implies that spinons do not contribute to the optical
conductivity in the scaling limit. When expressing (10.79) in a spectral representation, we
only have to consider scattering states of holons and antiholons. Furthermore, the current
operator is neutral, which implies that only intermediate states with equal numbers of
holons and antiholons will contribute to the current-current correlation function. Taking
these considerations into account, we arrive at the following spectral representation for the

As a direct consequence of the delta-functions in (10.80) an intermediate state with
n holons and n antiholons will contribute to the real part of σ (ω) only above a frequency of 2n M. Hence σh h̄ (ω) gives the full optical conductivity in the frequency interval
[0, 4M]. The four-particle contribution σhh h̄ h̄ (ω) has been analyzed in Ref. [90], where it
was shown that it is negligible at low frequencies and becomes comparable to the twoparticle contribution σh h̄ (ω) only around ω ≈ 100M. This suggests that the form factor
expansion converges rather quickly at low energies and this has indeed been observed in
many cases, see e.g. Refs. [37, 72, 97, 289], and can be understood in terms of phase-space
arguments [72, 338].
In order to determine σh h̄ (ω) we need the form factor of the current operator between
the vacuum and a holon-antiholon intermediate state. The latter can be found for example
in [32, 238, 304, 420], but it is instructive to work it out directly from the Axioms above.
This is done in Appendix 10.B. The result is

Fig. 10.1. Holon-antiholon contribution to the optical conductivity.

The result (10.83) was ﬁrst obtained in [224]. In ﬁgure 10.1 we plot σh h̄ (ω) as a function
of frequency. We see that σh h̄ (ω) vanishes below the optical gap 2M, then increases as
√
ω − 2M, peaks around ω ≈ 2.5M and then decays at large frequencies. As the full real
part of the optical conductivity Re σ (ω) is equal to σh h̄ (ω) in the frequency interval [0, 4M]
(10.83) gives the exact threshold behaviour of σ (ω).
The square-root increase of Re σ (ω) above the optical gap should be contrasted to the
results for a Peierls insulator7 (noninteracting tight-binding electrons with alternating hopping), where there is a square root singularity [159]

The behaviour of Re σ (ω) in the ‘perturbative’ regime ω  M can be analyzed by RG

10.4.5 Single particle Green’s function
In order to determine the single particle Green’s function it is convenient to work with
Euclidean (imaginary) time τ = it. In the ﬁeld theory limit the imaginary time Green’s
function is expanded as
†

0|cn+1,σ (τ ) c1,σ (0)|0 ≈ a0 0|Rσ (τ, x) Rσ† (0, 0)|0 exp(ik F x)
+ a0 0|L σ (τ, x) L †σ (0, 0)|0 exp(−ik F x) .

(10.86)

Cross-terms such as L σ (τ, x) Rσ† (0, 0) vanish because of the chiral symmetry of the
Gaussian model describing the spin sector.8 Let us now turn to the single particle Green’s

Rigorous results for the Peierls instability were obtained in [295, 297].
In other words, the spin pieces of such correlation functions vanish because eiαϕ(z) eiβ ϕ̄(z̄) = 0 in the Gaussian model.

We note that the knowledge of the normalization Z 0 is very useful for comparisons with
numerical computations of e.g. the momentum distributions function or the tunneling density of states. The leading term on the r.h.s. of equation (10.89) is the contribution of a
one antiholon intermediate state. The θ -dependence of the form factor of Oc = exp(iϕc /2)
between the vacuum and 1-antiholon states is ﬁxed by the Lorentz spin s = 1/4 of Oc .
There are subleading contributions due to intermediate states with two antiholons and one
holon, three antiholons and two holons and so on. It has been shown in [105] that their
contribution is negligible at large distances. Carrying out the θ -integration we obtain

The result (10.91) was ﬁrst written down by P. B. Wiegmann in [480] and independently
conjectured by J. Voit in [474]. We note that the expression (10.91) looks quite natural,
as it reconciles the known behaviour at short distances v F r → 0, (v F τ − i x)−1 , with the
presence of a spectral gap M leading to the exponential decay at large distances v F r → ∞.
However, the fact that such a simple ansatz gives the correct answer is really a coincidence.
In the case of the U(1) Thirring model [307] it would lead to an incorrect result.
It is now straightforward to Fourier transform (10.91) and (10.92) and then analytically
continue to real frequencies. The single particle Green’s function of right-moving fermions

The result (10.96) is valid at low energies where |q|  k F We note that the Green’s function
(10.96) has a branch cut but no poles. This is a direct reﬂection of the fact that there are no
coherent single particle excitations with the quantum numbers of an electron. We also note
that in the approximation (10.96)
G (R) (0, ±k F ) = 0 ,

(10.97)

i.e. the Green’s function vanishes at the Fermi ‘surface’ ±k F . We expect that (10.97)
continues to hold when the contributions of multiparticle intermediate states are taken into
account and is an exact property of the Green’s function. This has an important consequence
[129]. Luttinger’s Theorem relates the density of electrons Ne /V to the single particle

Green’s function (10.96) fulﬁls (10.98) by virtue of having zeroes at the position of noninteracting Fermi surface, i.e. ±k F . Luttinger’s Theorem (10.98) is interesting, because it
implies that the integral on the right hand side of (10.98) is independent of electron-electron
interactions. In particular this means that the volume of the Fermi surface of a Fermi liquid

We note that as a consequence of the particle-hole symmetry at half ﬁlling we have

(10.100)

The spectral function is of direct experimental interest as it can be measured by angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), see Refs. [71, 91] and references therein.
Taking the imaginary part of (10.96) we arrive at the following simple result for the spectral

part and then taking the real part of the resulting function. The spectral function is completely

incoherent, there are no poles corresponding to the coherent propagation of electrons or
holes. Instead there is a scattering continuum that is singular at the spectral gap.
Let us relate these results to our discussion of the excitation spectrum at half ﬁlling in
Section 7.2. For positive frequencies the relevant excitation is an antiholon-spinon excitation. The latter is obtained by acting with η† on the spin-charge scattering state. The
resulting boundaries of the scattering continuum are obtained by shifting the momentum
ﬁgure 7.11 by π. In the scaling limit there is an exponentially small gap at momenta ± π2
and in the vicinity of these points the spectral function is given by (10.101). For negative
frequencies we need to consider a holon-spinon excited state i.e. the spin-charge scattering
state of Section 7.2.

(10.103)

Here the smooth n 0 and staggered n 2k F components of the electron density have been deﬁned
in (10.40). We note that there are no ‘mixed terms’ as is most easily seen in the bosonic
representation (10.55). As the spin sector is gapless we have

Small k behaviour. In the vicinity of k = 0 the dynamical density response is dominated by

analogy to our calculation of the optical conductivity. Employing a spectral representation
in terms of scattering states of holons and antiholons we obtain

where η is a positive inﬁnitesimal. As n 0 is charge neutral, the leading contribution at small
energies is due to intermediate states with one holon and one antiholon. More precisely, the
relevant intermediate state is the η z = 0 state of the charge-triplet excitation constructed in
Section 7.2, see ﬁgure 7.9. The corresponding form factors can be determined along the
same lines as the two-particle form factor of the current operator (see Appendix 10.B), the
only difference coming from the transformation properties under Lorentz transformations.

which implies that ω2 > v 2F q 2 + 4M 2 . In order to extract the behaviour just above the

The remaining θ -integral in (10.127) is therefore over a very small interval and can be taken

The important result is that L(ω, 2k F + q) vanishes as the threshold is approached from
above. There are no threshold singularities! Instead L(ω, 2k F + q) vanishes in a power-law
fashion. The same holds true in presence of a magnetic ﬁeld as has been shown in [89].

It is convenient to plot L(ω, 2k F + q) as a function of s, which is done in ﬁgure 10.3. At ﬁrst
sight it looks quite strange that L(ω, q) does not go to zero at large ω and ﬁxed q. However,
we recall that the ﬁeld theory calculations cease to be applicable at energies comparable to
the bandwidth 4t. In order to understand why L(ω, q) increases with frequency it is useful
to determine the density-density correlations in the tight-binding model of noninteracting
electrons (U = 0). A simple calculation gives

A density plot of L u=0 (ω, k) is shown in ﬁgure 10.4. Most of the spectral weight is located
at high energies and L u=0 (ω, k) increases with frequency. At ﬁnite interaction strength u the
low-energy behaviour is changed by the dynamical generation of the Mott gap. However, a
small value of u will not alter the overall distribution of spectral weight. Hence one would
expect that L(ω, q) (eventually) will increase with frequency, in accordance with the ﬁeld
theory result.

The leading corrections to (10.147) are proportional to e−2Mr and can be evaluated by
the same method we used to obtain the large-distance asymptotics of the density-density
correlation functions. In the dynamical structure factor these corrections contribute only for
energies higher than 2M, i.e. twice the single particle gap.

10.5 Correlation functions in the continuum limit
As we have mentioned before, the continuum limit describes the vicinity of the scaling limit
of the half ﬁlled Hubbard model. This is a very important regime. If one is interested in
physical properties for weak repulsion, say U ≈ t, one cannot rely on the results obtained in
the scaling limit but one may hope that this regime is captured by the continuum limit. The
reason is that the window of applicability of the results in the continuum limit is ultimately
determined by the requirement that the ratio of the charge gap  (7.18) to the electronic
bandwidth 4t is small, i.e.
  4t.

(10.148)

For U = t we have  ≈ 0.002 512 35t and this criterion is satisﬁed. As we have mentioned
before, the Hamiltonian in the continuum limit (10.24) is the sum of two integrable quantum
ﬁeld theories and correlation functions can be obtained in a way analogous to the scaling
limit. The main differences between scaling and continuum limits are

362

Scaling and continuum limits at half-ﬁlling

r spin and charge velocities are different in the continuum limit but are the same in the

scaling limit;

r the charge gap is given by (7.18) in the continuum limit and by (10.1) in the scaling limit;
r the spin Hamiltonian (10.24) in the continuum limit contains a marginally irrelevant

current-current interaction;

r the amplitudes of the bosonized expressions of local operators depend on the interaction

U in the continuum limit and are not generally known.
The most important difference is that vc = vs in the continuum limit. In what follows we
will ignore the marginally irrelevant current-current interaction in the spin sector. Taking
it into account leads to logarithmic corrections, which are generally small. We also will
neglect the U -dependence of the amplitudes of the bosonized expressions for local operators.
Furthermore, we will use the exact result (7.18) for the charge gap rather than (10.1), which
holds only in the scaling limit.
10.5.1 Optical conductivity
In the scaling limit the current operator does not involve the spin degrees of freedom and this
continues to hold true in the continuum limit. Hence we may proceed as in the scaling limit
and employ a spectral representation in terms of scattering states of holons and antiholons.
The main difference between the scaling limit and the continuum limit are the replacements
of the Fermi velocity by the charge velocity and of the charge gap M by  as mentioned
above. Retaining the bosonized expression obtained in the scaling limit
J (τ, x) =

i
∂τ

c ,

(10.149)

and then going through the same steps as in the calculation for the scaling limit, we obtain

The numerical method used in Ref. [224] is the Dynamical Density Matrix Renormalization
Group (DDMRG), see [223, 271] and references therein. The method allows for the calculation of Re σ (ω) on large lattices of 128 sites, provided a broadening of the energy levels of
intermediate states is introduced. The numerical results for U = 3t presented in [224] are in
excellent agreement with (10.150) despite the fact that at U = 3t the charge gap is already
sizeable (U = 3t) = 0.315 687t. The velocity ratio entering (10.150) is obtained

In ﬁgure 10.5 we show a comparison between equation (10.150) and DDMRG results
for the Hubbard model with U = 3t, for which the aforementioned broadening has been
removed by means of a numerical deconvolution [222]. The agreement is quite satisfactory.
We note that the corrections to (10.150) due to intermediate states with more than one
holon and one antiholon are extremely small in the relevant range of frequencies.

10.5.2 Single particle Green’s function
The single particle Green’s functions of left- and right-moving fermions in Euclidean space
in the continuum limit are obtained by introducing spin and charge velocities in the expressions (10.88) and (10.89) for the spin and charge pieces and replacing the expression M for
the charge gap by . This gives

and are thus of order O(exp(−3r )). After Fourier transformation and analytic continuation

Here the charge gap  and the spin and charge velocities are given by (7.18), (7.21) and
(7.26) respectively. The spectral function is obtained from the imaginary part of G (R) by
(10.99) and we refrain from writing down its rather lengthy explicit expression. In order to
interpret the spectral function, it is useful to determine its threshold. The intermediate state
with lowest possible energy that couples to the fermion annihilation operator in the vicinity
of k F is a scattering state of one antiholon and one spinon. The energy and dispersion of
such states in general are
,
P = a0−1 Ps () + Ph̄ (k) ,
,
E = t Es () + Eh̄ (k) ,
(10.155)
where Ps,h̄ and Es,h̄ are given by (7.8) and where we have reinstituted the lattice spacing a0

the spin and charge sectors separately,9 so that

E = vs ps + 2 + vc2 pc2 ,

(10.156)

where the spinon momentum is positive, because Ps () ∈ [0, π ] and the low-energy modes
occur for Ph̄ ≈ π2 . In other words we are dealing with a right-moving spinon. The threshold (for positive frequencies ω > 0) is obtained by minimizing the energy at ﬁxed total

Inspection of (10.157) shows that the threshold is not symmetric around k F . For momenta
smaller than k F + Q the threshold is equal to the antiholon dispersion. Furthermore, at the
threshold the entire momentum is carried by the antiholon whereas the spinon momentum
is zero. On the other hand, for momenta larger than k F + Q, the ‘excess’ momentum
P − k F − Q is carried by the spin degrees of freedom.

We recall that as vs = vc the full theory is not Lorentz invariant.

function slightly complex and then taking the imaginary part.

The spectral function corresponding to U = t is shown in a series of constant-q scans in
ﬁgure 10.6. The most important difference between the spectral functions in the continuum
and scaling limits is readily seen by comparing ﬁgures 10.6 and 10.2. In the continuum limit
and at ω > 0, the single peak above the threshold splits into two peaks if q is larger than a
critical value Q. This splitting is a direct manifestation of spin-charge separation. The ﬁrst
peak occurs at the threshold and follows the spinon dispersion,
whereas the higher energy
3

peak disperses like an antiholon, i.e. occurs at ω =  + vc q 2 . A peak splitting of this
type is known to exist from numerical computations of the spectral function for the half
ﬁlled Hubbard model [38,136,365,390]. Several experiments have reported observations of
related features in the ARPES spectra of the quasi one-dimensional charge transfer insulators
SrCuO2 and Sr2 CuO3 [150, 245].

The factor of two comes from the fact that both left- and right-movers contribute. The

frequencies above .

10.5.4 Momentum distribution function
From the time-independent single particle Green’s function we can calculate the momentum
distribution function in the vicinity of k F . Particle-hole symmetry implies that n σ (k F +
q) = 1 − n σ (k F − q), which ﬁxes n(k F ) = 12 . Assuming that momentum dependence in
the vicinity of k F is mainly due to the leading term (10.152) in the expansion of the Green’s
function we arrive at the following approximate result [128]

The momentum distribution function in the half-ﬁlled Hubbard model has been determined

u the numerical results are in agreement with (10.161).

10.5.5 Density-density response function
Last but not least, let us consider the density-density response function L(ω, k) deﬁned
in (10.106). The generalization of the result (10.111) for small q ≈ 0 to the case vc = vs
works in the same way as for the optical conductivity and we will not dwell on it. The
determination of the response function in the continuum limit for q ≈ 2k F is somewhat
more complicated. The threshold of L(ω > 0, k ≈ 2k F ) can be determined by considering
the lowest intermediate state that couples to the density operator at k = 2k F , which is a
scattering state of one holon, one antiholon and two spinons. The energy and dispersion of
such states in general are
,
P = a0−1 Ps (1 ) + Ps (2 ) + Ph̄ (k1 ) + Ph (k2 ) ,
,
E = t Es (1 ) + Es (2 ) + Eh̄ (k1 ) + Eh (k2 ) ,
(10.162)
where Ps,h̄ and Es,h̄ are given by (7.8). In the continuum limit we only consider low-energy
states, which occur at momenta close to 2k F = aπ0 . We choose a parametrization such
that
Ps (1 ) = p1 a0 ≥ 0 ,

at the threshold and is free of singularities. As a matter of fact there are no signiﬁcant
differences between the continuum limit and the scaling limit. The fact that no pronounced
features associated with vs and vc appear in L(ω, 2k F + q) may be understood intuitively
by recalling that the relevant excitations involve at least four particles (two spinons and one
holon/antiholon each). Fixing the total energy and momentum of the state still leaves us
with two free momenta over which we need to average.

10.6 Finite temperatures
A natural question is whether the calculations of dynamical correlation functions in the
scaling and continuum limits can be extended to ﬁnite temperatures. Proposals on how

368

Scaling and continuum limits at half-ﬁlling

to calculate one and two point functions for integrable Quantum Field Theories at ﬁnite
temperatures exist [284,285,306,375], but the problem is quite difﬁcult in general. In [261]
a method was proposed that allows for the calculation of two point functions in massive
integrable quantum ﬁeld theories at temperatures (much) smaller than the spectral gap. This
approach was used in [129] to determine the single particle spectral function of the half
ﬁlled Hubbard model in the continuum limit at low temperatures. The main ﬁnding of [129]
is that even a small temperature leads to a signiﬁcant smearing out of the (anti)holon peak
in the spectral function. This is easily understood: as the spin sector remains gapless in
the half ﬁlled Hubbard model a temperature that is small compared to the charge gap may
still signiﬁcantly alter the dynamical response of the spin degrees of freedom. On the other
hand, the tunneling density of states for frequencies below the charge gap is exponentially
small at low temperatures.

Appendices to Chapter 10

10.A Current algebra
In this appendix we summarize some properties of the SU(2) spin and pseudospin currents (10.22). Our discussion closely follows Afﬂeck’s work [5]. Let us consider spinless
fermions with Hamiltonian density (to ease notations we set the velocity equal to 1 in what
follows)
,
H = i : L † ∂x L − R † ∂x R : .
(10.A.1)
The corresponding Lagrangian density is
L = i : L † [∂t − ∂x ] L : +i : R † [∂t + ∂x ] R : .

(10.A.2)

Introducing light-cone coordinates
x± = t ± x ,
we may rewrite L as

∂± =

(∂t ± ∂x )

(10.A.3)

,
L = 2i : L †σ ∂− L σ + Rσ† ∂+ Rσ : .

(10.A.4)

The Euler-Lagrange equations are
∂− L = 0 = ∂+ R .

(10.A.5)

From now on we concentrate on the right-moving fermions. The corresponding formulas for left-movers are obtained in the same way. The fermion anticommutation relations
read
{R † (x− ), R(y− )} = δ(x− − y− ) .

(10.A.6)

We note that (10.A.6) holds not only for equal times, but for general x− , y− because R
depends on t and x only through x− by virtue of the Euler-Lagrange equations. The fermion
propagator is given by
R(x− ) R † (y− ) =

Let us now introduce a current
J (x− ) = lim : R † (x− − ε) R(x− + ε) : ,
ε→0

(10.A.8)

where ‘:’ denotes normal ordering. The commutator of two currents can now be evaluated
by using (10.A.6). It is sufﬁcient to point-split one of the currents, so that
[J (x− ), J (y− )] = lim [J (x− ), : R † (y− − ε)R(y− + ε) :]
ε→0

= lim [δ(x− − y− + ε) − δ(x− − y− − ε)] R † (y− − ε)R(y− + ε)

4π ε
and that the normal ordered piece does not have a singularity for ε → 0. The derivative
of a delta-function generated by the commutator of currents is known as a ‘Schwinger
term’ [387].
Let us now consider the operator product of two currents
J (x− − ε) J (x− + ε) = lim : R † (x− − ε − δ)R(x− − ε + δ) :
δ→0

× : R † (x− + ε − δ)R(x− + ε + δ) : .

(10.A.11)

Removing the normal orderings by (10.A.10) and then normal ordering the resulting term
quartic in Fermi operators leads to
J (x− − ε) J (x− + ε) = : R † (x− − ε)R(x− − ε)R † (x− + ε)R(x− + ε) :

In this appendix we discuss how to determine two-particle form factors using the Axioms

(10.B.1)

Here we have used that the current operator has mutual locality index zero, which is most
easily established in the bosonic representation. The current operator is odd under charge
conjugation, which implies that it couples only to the triplet state. This is because the charge
conjugation matrix C = iσ y is antisymmetric.1 The Riemann-Hilbert Problem (10.B.1) can
be ‘scalarized’ by working in a basis in which the S-matrix is diagonal. Symmetrizing in
the indices ε1 and ε2 we obtain

Last but not least we need to know correlation functions of so-called chiral vertex operators.
Let us deﬁne complex coordinates z and z̄ by

z̄ = vτ + i x ,

∂τ = v(∂z + ∂z̄ ) ,

∂x = −i(∂z − ∂z̄ ) .

Next we deﬁne chiral Bose ﬁelds by
(τ, x) = ϕ(z) + ϕ̄(z̄) ,
The chiral ﬁelds have propagators
Tτ ϕ(z) ϕ(0) = −2 ln [z] ,
Tτ ϕ̄(z̄) ϕ̄(0)) = −2 ln [z̄] .

(10.C.25)

Correlation functions of chiral vertex operators are then given by
Tτ eiαϕ(z) e−iαϕ(0) = z −2α ,

Tτ eiαϕ̄(z̄) e−iαϕ̄(0) = z̄ −2α .

which is a general property of free bosonic ﬁeld theories.

Universal correlations at low density

In Chapter 9 we developed the picture of the asymptotics of the correlation functions of
the Hubbard model for the phases with gapless excitations, i.e., for the phases with ground
states belonging to regions II and IV of the ground state phase diagram discussed in Chapter
6.3 (see ﬁgures 6.4, 6.5). Our results relied on the predictions of conformal ﬁeld theory
which are expected to hold for a whole universality class of models related to the Hubbard
model and which only need the ﬁnite size data calculated in Chapter 8 as input parameters.
Correlation functions at half-ﬁlling (phase V) were considered in the previous chapter on
the basis of a special continuum limit and the predictions of certain integrable quantum ﬁeld
theories.
Here we shall consider correlation functions in the phase whose ground state is the empty
band (phase I in the ground state phase diagram, ﬁgures 6.4, 6.5). At zero temperature the
boundary of this phase in the µ-B plane (see ﬁgure 6.5) is determined by equation (6.20):
µ < µ0 (B). For small ﬁnite temperature a small number of particles is populating the
system. They form a dilute, thermodynamically ideal gas with pressure proportional to the
temperature (see below). We shall say the system is in the gas phase [176] and shall give a
more precise meaning to this statement later.
At zero temperature it costs the energy µ0 (B) − µ > 0 (see equation (6.20)) to add
a single electron to the phase. Thus, the lowest lying possible excitation has a gap, and
conformal ﬁeld theory cannot be applied. We shall see below that instead the non-relativistic
Fermi gas with inﬁnite point-like repulsion becomes the universal model for the longwavelength, low-temperature physics of one-dimensional electrons. This model, which we
call the impenetrable electron gas, allows for a rigorous mathematical treatment by means
of the Bethe ansatz. In particular, a so-called determinant representation [270] for the twopoint Green function could be derived [217,218]. This determinant representation is related
to an integrable classical evolution equation and to a Riemann-Hilbert problem, that enable
the exact calculation of the asymptotics of the two-point Green functions [173, 174].
In Section 11.1 we shall explain our ideas about the universality of the long-wavelength,
low-temperature asymptotics of electronic correlations in the gas phase [171,176]. We shall
start with the paradigmatic Hubbard model, and then argue that certain modiﬁcations of the
interaction do not change the long-wavelength, low-temperature physics of the model. In
the appropriate scaling limit all modiﬁed Hamiltonians lead to the same effective model: the
376

11.1 The Hubbard model in the gas phase

impenetrable electron gas model. A summary of the calculation [173,174] of the asymptotics
of the two-point Green functions of this model is presented in Section 11.2.
11.1 The Hubbard model in the gas phase
11.1.1 The gas phase
For simplicity let us neglect the magnetic ﬁeld in this section. The density D of noninteracting, one-dimensional spin- 12 Fermions on a lattice is given by the integral over the
Fermi weight,

(11.1)

π 0
e
+1
Here ε( p) is the dispersion of the Fermions, T denotes the temperature and µ the chemical
potential. Let us assume ε( p) to be monotonically increasing and bounded from below.
If the chemical potential is smaller than a critical value, µ < µc = min p>0 ε( p), then D
vanishes in the zero temperature limit T → 0+. For µ > µc , on the other hand, the density
D approaches a ﬁnite positive value as T → 0+. This means that the system undergoes a
phase transition at T = 0 as a function of the chemical potential. The critical point is at
µ = µc . Assuming that ε( p) = µc + p 2 + O( p 4 ), we obtain
2√
D=
µ − µc
(11.2)
π
for µc < µ < µc + δ, δ  1. Clearly, the phase transition is a transition from a band insulator for µ < µc to a conductor for µ > µc .
Let us come back to the Hubbard model as an example for an interacting electron system.
In Chapter 6 we found for the transition from phase I to phase IV (see equation (6.41) and
ﬁgure 6.7)
13
D = nc =
µ − µ0 (0)
(11.3)
π
for µ close to but larger than µ0 (0). Thus, the qualitative picture is the same for free and for
interacting electrons. There is a phase transition from a zero density phase to a phase with
a ﬁnite density of particles which in the interacting case may be interpreted as a transition
from a correlated insulator to a correlated metal.1
Let us complete our picture by considering small positive temperatures. For ﬁxed chemical potential we expect a small number of thermally excited particles in phase I forming
a dilute gas whose properties can be studied by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz
equations (see Chapter 5). For this purpose it is convenient to express the Gibbs free energy
f = −P (P pressure), equation (5.57), in terms of the dressed energies κ(k), εn (), εn (),
equations (5.68), of elementary excitations at ﬁnite temperature. κ(k) is the dressed energy
1

Comparing (11.2) and (11.3), however, we see that the results for the electron density close to the critical point µ = µ0 (0) differ
by a factor of two. This difference may be interpreted as a ground state signature of the spin-charge separation discussed in
Chapter 7: The elementary charge excitations of the Hubbard model at ﬁnite positive u are spinless due to the interaction, hence
the density is smaller by a factor of two.

The gas phase is characterized by the absence of a Fermi surface for κ(k). Thus, κ(k) is
positive in the zero temperature limit, and the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (11.6)
becomes exponentially small in T . Dropping this term, the equations (11.6) decouple from
(11.5). Since the equations become independent of , it is not hard to solve them. The

(see e.g. [432]). Inserting this solution into (11.5) we obtain
κ(k) = −µ − 2u − 2 cos k − T ln 2 .

(11.11)

Our initial assumption, that limT →0 κ(k) > 0 self-consistently holds for all k if µ + 2u +
2 < 0, which is precisely the same as the condition µ < µ0 (0) for being in the gas phase
stated above. With (11.11) the low temperature expression for the pressure becomes

and we see that the density D = ∂ P/∂µ and the pressure P are related by the ideal gas law,
P = TD.

(11.13)

There are two more important lessons to learn from our simple calculation. First, the
low temperature limit in the gas phase works the same way as the strong coupling limit
at ﬁnite temperatures. Second, the low temperature Gibbs free energy f = −P in the gas
phase shows no signature of the discreteness of the lattice. It is the same as for the impenetrable electron gas (see below), which is a continuum model. This agrees well with our
intuitive understanding of the gas phase at low temperature: (i) the mean free path (= 1/D)
of the electrons is large compared to the lattice spacing (which we set equal to unity so far);
(ii) their kinetic energy is of the order T . Hence, the effective repulsion is large for T  u;
(iii) the ideal gas law holds at low temperature.

11.1.2 Scaling
The above arguments show that only electrons with small momenta, corresponding to long
wavelengths, contribute to the low-temperature properties of the Hubbard model in the gas
phase. Thus, the Hubbard model in the gas phase at low temperature is effectively described
by its continuum limit (see appendix 2.B). Recall that in order to perform the continuum
limit we have to introduce the lattice spacing a0 and coordinates x = a0 n connected with
the nth lattice site. The total length of the system is  = a0 L. The continuum limit is the
limit a0 → 0 for ﬁxed . In this limit we obtain canonical ﬁeld operators σ (x) for electrons
of spin σ as
√
σ (x) = lim cn,σ / a0 .
(11.14)
a0 →0

Let us perform the rescaling
TH = a02 T , µ H + 2u + 2 = a02 µ , k H = a0 k , t H = t/a02 , B H = a02 B ,

(11.15)

where k denotes the momentum, t the time and B the magnetic ﬁeld, which we shall
incorporate below. The index ‘H ’ refers to the Hubbard model. Then, in the limit a0 → 0,
we ﬁnd
H H /TH = H/T .

Note that the coupling c1 = u/a0 of the continuum model goes to inﬁnity! This is a peculiarity of the one-dimensional system. The effective interaction in the low-density phase

380

Universal correlations at low density

becomes large. Similar scaling arguments lead to an effective coupling c2 = u in two dimensions and to c3 = a0 u in three dimensions, i.e., unlike one-dimensional electrons threedimensional electrons in the gas phase are free.

11.1.3 Universality
What happens to more general Hamiltonians in the continuum limit? Let us consider Hamiltonians of the form HG = H H + V , where H H is the Hubbard Hamiltonian and V contains
additional short-range interactions. We shall assume that V is a sum of local terms V j which
preserve the particle number. Then V j contains as many creation as annihilation operators,
and the number of ﬁeld operators in V j is even. We shall further assume that V j is Hermitian
and space parity invariant.
1/2
According to equation (11.14) every ﬁeld c j,σ on the lattice contributes a factor of a0
in the continuum limit. One factor of a0 is absorbed by the volume element d x = a0 , when
turning from summation to integration. Thus, if V j contains 8 or more ﬁeld operators, then
V ∼ a03 and V /TH vanishes. If V j contains 6 ﬁeld operators, then at least two of the creation
operators and two of the annihilation operators must belong to different lattice sites, since
otherwise V j = 0. A typical term is, for instance, V j = c+j,↑ c+j,↓ c+j+1,↑ c j+1,↑ c j,↓ c j,↑ . In the
1/2

3/2

5/2

continuum limit we have c j+1,↑ = a0 ↑ (x) + a0 ∂x ↑ (x) + O(a0 ). Hence, the leading
term vanishes due to the Pauli principle. The next to leading term acquires an additional
power of a0 . We conclude that V ∼ a03 and thus V /TH → 0.
If V j contains 4 ﬁelds, then
V ∼ a02 ↑+ (x)↓+ (x)↓ (x)↑ (x) + O(a04 ) .

(11.18)

Here the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the density-density interaction of the electron
gas. In order to arrive at the impenetrable electron gas model the coefﬁcient in front of this
term has to be positive. Note that there are no terms of the order of a03 on the right hand side
of (11.18) and thus no other terms than the ﬁrst one in the continuum limit. Terms of the
order of a03 would contain precisely one spatial derivative. They are ruled out, since they
would break space parity.
Considering the case, when V j contains 2 ﬁelds, we ﬁnd, except for the kinetic energy and
the chemical potential term, terms which correspond to a coupling to an external magnetic
ﬁeld B H . For these terms to be ﬁnite in the continuum limit we have to rescale the magnetic
ﬁeld as B H = a02 B (see equation (11.15)).
Our considerations show that the impenetrable electron gas model with magnetic ﬁeld,

11.1.4 Asymptotics of correlation functions in the gas phase
The impenetrable electron gas is the inﬁnite coupling limit of the electron gas with repulsive
delta interaction (a0 → 0 in (11.19)), which was the ﬁrst model solved by nested Bethe
ansatz [154,493]. The pressure of the system as a function of T , µ and B is known explicitly

and may serve as thermodynamic potential. The expression (11.20) is formally the same as
for a gas of free spinless Fermions with effective (temperature dependent) chemical potential µe f f = µ + T ln(2 cosh B/T ). Hence the Fermi surface vanishes for limT →0 µe f f =
µ + |B| < 0. The ﬁnite temperature correlation functions of the impenetrable electron gas
depend crucially on the sign of µe f f . This allows us to give precise meaning to the gas phase
at ﬁnite temperature by the condition µe f f < 0, which is also sufﬁcient for deriving the ideal
gas law (11.13) from the low temperature limit of (11.20). Note that for zero magnetic ﬁeld
and small temperature equation (11.20) coincides with the right hand side of (11.12).

For the impenetrable electron gas these correlation functions were represented as determinants of Fredholm integral operators in [217,218]. The determinant representation provides
a powerful tool to study their properties analytically.
In [173,174] the determinant representation was used to derive a nonlinear partial differential equation for two classical auxiliary ﬁelds, which determine the correlation functions.
This partial differential equation is closely related to the Heisenberg equation of the quantum
Hamiltonian (11.17). It is called the separated nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Together
with a corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem it determines the large-time, long-distance
asymptotics of the correlators (11.21a), (11.21b) (for details see the following sections).
In [173, 174] the asymptotics x, t → ∞ was calculated for ﬁxed ratio k0 = x/2t. The crucial parameter for the asymptotics is the average number of particles x D in the interval
[0, x]. If x is large but x D  1 (i.e., T small), an electron propagates freely from 0 to x,
and the correlation functions (11.21a), (11.21b) are those of free Fermions,

For B ≤ 0 there is no distinction between time- and space-like regimes. The asymptotics is
given by (11.25).
It seems fair to mention here that the calculation of the asymptotics (11.23), (11.25) is
rather hard and lengthy. The required technics are presented in detail in parts III and IV
of the book [270]. We can only sketch the calculations in the remaining sections of this
chapter. We wish to emphasize that the terms on the right-hand side of equations (11.23)
and (11.25) are the three leading terms of an asymptotic expansions in t and that the method
employed in [173] allows for a systematic calculation of the next, subleading orders.
The leading exponential factor in (11.23) and (11.25), has a clear physical interpretation:
because of the speciﬁc form of the inﬁnite repulsion in (11.17), up-spin electrons are only
scattered by down-spin electrons. This is reﬂected in the fact that the correlation length
is 1/D↓ . The expression 1/D↓ may be interpreted as the mean free path of the up-spin
electrons. Thus, the correlation length for up-spin electrons is equal to their mean free
path. The exponential decay of the two-point Green functions means that, due to the strong
interaction, an up-spin electron is conﬁned by the cloud of surrounding down-spin electrons.
Thus, we are facing an interesting situation: although at small distances the electrons look
like free Fermions, they are conﬁned on a ‘macroscopic scale’ set by the mean free path
1/D↓ .

11.1.5 Outline of the derivation
The derivation of the above results on the asymptotics of the two-point Green functions at low
temperature is based on the fact that the impenetrable electron gas model is exactly solvable
by Bethe ansatz. The Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions [154, 493] and the thermodynamics of
the model [432] are long since known. But only more recently a determinant representation
for the two-point Green functions was derived by Izergin and Pronko [217, 218]. Their
derivation includes the following steps:
(i) A change of basis for the spin part of the Bethe ansatz wave function from inhomogeneous XXX to XX spin chain eigenfunctions, which is possible at inﬁnite repulsion.
(ii) The calculation of form factors in the ﬁnite volume.
(iii) A summation of the form factors.
(iv) The thermodynamic limit.
The details of the calculation can be found in the article [218].
The asymptotic analysis of the correlation functions was performed in [173, 174]. Then
starting point was the determinant representation of Izergin and Pronko (Section 11.2.1),
which is valid for all x and t. The non-trivial ingredients of the determinant representation
are certain auxiliary functions b++ and B−− and the Fredholm determinant det( Iˆ + V̂ ) of
an integral operator V̂ . A direct yet lengthy calculation shows that b++ and B−− satisfy
the separated non-linear Schrödinger equation (Section 11.2.2), which is a well-known
integrable partial differential equation. The logarithm of the Fredholm determinant plays
the role of its tau-function (Section 11.2.3). Moreover, a Riemann-Hilbert problem that
ﬁxes b++ and B−− as solutions of the separated non-linear Schrödinger equation can be
derived from the determinant representation (Section 11.2.4). The Riemann-Hilbert problem
is the appropriate starting point for the asymptotic analysis of the correlation functions G ±
↑↑
(Section 11.2.5).
Luckily, the differential equation and the Riemann-Hilbert problem turn out to be of the
same form as in case of the impenetrable (spinless) Bose gas [211,270]. Therefore a theorem
obtained in the asymptotic analysis of the impenetrable Bose gas [212] could be applied
to the impenetrable electrons as well. In contrast to the bosonic case, there is, however,
an additional external integration in the determinant representation of the impenetrable
electron gas. This integration can be carried out in the low-temperature limit, by the method
of steepest descent (Section 11.2.6).

11.2 Correlation functions of the impenetrable electron gas
11.2.1 Determinant representation
Let us now recall the determinant representation for the correlation functions G ±
↑↑ (x, t),
which was derived in [217, 218]. We shall basically follow the account of [174].
Yet, it turns out to be useful to rescale the variables and the correlation functions.

removes the explicit temperature dependence from all expressions. Furthermore, it will
allow us to make close contact with results which were obtained for the impenetrable Bose
gas [211,212,270]. The index ‘r ’ in (11.27) stands for ‘rescaled’. For the sake of simplicity
we shall suppress this index in the following sections. We shall come back to physical space
and time variables only in the last section, where we consider the low temperature limit.

It is instructive to compare the determinant representation (11.30) for the correlation
function g + (x, t) with the corresponding expression for impenetrable bosons (see e.g. page
345 of [270]). The main formal differences are the occurrence of the η-integral in (11.30)
and the occurrence of η in the deﬁnition of e+ . As can be seen from the derivation of
(11.30) in [218], the η-integration is related to the spin degrees of freedom. For η = ±π the
expression − 12 e2iβt b++ det( Iˆ + V̂ ) agrees with the ﬁeld-ﬁeld correlator for impenetrable
Bosons (recall, however, the different physical meaning of β).

11.2.2 Differential equations
As in case of impenetrable Bosons [211, 270] it is possible to derive a set of integrable
nonlinear partial differential equations for the potentials b++ and B−− and to express the

11.2.3 Connection between Fredholm determinant and potentials
To describe the correlation functions (11.30) and (11.31) one has to relate the Fredholm
determinant det( Iˆ + V̂ ) and the potentials Bab and Cab . Let us use the abbreviation
σ (x, t, β) = ln det( Iˆ + V̂ ). The logarithmic derivatives of the Fredholm determinant with
respect to x, t and β are
∂x σ = − 2iB+− ,

(11.53)

(11.55)

For the calculation of the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant we further need the
second derivatives of σ with respect to space and time,
∂x2 σ = 4B−− b++ ,

(11.56)

∂x ∂t σ = 2i(B−− ∂x b++ − b++ ∂x B−− ) ,

From now on we will restrict ourselves to the case of negative effective chemical potential,
β < 0. Recall that this is the condition for the system to be in the gas phase. For negative
β the logarithmic derivatives ∂x σ and ∂t σ of the Fredholm determinant and the potentials
b++ and B−− are determined by the following matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem, which was
derived from the determinant representation (see Section 11.2.1) in [174].
(i) φ : C → End(C2 ) is analytic in C \ R.

asymptotics (x, t → ∞ for ﬁxed ratio λ0 = −2x/t) of the functions ∂x σ , ∂t σ , b++ and
B−− [173, 212]. It turns out, in particular, that b++ and B−− are a decaying solution of the
separated nonlinear Schrödinger equation (11.51), (11.52). Now the form of the complete
asymptotic decomposition of the decaying solutions of the separated nonlinear Schrödinger
equation is known [2, 388].

where u 0 , v0 , u nk , vnk and ν are functions of λ0 = −x/2t and of β and η. Inserting the
asymptotic expansions for B−− and b++ into the differential equations (11.51), (11.52)
we obtain expressions for u nk , vnk and ν in terms of u 0 and v0 , i.e., the two unknown
functions u 0 and v0 determine the whole asymptotic expansion (11.68a), (11.68b). But
u 0 and v0 are obtained from the asymptotic analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem (for
the explicit expressions see [173]). Hence we know, in principle, the complete asymptotic
decomposition of the potentials b++ and B−− .
In order to obtain the asymptotics of the two-point Green functions we still need the
asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant. The Fredholm determinant is related to b++ and
B−− through equations (11.56)–(11.58) and (11.53)–(11.55). We may integrate (11.56)–
(11.58) to obtain the asymptotic expansions of ∂x σ and ∂t σ . The integration constant is a
function of β. It is ﬁxed by the leading asymptotics, which, using (11.66), can be obtained
from the direct asymptotic analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. Then, integrating
(11.53)–(11.55) yields σ up to a numerical constant, which follows from the asymptotic
condition (11.59). The calculation is the same as for the impenetrable Bose gas and can be
found on pages 455–457 of [270].

Equations (11.69) and (11.70) are valid for large t and ﬁxed ﬁnite ratio λ0 = −x/2t.
Correlations in the pure space direction t = 0 were discussed in [56]. We would like to
emphasize that (11.69) and (11.70) still hold for arbitrary temperatures. The low temperature
limit will be discussed in the next section. Note that there is no pole of the integrand at
√
η = 0, since ν ∼ |η| for small η and thus C + (λ0 , β, η) ∼ η2 .

11.2.6 Asymptotics in the low-temperature limit
For the following steepest descent calculation we transform the η-integrals in (11.69),
(11.70) into complex contour integrals over the the unit circle, setting z = eiη . Since we
would like to consider low temperatures, we have to restore the explicit temperature dependence by scaling back to the physical space and time variables x and t and to the
physical correlation functions G ±

We would like to calculate the contour integrals (11.77), (11.78) by the method of steepest
descent. For this purpose we have to consider the analytic properties of the integrands. Let
us assume that k0 ≥ 0, and let us cut the complex plane along the real axis from −∞ to
2
−e−β and from −eβ−k0 /T to 0. The integrands in (11.77) and (11.78) can be analytically
continued as functions of z into the cut plane with the only exception of the two simple
poles of F(γ , z) at z = γ ±1 . We may therefore deform the contour of integration as long as
we never cross the cuts and take into account the pole contributions, if we cross z = γ or
z = γ −1 .

This equation was discussed in the appendix of [174]. In [174] it was shown that (11.80)
has exactly one real positive solution which is located in the interval [0, 1]. It was argued
that this solution gives the leading saddle point contribution to (11.77) and (11.78). At small
temperatures (11.80) can be solved explicitly. There are two solutions z ± = ±z c , where

Here D = ∂ P/∂µ is the density of the electron gas. The low-temperature expansion (11.82)
2
is valid in an annulus eβ−k0 /T  |z|  e−β , which lies in our cut plane. The unit circle
and the circle |z| = z c are inside this annulus. We may thus ﬁrst apply (11.82) and then
deform the contour of integration from the unit circle to the small circle |z| = z c . Let
us parameterize the small circle as z = z c eiα , α ∈ [−π, π ]. Then S(z(α)) = −2k0 D((z c −
1)2 + 2z c (1 − cos(α))), which implies that the small circle is a steepest descent contour and
that on this contour S(z − ) ≤ S(z) ≤ S(z + ). The maximum of S(z) on the steepest descent
contour at z = z + is unique and therefore provides the leading saddle point contribution to
(11.77), (11.78) as t → ∞. The saddle point approximation becomes good when t S(z(α)) =
−2k0 Dt((z c − 1)2 + z c α 2 + O(α 4 )) becomes sharply peaked around α = 0. Hence, the
relevant parameter for the calculation of the asymptotics of G ±
↑↑ is 2k0 Dt = x D rather than
−1
t. x D has to be large compared to z c . The parameter x D has a simple interpretation. It is
the average number of particles in the interval [0, x]. Let us consider two different limiting
cases.

11.2 Correlation functions of the impenetrable electron gas

(i) x D → 0, the number of electrons in the interval [0, x] vanishes. In this regime the
interaction of the electrons is negligible. An electron propagates freely from 0 to x.
G±
↑↑ cannot be calculated by the method of steepest descent. We have to use the integral
representation (11.69), (11.70) instead. Since t S(z) and ν(z) tend to zero on the contour
of integration, the integrals in (11.69) and (11.70) are easily calculated. We ﬁnd G ±
↑↑ =
G ±f (see (11.22a), (11.22b)), which is the well known result for free Fermions.
(ii) x D  z c−1 , the average number of electrons in the interval [0, x] is large. This is the
true asymptotic region, x → ∞. In this region the interaction becomes important. At
the same time the method of steepest descent can be used to calculate G ±
↑↑ . This case
will be studied below.
In the process of deformation of the contour from the unit circle to the small circle of
radius z c we may cross the pole of the function F(γ , z) at z = γ −1 . Then we obtain a
contribution of the pole to the asymptotics of G ±
↑↑ . It turns out that the pole contributes to
G±
,
when
the
magnetic
ﬁeld
is
below
a
critical
positive
value, Bc = k02 /4. Below this value
↑↑
the pole contribution always dominates the contribution of the saddle point. Hence, we have
to distinguish two different asymptotic regions, B > Bc and B < Bc . On the other hand, if
we consider the asymptotics for ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld, we have to treat the cases B > 0 and
B ≤ 0 separately. For B > 0 we have to distinguish between a time like regime (k02 < 4B)
and a space-like regime (k02 > 4B). In these respective regimes we obtain the asymptotics
(11.23), (11.25).
In the limit B → −∞, µ → −∞, µ − B ﬁxed there are no ↓-spin electrons left in the
system, D↓ → 0. This is the free Fermion limit. In the free Fermion limit B < Bc , and the
−
asymptotics of G +
↑↑ (x, t) and G ↑↑ (x, t) are given by the equations (11.25), which turn into
the expressions (11.22a), (11.22b) for free Fermions.
The pure time direction k0 = 0 requires a separate calculation. For k0 = 0 the saddle
point equation (11.80) has the solutions z = ±1 for all temperatures. The unit circle is a
steepest-descent contour with unique maximum of S(z) at z = 1, which gives the leading asymptotic contribution to the integrals in (11.77) and (11.78). We ﬁnd algebraically

11.3 Conclusions
In this chapter we have considered dynamical correlations of the Hubbard model in the gas
phase and have obtained explicit expressions for the asymtotics in space and time of the
Green function at small temperature. The results do not rely on ﬁeld theoretical methods,
but rather came out of a direct Bethe ansatz calculation.

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

12.1 Introduction to the quantum inverse scattering method
The quantum inverse scattering method is the modern algebraic theory of exactly solvable
quantum systems. It arose [404, 410, 411] as an attempt to carry over the concepts of the
inverse scattering method for classical non-linear evolution equations [2,134] into quantum
mechanics. As a result, our understanding of both the theory of integrable partial differential
equations and the theory of exactly solvable quantum systems changed, and the algebraic
roots of the exact solvability became apparent. These roots originate from the Yang-Baxter
equation and its classical counterpart.
Before turning to our actual subject, which is the application of the quantum inverse
scattering method to the Hubbard model, we give a brief general introduction. We shall
limit our exposition basically to the material which is needed later for the understanding of
the algebraic structure of the Hubbard model. The reader who is interested in the general
scope of the method and in the history of its development is referred to the excellent books
and review articles [131, 270, 276, 277, 407].

12.1.1 Integrability
As a motivation for the deﬁnition of the Yang-Baxter algebra in the following subsection
we shall ﬁrst recall the concept of integrability in classical mechanics. Then, by considering
the elementary example of the harmonic oscillator, we shall see that this concept does not
directly apply to quantum mechanical systems and needs to be extended.
Consider N classical point particles described by their canonical momenta p =
( p1 , . . . , p N ) and position variables q = (q1 , . . . , q N ). Suppose their dynamics is generated by a Hamiltonian H (p, q) through the canonical equations of motion
ṗ = −

∂H
,
∂q

q̇ =

Suppose further that there are N independent, single-valued and analytic functions I j (p, q),
j = 1, . . . , N , in involution,
{I j , Ik } = 0
393

(12.2)

394

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

(here {·,·} denotes the Poisson bracket), and let H be among the I j . Then Liouville’s
theorem [22] states that the equations of motion (12.1) are ‘solvable by quadratures’. More
precisely, starting from (12.2) a canonical transformation can be constructed, such that the
equations of motion are trivial in the new (action-angle) variables. No further input apart
from the involutive integrals of motion is needed.
The simplest case where the Liouville theorem applies, is the case of conservative
systems with only one degree of freedom. For these systems the Hamiltonian is a
constant of motion. The equation H ( p, q) = E can be solved for p = p(q, E). Thus,
dt = (∂ H ( p(q, E), q)/∂ p)−1 dq, which gives t = t(q) upon integration.
It is probably fair to say that no concept of integrability in quantum mechanics exists which
is as general as Liouville’s theorem. By analogy with the classical case discussed above let
us assume we are given a Hamiltonian H contained in a set of mutually commuting quantum
integrals of motion I j , j = 1, . . . , N . Then there is no general theorem which would explain
how to obtain the spectrum and the eigenfunctions of H from the commutation relations
[I j , Ik ] = 0

(12.3)

alone. The construction of action-angle variables does not easily translate into quantum
mechanics. Additional information is required.
Thinking of those textbook examples which can be algebraically solved by
elementary means, like the harmonic oscillator, the Coulomb problem, the
Morse oscillator or the two-particle Sutherland system, we can get an idea of what kind of
additional information is necessary. We should look for an embedding of the commutative
algebra (12.3) of quantum integrals of motion into some larger algebra, with the space of
states of our system playing the role of the representation space of this algebra. For the examples mentioned above the embedding algebra is a quadratic algebra, either a Lie algebra
or a Lie super algebra.
Let us recall, for instance, the solution of the harmonic oscillator [198]. It relies on the
Heisenberg Lie algebra
[a, a † ] = 1 .

(12.4)

Suppose we are given a highest weight representation of the algebra (12.4), i.e., a representation containing a highest weight state |0 , such that a|0 = 0. Suppose further that a
and a † are mutually adjoint. Let H = a † a + 12 . Equation (12.4) implies that [a, · ] acts as a
derivative on functions of a † , i.e., [a, (a † )n ] = n(a † )n−1 . It follows that


H (a † )n |0 = (a † )n H + [H, (a † )n ] |0


= 12 (a † )n + a † [a, (a † )n ] |0


= n + 12 (a † )n |0 .
(12.5)
Hence, the states |n = (a † )n |0 are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H = a † a + 12 .
The connection to physics comes through the inﬁnite dimensional highest weight representation
a = √12 (x + ∂x ) ,

a † = √12 (x − ∂x )

Note that the above scheme depends only on (i) the algebra (12.4) and (ii) the existence
of the highest-weight state |0 (see (12.7), (12.8)).

12.1.2 The Yang-Baxter algebra
The quantum inverse scattering method deals with systems which are based on an associative
quadratic algebra T R deﬁned in terms of its generators Tβα (λ), α, β = 1, . . . , d; λ ∈ C, by
the relation
R(λ, µ)T1 (λ)T2 (µ) = T2 (µ)T1 (λ)R(λ, µ) .
Here the following notation has been employed
 1

where Id is the d × d unit matrix. R(λ, µ) ∈ End(Cd ⊗ Cd ) is a numerical d 2 × d 2 matrix,
called the R-matrix. The R-matrix ﬁxes the structure of the quadratic algebra T R in a similar
manner as the tensor of structure constants does in case of a Lie algebra. We assume that R
is invertible for almost all λ, µ ∈ C.
The algebra T R thus deﬁned has a rich commutative subalgebra. Multiplying equation
(12.9) by R −1 (λ, µ) from the right and taking the trace we obtain

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

Here and in the following implicit summation with respect to doubly occurring indices is,
understood. With the deﬁnition
t(λ) = Tγγ (λ) = tr(T (λ))

(12.14)

[t(λ), t(µ)] = 0 .

(12.15)

we have the important result

It means that t(λ) is a generating function of a commutative subalgebra of T R , e.g., if
t(λ) = I0 + λI1 + λ2 I2 + . . . , then (12.15) implies that [I j , Ik ] = 0.
Let us assume we are given a representation of T R on the space of states of some physical
system. Then t(λ) generates a set of mutually commuting operators which by construction
are embedded into the quadratic algebra T R . Thus, on the one hand we have a chance to
meet the requirements of Liouville’s theorem in the classical limit (if it exists), while on the
other hand, the quadratic relations of the algebra T R may provide means to simultaneously
diagonalize the quantum integrals of motion, generated by t(λ), in a similar manner as in
our example above of the harmonic oscillator.
Here is the standard terminology for the notions introduced so far: The associative
quadratic algebra T R is the Yang-Baxter algebra. T (λ) is the monodromy matrix and t(λ)
its associated transfer matrix. Their complex argument λ is the spectral parameter. The
space Cd is called the auxiliary space, while the name for the representation space of the
Yang-Baxter algebra usually is quantum space.
Remark. We would like to emphasize that



Id ⊗ T (µ) T (λ) ⊗ Id = T (λ) ⊗ T (µ) ,

(12.16)

γ

since the matrix elements Tβα (λ) and Tδ (µ) of the monodromy matrix, in general, do not
commute.
An alternative way to write the deﬁning relations (12.9) of the Yang-Baxter algebra is by
introduction of a matrix Ř(λ, µ) with matrix elements
αβ

βα

Řγ δ (λ, µ) = Rγ δ (λ, µ) .
It is easy to see that (12.9) is equivalent to

 

Ř(λ, µ) T (λ) ⊗ T (µ) = T (µ) ⊗ T (λ) Ř(λ, µ) .

(12.17)

(12.18)

This formulation is sometimes more convenient for practical calculations.

12.1.3 The Yang-Baxter equation
The Yang-Baxter equation is a sufﬁcient condition for the consistency of the Yang-Baxter
algebra T R . At the same time it guarantees the existence of non-trivial representations of
TR .

12.1 Introduction to the quantum inverse scattering method

397

We embed the algebra T R into the tensor product Cd ⊗ Cd ⊗ Cd of auxiliary spaces,
T1 (λ) = T (λ) ⊗ Id ⊗ Id , T2 (λ) = Id ⊗ T (λ) ⊗ Id , T3 (λ) = Id ⊗ Id ⊗ T (λ), and denote the
three possible canonical embeddings of the R-matrix R(λ, µ) into the space of endomorphisms on Cd ⊗ Cd ⊗ Cd by R12 (λ, µ), R13 (λ, µ) and R23 (λ, µ). Then R12 (λ, µ) =
R(λ, µ) ⊗ Id and R23 (λ, µ) = Id ⊗ R(λ, µ). The third possibility cannot be written in such
αγ
a simple form. From the requirement that (R13 (λ, µ)x ⊗ y ⊗ z)αβγ = Rδϕ (λ, µ)x δ y β z ϕ we
αβγ
αγ
conclude that R13 δεϕ = Rδϕ (λ, µ)δεβ .
Now comes an argument that is very similar to the argument in appendix 3.B.3, where
we encountered the Yang-Baxter equation for the ﬁrst time. From the deﬁnition (12.9) of
the Yang-Baxter algebra it can be seen that there are two different ways to reverse the
order of monodromy matrices in the triple product T1 (λ)T2 (µ)T3 (ν) by application of Rmatrices,
R12 (λ, µ)R13 (λ, ν)R23 (µ, ν)T1 (λ)T2 (µ)T3 (ν)
= T3 (ν)T2 (µ)T1 (λ)R12 (λ, µ)R13 (λ, ν)R23 (µ, ν) ,

(12.19)

R23 (µ, ν)R13 (λ, ν)R12 (λ, µ)T1 (λ)T2 (µ)T3 (ν)
= T3 (ν)T2 (µ)T1 (λ)R23 (µ, ν)R13 (λ, ν)R12 (λ, µ) .

(12.20)

Obviously, these two equations are always compatible, if the R-matrix satisﬁes the
equation
R12 (λ, µ)R13 (λ, ν)R23 (µ, ν) = R23 (µ, ν)R13 (λ, ν)R12 (λ, µ) .

(12.21)

This is the famous Yang-Baxter equation. It is not only a sufﬁcient condition for the consistency of T R as an associative algebra, but also provides its so-called fundamental representation whose construction is the subject of the following subsections.
Most of the known solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation that are connected to applications in physics depend on the spectral parameters only through their difference. In these
cases there exists a matrix R(λ) of a single argument, such that R(λ, µ) = R(λ − µ) solves
the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21). One says R(λ) is a solution of difference form of the
Yang-Baxter equation. Shastry’s R-matrix which connects the Hubbard model to a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation is not of difference form. Therefore we introduced the
Yang-Baxter equation in its more general form (12.21).

12.1.4 The standard basis
In order to obtain convenient expressions for our ﬁnal formulae we ﬁrst have to introduce
some more notation. We shall need the standard basis on the space of endomorphisms,
End(Cd ), on Cd . In the following we denote by eγ ∈ Cd , γ = 1, . . . , d, a column vector
with only non-vanishing entry 1 in row γ . The set {eγ ∈ Cd |γ = 1, . . . , d} is a basis of Cd .
Let eαβ ∈ End(Cd ), such that eαβ eγ = δγβ eα . Then {eαβ ∈ End(Cd )|α, β = 1, . . . , d} is a basis
of End(Cd ). eαβ is a d × d matrix with only non-vanishing entry 1 in row α and column β.

398

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

Hence, the eαβ multiply according to the rule
eαβ eγδ = δγβ eαδ

(12.22)

(compare appendix 3.D.1).
Expressing the same facts in different words, we may also say that the basis {eαβ } is a basis
of the space of operators on the auxiliary space Cd . We shall now consider representations of
the Yang-Baxter algebra, where the quantum space is an L-fold tensor product of auxiliary
spaces Cd . Thus, for d = 2 and L = 1, the quantum space is equal to C2 and can be
interpreted as the space of states of a spin 12 . For d = 2 and arbitrary L it is the space of
states of a spin- 12 quantum spin chain of length L. For d > 2 the spin is replaced by a
generalized so-called su(d) spin. In order to construct operators on the spin chain space of
states we consider the canonical embedding of the basis {eαβ } into End(Cd )⊗L ,
⊗( j−1)

e j βα = Id

⊗(L− j)

⊗ eαβ ⊗ Id

.

(12.23)

The index j = 1, . . . , L will be called the site index. From (12.22) and (12.23) we infer the
local multiplication rule
e j βα e j δγ = δγβ e j δα

(12.24)

[e j βα , ek δγ ] = 0

(12.25)

and the commutation relations

for j = k.
With the aid of the basic operators e j βα we can conveniently express arbitrary more
complicated operators of interest. We can, for instance, expand the canonical embeddings
R jk (λ, µ) of the R-matrix in the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21) in terms of the e j βα . Let
L = 3. Then
αγ

R jk (λ, µ) = Rβδ e j βα ek δγ

(12.26)

for jk = 12, 13, 23.
We also obtain a very useful expression for the transposition operators P jk which play an
important role below in the construction of integrable lattice models with local interactions,
P jk = e j βα ek αβ .

(12.27)

The following properties of the transposition operators are easily veriﬁed. They follow from
(12.24) and (12.25),
Pk j = P jk ,

(12.28a)

P j j = d · id ,

j = k ,

P jk el βα = el βα P jk ,

(12.28c)
(12.28d)
l = j, k .

(12.28e)

12.1 Introduction to the quantum inverse scattering method

399

We see from these formulae that the P jk induce the action of the symmetric group on the site
indices of the matrices e j βα . Because of (12.28d) and (12.28e), the P jk generate a faithful
representation of the symmetric group S L ,
P jk Pkl = P jl P jk = Pkl P jl .

(12.29)

Combining the deﬁnitions (12.17) and (12.27) with (12.26) and using (12.24) and (12.25)
we obtain Ř jk (λ, µ) = P jk R jk (λ, µ). This allows us to rewrite the Yang-Baxter equation
in an alternative form, for multiplication of (12.21) by P23 P12 P23 = P12 P23 P12 yields
Ř23 (λ, µ) Ř12 (λ, ν) Ř23 (µ, ν) = Ř12 (µ, ν) Ř23 (λ, ν) Ř12 (λ, µ) .

(12.30)

Written in this form the Yang-Baxter equation is of striking similarity with the braid relation
(3.C.2a). In fact, every representation of the braid relation (3.C.2a) in End(Cd ⊗ Cd ) gives
a spectral parameter independent solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.30). Again, if
Ř(λ, µ) = Ř(λ − µ), then Ř(λ) is said to be a solution of difference form of (12.30).

12.1.5 Fundamental models
We shall now explain how solutions the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21) give rise to representations of the Yang-Baxter algebra (12.18). First, using (12.24) and (12.25), we rewrite
the Yang-Baxter equation in components,

(12.31)

Next, we introduce the L-matrix at site j by deﬁning its matrix elements
αγ

L j αβ (λ, µ) = Rβδ (λ, µ)e j δγ .

(12.32)


⊗L
These matrix elements are operators in End(Cd ) . Multiplication of the Yang-Baxter

equation (12.31) by e j γγ implies that
 


(12.33)
Ř(λ, µ) L j (λ, ν) ⊗ L j (µ, ν) = L j (µ, ν) ⊗ L j (λ, ν) Ř(λ, µ) .
Thus, L j (λ, ν) is a representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra (12.18). This representation
is called the fundamental representation.
γ
From (12.25) and (12.32) we know that [L j+1 αβ (λ, ν j+1 ), L j δ (λ, ν j )] = 0. It follows that



L j+1 (λ, ν j+1 ) ⊗ L j+1 (µ, ν j+1 ) L j (λ, ν j ) ⊗ L j (µ, ν j )
= L j+1 (λ, ν j+1 )L j (λ, ν j ) ⊗ L j+1 (µ, ν j+1 )L j (µ, ν j ) .

(12.34)

Thus, (12.33) and (12.34) imply that the product L j+1 (λ, ν j+1 )L j (λ, ν j ) of two L-matrices
as well is a representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra (12.18). This representation may
be interpreted as a tensor product representation of two fundamental representations. The
property of the Yang-Baxter algebra, that a tensor product of two representations is a
representation, is called the co-multiplication property. By iterated co-multiplication we

400

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

can easily verify that the L-fold ordered product of L-matrices
T (λ) = L L (λ, ν L ) . . . L 1 (λ, ν1 )

(12.35)

is a representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra (12.18). The trace of this monodromy matrix, t(λ) = tr(T (λ)), belongs by construction to a commuting family of transfer matrices,
[t(λ), t(µ)] = 0.
A solution R(λ, µ) of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31) is called regular, if there are
αβ
values λ0 , ν0 of the spectral parameters, such that Rγ δ (λ0 , ν0 ) = δδα δγβ . For a regular Rmatrix it follows from the deﬁnition (12.32) that
L j αβ (λ0 , ν0 ) = e j αβ .

(12.36)

Setting ν j = ν0 for j = 1, . . . , L in (12.35) and using the deﬁnition of the transposition
operator (12.27) we obtain

(12.37)

where the operator Û deﬁned by the last equation (12.37) is the right-shift operator, which
is the generator of cyclic shifts of the site index.
Along with the transfer matrix t(λ) itself every appropriately chosen differentiable function of t(λ) may be used as a generating function of a set of mutually commuting operators.
A particularly useful choice of a generating function is τ (λ) = ln(Û −1 t(λ)). Its expansion
around λ = λ0 is


(12.38)
τ (λ) = (λ − λ0 )Û −1 t  (λ0 ) + O (λ − λ0 )2 .
It can be shown [308] that the coefﬁcients in the series expansion are local in the sense, that
the nth coefﬁcient is a sum over local densities acting non-trivially at n + 1 neighbouring
sites at most. The two-site term

where periodic boundary conditions on the indices are again implied. Note that no closed,
explicit formula for the nth order term is known. The calculation of the higher order derivatives of τ (λ) is cumbersome. A more efﬁcient way of calculating higher local commuting
operators is by means of a recursion relation generated by the so-called boost operator1 [453].
The higher order commuting operators usually do not have a simple intuitive interpretation
in physical terms, and their explicit form does not matter much for applications.2 They are
mostly interesting for their bare existence which says something about the mathematical
structure of the model.
One says that equation (12.35) deﬁnes the fundamental model associated with the Rmatrix R(λ, ν). If all the ν j , j = 1, . . . , L, are equal, the model is called homogeneous,
otherwise inhomogeneous. Only the homogeneous model leads to the local Hamiltonian
H , equation (12.39).
We have encountered a particular example of a fundamental inhomogeneous model in
appendix 3.B, where the Bethe ansatz wave function of the Hubbard model was constructed. The ‘spin problem’ obtained after inserting the ansatz for the wavefunction into
the Schrödinger equation led us to consider the transfer matrix of the inhomogeneous XXX
model (see appendix 3.B.5). In the following subsection we will recall and partly generalize
our former results.
Before closing this subsection let us add a comment. Fundamental models are only
a small subclass of all models solvable by the quantum inverse scattering method. This
subclass, however, contains many models which are interesting from the point of view
1
2

For a boost operator related to the Hubbard model see [301].
There is, however, an interesting conclusion that can be drawn from (12.43): if the R-matrix is unitary (see (12.46) below) and

of difference form, then the ﬁrst two terms under the sum cancel each other and Lj=1 [H j−1, j , H j, j+1 ] commutes with the
Hamiltonian. This gives us a simple criterion to test whether a local Hamiltonian H j−1, j can be connected to a fundamental
model with unitary R-matrix of difference form.

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

of applications in physics. If we allow for a slight generalization to so-called fundamental
graded models [179] which will be discussed in Section 12.3 below, then the models which
interest us the most (i.e., the isotropic Heisenberg chain, the t-0 model, the supersymmetric
t-J model and the Hubbard model) are all contained in this class. This is the reason why we
restrict our discussion to fundamental models here. For additional introductory information
about non-fundamental models the reader is referred to the literature (e.g. [270, 277]).

12.1.6 An example – the XXX models
We now reconsider and generalize the inhomogeneous XXX model we have encountered in
appendix 3.B.5. Having in mind the construction of another class of fundamental models in
the next section we offer a slightly more abstract point of view. Classes of solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation can often be constructed by ﬁrst considering an appropriate algebra,
which provides a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation without spectral parameter, and, in a
second step, attempting to introduce a spectral parameter into the equations. This procedure
has the advantage that every representation of the algebra at hand gives a new solution of
the Yang-Baxter equation.
Let us, for instance, consider the associative algebra with unity ‘id’ deﬁned in terms of
its generators Ai , i = 1, . . . , L, by the relations
Ai Ai+1 Ai = Ai+1 Ai Ai+1 ,

(12.44a)

Ai A j = A j Ai

(12.44b)

for |i − j| > 1 ,

Ai2 = id ,

(12.44c)

where A L+1 = A1 by deﬁnition. Comparing with (3.C.2) we see that this algebra is isomorphic to the group algebra of the symmetric group S L . Note that the braid relation (12.44a) is
very similar to a spectral parameter independent form of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.30).
A short calculation, similar to the one in appendix (3.C.1) shows that
(id + λA2 )(id + (λ + µ)A1 )(id + µA2 ) = (id + µA1 )(id + (λ + µ)A2 )(id + λA1 ).
(12.45)
Clearly, the transposition operators Pii+1 , equation (12.27), provide a representation Ai =
Pii+1 of (12.44). Let P = eαβ ⊗ eβα . Then, by (12.45), the matrix Ř(λ) = α(λ)(id + λP),
with an arbitrary function α(λ), is a solution of difference form of the Yang-Baxter equation
(12.30). Note that since d = 2, 3, 4, . . . is arbitrary, we have obtained solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation of arbitrarily high dimension. The arbitrary function α(λ) could be
introduced because of the homogeneity of the Yang-Baxter equation. It is still at our disposal.
We may choose it in such a way that the matrix Ř(λ) has a convenient normalization.
Choosing, for instance, α(λ) = 1/(λ + 1) we ﬁnd
Ř(λ) Ř(−λ) = id
which follows from P 2 = id. An R-matrix having this property is called unitary.

(12.46)

12.1 Introduction to the quantum inverse scattering method

403

In order to make contact with our notation in appendix 3.B.5 we rescale the spectral parameter, λ → λ/ic, where c is some coupling constant. It follows that the
matrix
Ř(λ) =

ic · id + λP
ic + λ

(12.47)

is a solution of difference form of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.30). Upon introducing
functions
b(λ) =

ic

λ + ic

c(λ) =

λ

λ + ic

(12.48)

the matrix Ř(λ) takes the form
Ř(λ) = b(λ)id + c(λ)P .

(12.49)

For the particular case d = 2, for instance, this is the 4 × 4 matrix

and agrees with equation (3.B.58), if we put c = 2u.
Having obtained a set of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation we may now apply the
formalism of the previous section and construct the corresponding fundamental models.
We should remark that the construction of the fundamental models in the previous section
is not unique and may be altered by a number of rather trivial transformations, like shifts or
rescaling of the spectral parameter, or multiplication of, for instance, the Hamiltonian by a
number. We shall freely use this possibility.
Let us write down the R-matrix R(λ, µ) = P Ř(λ, µ) with Ř(λ, µ) obtained from (12.49)
in components. We have
R(λ, µ) = c(λ − µ)id + b(λ − µ)P

(12.51)

and the components of the R-matrix can be read off from the right hand side of this equation.
It follows (see (12.32)) that
L j αβ (λ, µ) = c(λ − µ)δβα + b(λ − µ)e j αβ .

(12.52)

Since b(0) = 1 and c(0) = 0, the R-matrix (12.51) is regular. The monodromy matrix of
the corresponding fundamental model is given by equation (12.35) with L j αβ (λ, ν j ) taken
from (12.52). As the Hamiltonian density in the homogeneous case we choose (compare

deﬁnes the so-called su(d)-XXX chain.
The transfer matrix of the su(d)-XXX chain can be diagonalized by using the YangBaxter algebra (12.18). The procedure is called the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and is
a generalization of the method presented in appendix 3.B.5. The nested algebraic Bethe
ansatz for the su(d)-XXX chain was constructed by Kulish and Reshetikhin [273]. We shall
not discuss it at this point, since it would lead us too far away from our actual subject. Let us
only reconsider the arguments for the case d = 2 in a different, more general form. This is
sufﬁcient for our purpose to give an example of how the algebraic Bethe ansatz works and
will moreover be useful for the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model in Section
12.6 and for the quantum transfer matrix approach to the thermodynamics of the XXX chain
in Chapter 13.

12.1.7 Algebraic Bethe ansatz for the gl(2) generalized model
The models connected to the Yang-Baxter algebra are interesting for physicists mainly,
because powerful methods are available for the solution of their spectral problem. One of
these methods is the algebraic Bethe ansatz. It relies on the direct use of the quadratic
commutation relations (12.18) deﬁning the Yang-Baxter algebra. In order for the algebraic
Bethe ansatz to work it must be possible to identify the elements of the monodromy matrix
as ‘particle’ creation and annihilation operators. In particular, a pseudo vacuum state must
exist which is annihilated by all the annihilation operators. In all known cases, where an
algebraic Bethe ansatz has been successful so far, the elements of the monodromy matrix

12.1 Introduction to the quantum inverse scattering method

405

could be arranged in such a way, that the monodromy matrix acts as an upper triangular
matrix on the pseudo vacuum, and the pseudo vacuum is an eigenstate of its diagonal
elements.
The paradigmatic example of an algebraic Bethe ansatz is the algebraic Bethe ansatz for
models with the R-matrix (12.50) of the spin- 12 XXX chain [132]. The monodromy matrices
of these models are 2 × 2. Thus, they have only a single element below the diagonal which
must annihilate the pseudo vacuum for the algebraic Bethe ansatz to work. It turns out that
the particular form of the vacuum eigenvalues of the diagonal elements is irrelevant for
the construction of the algebraic Bethe ansatz. These vacuum eigenvalues, usually denoted
a(λ) and d(λ), enter the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution as functional parameters. Thus, the
algebraic Bethe ansatz can be simultaneously constructed for a whole class of models with
the same R-matrix. One may even think of a model deﬁned by the functional parameters
and the triangular action of the monodromy matrix on the pseudo vacuum. The question
whether or not such kind of ‘generalized model’ exists for arbitrary parameters a(λ) and
d(λ) was ﬁrst addressed in [267] and after some reﬁnement was answered in the afﬁrmative
in [449, 450]. The model has been termed the gl(2) generalized model, because of the gl(2)
invariance of the R-matrix (12.50).
The algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the spin- 12 XXX chain presented in appendix 3.B.5
is a special case of the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the gl(2) generalized model. In
principle, the arguments given in appendix 3.B.5 also apply to the gl(2) generalized model.
Here, however, we shall take the opportunity to present an alternative derivation of the
algebraic Bethe ansatz solution. We shall start by making the notion of the gl(2) generalized
model more precise.
Let us consider the Yang-Baxter algebra (12.18) with R-matrix (12.50). The corresponding monodromy matrix is a 2 × 2 matrix, say,


A(λ) B(λ)
T (λ) =
.
(12.56)
C(λ) D(λ)
The gl(2) generalized model is the set of all (linear) representations of the Yang-Baxter
algebra (12.18) with R-matrix (12.50), for which a pseudo vacuum |0 exists, such that
T (λ) acts triangularly on |0 ,
A(λ)|0 = a(λ)|0 ,
C(λ)|0 = 0 .

D(λ)|0 = d(λ)|0 ,

(12.57)
(12.58)

The complex valued functions a(λ) and d(λ) are called the parameters of the generalized model. These parameters characterize the representation in much the same way
as the highest-weight vector characterizes a highest-weight representation of a Lie
algebra.
Let us denote the representation space of a given representation of the generalized model
by H. It is clear from the quadratic commutation relations contained in (12.18) and from

406

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

(12.57), (12.58) that we may assume H to be spanned by all vectors of the form
|µ1 , . . . , µ M = B(µ1 ) . . . B(µ M )|0 .

(12.59)

This assumption is at least sensible if H is ﬁnite dimensional.
The family of transfer matrices we want to diagonalize is given by
t(λ) = tr(T (λ)) = A(λ) + D(λ) .

(12.60)

This is a commuting family of transfer matrices, [t(λ), t(µ)] = 0, by construction (see
Section 12.1.2). Therefore t(λ) and t(µ) have a common system of eigenfunctions, which
means that the eigenvectors of t(λ) are independent of the spectral parameter λ. The task
of the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the generalized model is to diagonalize t(λ), i.e., to solve
the eigenvalue problem
t(λ)| = (λ)| .

(12.61)

This task can be accomplished by solely resorting to the Yang-Baxter algebra (12.18) and
the properties (12.57), (12.58) of the pseudo vacuum state.
Out of the 16 quadratic relations contained in (12.18) we select the following three,
A(λ)B(µ) =

B(µ)A(λ) b(µ − λ)
−
B(λ)A(µ) ,
c(µ − λ)

We are interested in the commutation relation of a product B(µ1 ) . . . B(µ M ) with A(λ) and
D(λ). These commutation relations can be obtained by iterated use of (12.62). We claim

which, for mutually distinct µk , can be easily proven by means of Liouville’s theorem.3
It follows that (12.63a) is true for all M ∈ N. The proof of (12.63b) is almost literally the

By hypothesis, |0 is a joint eigenvector of A(λ) and D(λ) with eigenvalues a(λ) and d(λ)

t(λ) with eigenvalue (λ) if the equations (12.68) are satisﬁed. These equations are, of
course, nothing but the Bethe ansatz equations.
As an application of our abstract Bethe ansatz solution let us again consider the
spin- 12 XXX chain. The monodromy matrix (12.35) is then an L-fold product of elementary
L-matrices (12.52). It deﬁnes a representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra with R-matrix
 ⊗L
(12.50). An appropriate pseudo vacuum is the ferromagnetic state |0 = 10 . The only
thing we need to do if we want to apply our general result (12.67), (12.68) is to calculate
the parameters a(λ) and d(λ). We note that

In order to compare with our previous result obtained in appendix 3.B.5 we have to
adjust the notation. Replacing (λ) with τ (λ), λ with λ − ic/2, µk with λk − ic/2, ν j with
sin(k j ), c with 2u, and L with N , we reproduce equations (3.B.83) and (3.B.84) from
(12.67), (12.68), and (12.70).
In the homogeneous case, ν j = 0, j = 1, . . . , L, equations (12.67), (12.68) and (12.70)
provide the eigenvalues E of the spin- 12 XXX Hamiltonian (12.54). Comparing (12.39),

Let us set µk = λk − ic/2 in equations (12.68) and (12.71) and c = 2 in (12.54), (12.68)

A number of comments are in order here. The isotropic spin- 12 Heisenberg chain is one
of the best understood models that can be solved by algebraic Bethe ansatz. Lemma 9
is only the starting point for the study of its physical properties. Its thermodynamics, its
excitation spectrum in the thermodynamic limit, its S-matrix and its ﬁnite size corrections
which determine the long-distance behaviour of correlations, can be obtained in much the
same way as discussed with the example of the Hubbard model in the ﬁrst part of this book.
In Chapter 13 where we treat the quantum transfer matrix approach to the thermodynamics
of the Hubbard model we shall come back to the isotropic Heisenberg chain in order to
introduce the method with a sufﬁciently simple example. For further reading we refer to
the article [132] and to the books [157, 270, 439]. In [132] it is shown that, due to the su(2)
symmetry, we should have imposed the restriction 2M ≤ L in lemma 9.
The algebraic Bethe ansatz also provides a relatively simple expression for the eigenvectors and is therefore a powerful tool for the calculation of local properties of the spin- 12
XXX chain. The norm of the eigenvectors was obtained in [268]. Expressions for expectation values of local operators in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots have been derived in [413]
(see also [251]).
It is interesting to compare the two derivations of the algebraic Bethe ansatz in appendix 3.B.5 and in this section. The approach of appendix 3.B.5 is constructive but nonrigorous, since we have implicitly assumed the linear independence of vectors of the form
B(µ1 ) . . . B(µ M )|0 . The approach of this section is rigorous but non-constructive. Induction over M is mathematically elegant, but only helpful once the result is known. Thus, it
is useful to be aware of both approaches.
The algebraic Bethe ansatz is not the only approach to solve the spectral problem of
models connected with the Yang-Baxter algebra. It is only applicable if a pseudo vacuum
exists. For models like the Toda chain [405], which has the same R-matrix as the spin- 12
XXX chain, but has no pseudo vacuum, the algebraic Bethe ansatz fails. For these types of
models another powerful technique, the ‘method of separation of variables’ was devised by
E. K. Sklyanin [408].

12.1.8 Graphical representation of the Yang-Baxter equation
So far we have developed the formalism of the quantum inverse scattering method in a
purely algebraic language. In this subsection we will slightly detour from this route and give

410

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

a complementary view on the method. R-matrices can be represented by graphs. Relations
between products of R-matrices then become relations between graphs or graphical rules for
calculations. The use of these graphical rules sometimes simpliﬁes complicated algebraic
proofs. The origin of the graphical representation is the statistical mechanics of vertex
models [45]. For many purposes it is mainly a matter of personal taste or habits whether
one prefers to work with the algebraic or with the graphical representation. We shall use
the graphical representation in our next chapter on the quantum transfer matrix approach
to thermodynamics. But here is the appropriate place to introduce it.
Let us represent R(λ, µ) by two crossing arrows, one of which is thought of to ‘carry’
the spectral parameter λ, the other one the spectral parameter µ. Such kind of symbol may
alternatively be understood as a (directed) vertex. Let us attach indices α, β, γ , δ to the four
ends of the vertex. The indices at the tips of the arrows will be called outgoing indices
and the indices at the tails incoming indices. The attachment of the indices to the vertex is
unique if we agree to put them in clockwise order, starting with α as ‘leftmost’ outgoing
index. This way we also establish a unique correspondence between the outgoing indices
α and β and the spectral parameters λ and µ. Thus, we may uniquely identify an R-matrix
αβ
element Rγ δ (λ, µ) with a labeled vertex,
β

αβ

R γ δ (λ, m)

=

α

λ

.

γ

(12.75)

The key point now that makes the graphical representation suitable for calculations is to
symbolize contraction of indices by connection of lines. Then we have, for instance,

In this equation it is implied that the arrow from β  to α carries the same spectral parameter
λ throughout. It is consistent with our sum convention to deﬁne

(12.77)

With the aid of our rules we may express various identities involving the R-matrix in
graphical form. The Yang-Baxter equation is shown in ﬁgure 12.1. In its graphical form it
is probably most easily memorized. Attaching labels to the graphs and using (12.75) we
can easily reconstruct equation (12.31) from ﬁgure 12.1. The unitarity condition is shown

Chapter 13.

12.2 Shastry’s R-matrix
Soon after the quantum inverse scattering method was created it became apparent that most
of the models solvable by coordinate Bethe ansatz can be connected to the Yang-Baxter
algebra. Yet it turned out to be difﬁcult to ﬁnd an R-matrix associated with the Hubbard
model. The reason is that due to an argument of Reshetikhin [277] the Hubbard model
cannot be constructed as a fundamental model with an R-matrix of difference form. Another
source of obstruction is provided by the fact that the Hubbard model is formulated in terms
of fermionic rather than spin degrees of freedom. This problem can be circumvented by
considering the spin model related to the Hubbard model by a Jordan-Wigner transformation
[227]. An R-matrix for this spin model was obtained by B. S. Shastry in 1986 [391, 392].
As we shall see, Shastry’s R-matrix is rather peculiar as compared to the R-matrices of
most of the other prominent exactly solvable models. In particular, it is not of difference
form. Let us emphasize that the algebraic structure of the Hubbard model is less simple and
less well understood than, for instance, the algebraic structure of the isotropic Heisenberg
chain. From the point of view of its algebraic structure the Hubbard model is the subject of
recent and still ongoing work. Therefore, the results presented in this part of the book are
less complete than the results of the ﬁrst parts. We expect further interesting developments
in the future in which the reader is invited to participate.

412

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

Shastry’s original work [391, 392] relies on rather brute force calculations involving extensive computer algebra. Later on, in an elegant paper [393], he introduced a novel algebraic
means, the so-called ‘decorated star triangle relation’ that enabled to derive the R-matrix simultaneously with a peculiar representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra. This construction,
however, did not include a proof showing that the R-matrix thus constructed would satisfy
the Yang-Baxter equation. An algebraic proof based on Korepanov’s representation [264]
of the tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebra was given by Shiroishi and Wadati [401].
Another derivation of Shastry’s R-matrix was obtained in [349, 475], where a (quantum)
Lax pair [270] was constructed, and the R-matrix was obtained from the requirement that the
L-matrix elements should generate a representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra. In [349] a
fermionic form of the Yang-Baxter algebra for the Hubbard model was introduced for the ﬁrst
time. The corresponding R-matrix turned out to be slightly modiﬁed as compared to Shastry’s R-matrix. As we shall see below (see lemma 12) the two R-matrices are related through
a ‘generalized twist transformation’ which leaves the Yang-Baxter equation invariant.
Our account of the algebraic structure of the Hubbard model does not rely on [349]. It is
based on Shastry’s R-matrix and on a general formalism [179] that associates a fermionic, socalled fundamental graded model with every solution of the Yang-Baxter equation satisfying
a certain compatibility condition. We shall use an R-matrix that again connects to Shastry’s
R-matrix by a generalized twist. This whole section is devoted to the derivation of Shastry’s
R-matrix and to the discussion of similarity transformations which leave the Yang-Baxter
equation invariant. Fundamental graded model are introduced in the following Section
12.3.
In the derivation of Shastry’s R-matrix we partly follow the article [312], where a purely
algebraic version of Shastry’s arguments [393] has been presented. The derivation of [312]
gives rise to a whole family of fundamental models with su(n)-spin degrees of freedom,
the simplest of which (n = 2) is related to the Hubbard model through a Jordan-Wigner
transformation. The proof that these R-matrices actually solve the Yang-Baxter equation is
shown in appendix 12.A. It relies on the work of Korepanov [263] and is due to Shiroishi
and Wadati [401]. A generalized twist transformation transforms Shastry’s R-matrix into
an R-matrix that generates the Hubbard model as a fundamental graded model. It is this
R-matrix that we shall use as the starting point for the exploration of the algebraic properties
of the Hubbard model in Section 12.4.

12.2.1 The XX models
We start our considerations by introducing the su(d)-XX models which will serve as building
blocks for the construction of Shastry’s R-matrix.

where periodic boundary conditions, σ0α = σ Lα , α = x, y, z, are implied and Jx , Jy and Jz
are three generally distinct ‘exchange couplings’. H X Y Z is called the XYZ Hamiltonian.
The XYZ Hamiltonian is connected to Baxter’s famous eight-vertex model solution of
the Yang-Baxter equation [43–45]. For Jx = Jy the Hamiltonian describes the partially
anisotropic so-called XXZ model. The completely isotropic case Jx = Jy = Jz is called the
XXX model and was considered along with its su(d) generalizations in the previous section.
Here we shall discuss another interesting family of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation
connected to a special choice of exchange couplings in (12.79). For Jx = Jy = J/2 and
Jz = 0 the XYZ Hamiltonian becomes

(12.80)

We call this the XX Hamiltonian. Other common names are XY Hamiltonian or XX0
Hamiltonian, respectively. As in case of the XXX model there is a whole family of su(d)
generalizations (d = 3, 4, . . . ) of the XX model. This family of models will be constructed
below. The XX model relates to the tight binding model of free spinless fermions through
a Jordan-Wigner transformation (see Section 12.3). As mentioned above it will serve as a
building block for the construction of Shastry’s R-matrix in the next subsection.
Let us consider the associative algebra with unity deﬁned in terms of its generators Ai ,
i = 1, . . . , L, by the relations
Ai Ai+1 Ai = 0 = Ai+1 Ai Ai+1 ,

(12.81a)

(12.81b)

for |i − j| > 1 ,

Ai3 = Ai ,
{Ai2 , Ai±1 } = Ai±1 ,

(12.81c)
(12.81d)

where we impose periodic boundary conditions on the generators. The curly brackets in
the last line denote the anticommutator. The algebra deﬁned by (12.81) was introduced by
Maassarani [312] and was termed ‘free fermion algebra’. Note that (12.81a) means that the
Ai satisfy the braid relation. Using (12.81c) and (12.81d) we see that the same is also true

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

The latter equation constitutes an abstract solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. Let
αγ
Q ∈ End(Cd ⊗ Cd ), such that Ai = Q ii+1 = Q βδ ei βα ei+1 δγ is a representation of the free
fermion algebra. Let P (1) = Q 2 and P (2) = id − P (1) . Then (12.82) implies that
Ř(λ) = P (1) + P (2) cos(λ) + Q sin(λ)

(12.83)

is a solution of difference form of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.30). This solution is regular,
since
Ř(0) = P (1) + P (2) = id .

(12.84)

From the deﬁning relations of the free fermion algebra we conclude that P (1) and P (2) form
a complete set of projection operators,
P (i) P ( j) = δi j P ( j) ,

i, j = 1, 2 .

(12.85)

The operator Q, being the square root of P (1) , satisﬁes
P (1) Q = Q P (1) = Q ,

(12.86a)

P (2) Q = Q P (2) = 0 .

(12.86b)

Using (12.85) and (12.86) it follows that
Ř(λ) Ř(−λ) = cos2 (λ) · id .

(12.87)

Thus Ř(λ)/ cos(λ) is unitary. According to equation (12.40) the Hamiltonian density of the
fundamental homogeneous model generated by Ř(λ) is
H j−1, j = ∂λ Ř j−1 j (λ)

λ=0

= Q j−1 j .

(12.88)

The work that remains to be done is to construct representations of the free fermion
algebra (12.81). We have claimed that we would construct the R-matrix of the XX model
and its su(d) generalizations. Then, by comparing (12.80) and (12.88) the Hamiltonian deny
y
x
sity 12 (σ j−1
σ jx + σ j−1 σ j ) = e j−1 21 e j 12 + e j−1 12 e j 21 should generate the free fermion algebra
(12.81). This is indeed the case. We have, for instance,
(e1 21 e2 12 + e1 12 e2 21 )(e2 21 e3 12 + e2 12 e3 21 )(e1 21 e2 12 + e1 12 e2 21 )
= (e1 21 e2 22 e3 12 + e1 12 e2 11 e3 21 )(e1 21 e2 12 + e1 12 e2 21 ) = 0 ,

(12.89)

and the ﬁrst relation (12.81a) is veriﬁed. The remaining relations (12.81) are veriﬁed by
similar calculations. Hence,
Q = e12 ⊗ e21 + e21 ⊗ e12

(12.90)

generates a representation of the free fermion algebra (12.81).
This result straightforwardly generalizes. One veriﬁes by direct calculation that Ai =

and d = 2, 3, 4, . . . generates a representation of the algebra (12.81). Here x ∈ C is a free
parameter. Thus, because of (12.83), we have obtained the following solution of difference

(12.92)

This solution was originally obtained in [313]. Our derivation follows [312]. The fundamental models generated by R(λ) = P Ř(λ) are called the su(d)-XX models. Note that these
models (for d > 2) are not just degenerate special cases of the higher rank X X Z models
(see e.g. [47]).
Later, when we derive an explicit 16 × 16-matrix expression of Shastry’s R-matrix for
the Hubbard model, we shall need the explicit form of Ř(λ) in the case of a two-dimensional
auxiliary space, d = 2,

In this case, the same R-matrix (with x = 1) can also be obtained as an appropriate limit
of Baxter’s R-matrix of the eight-vertex model [45].
In the following subsection we shall use the R-matrices (12.92) as building blocks for
the construction of a family of R-matrices related to the Hubbard model. Note, however,
that the XX models are also interesting on their own right. The su(3)-XX R-matrix, for
instance, generates the t-0 model [179] (see appendix 2.A.6).

12.2.2 Conjugation matrix and decorated Yang-Baxter equation
Shastry’s R-matrix is built by gluing together two copies of the XX models by means of a
‘conjugation matrix’ C ∈ End(Cd ). Following [312] we characterize it by its properties:
C 2 = Id ,
C1 Q 12 = Q 12 C2 ,

{Ci , Q 12 } = 0,

i = 1, 2,

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model
( j)

What is the use of this conjugation matrix? (12.94a) implies [Ci , P12 ] = 0 for i, j = 1, 2.
Hence (see (12.83)),
Ci Ř12 (λ) = Ř12 (−λ)Ci ,

i = 1, 2 .

(12.96)

The conjugation matrix thus changes the sign of the argument of Ř(λ). It can be used to
show that the XX-model R-matrices satisfy another functional equation besides the YangBaxter equation. For this purpose let us ﬁrst rewrite the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21) in
difference form,
R12 (λ − µ)R13 (λ)R23 (µ) = R23 (µ)R13 (λ)R12 (λ − µ) .

(12.97)

Here we shifted λ and µ by ν. Then we multiply (12.97) by C1 C2 from the left and by C3
from the right and reverse the sign of µ. We obtain the so-called decorated Yang-Baxter
equation,
R12 (λ + µ)C1 R13 (λ)R23 (µ) = R23 (µ)R13 (λ)C1 R12 (λ + µ) .

(12.98)

An equivalent form of this equation was introduced by Shastry in [393] and termed ‘decorated star triangle relation’.

12.2.3 Constructing the R-matrix
Now we are prepared to introduce Shastry’s R-matrix in the generalized form constructed
by Maassarani [311,312]. It is composed of two copies of the XX-model R-matrix (12.92).
Its construction is based on equations (12.97), (12.98) and on the properties (12.94) of the
conjugation matrix.
Let us ﬁrst consider a system consisting of two non-interacting XX-models. We deﬁne
αγ

ř↑ (λ) = Řβδ (λ) eαβ ⊗ Id ⊗ eγδ ⊗ Id ,
αγ

ř↓ (λ) = Řβδ (λ) Id ⊗ eαβ ⊗ Id ⊗ eγδ ,

(12.99a)
(12.99b)

where Ř(λ) is the XX-model R-matrix (12.92), and the associated transposition matrices
P↑ = eαβ ⊗ Id ⊗ eβα ⊗ Id ,

P↓ = Id ⊗ eαβ ⊗ Id ⊗ eβα .

(12.100)

Then, by construction, both matrices, r↑ (λ) = P↑ř↑ (λ) and r↓ (λ) = P↓ř↓ (λ), satisfy the
Yang-Baxter equation in its difference form (12.97). Since they commute the same is trivially
true for their product
r (λ) = r↑ (λ)r↓ (λ) ,

(12.101)

it satisﬁes (12.97). r (λ) is acting on the tensor product (Cd ⊗ Cd ) ⊗ (Cd ⊗ Cd ) of two
2
auxiliary spaces Cd ⊗ Cd . The vector space Cd ⊗ Cd is isomorphic to Cd . Hence, we can
2
2
interpret r (λ) as a matrix in End(Cd ⊗ Cd ) if we employ the usual conventions e11 ⊗ e11 →
e11 , e11 ⊗ e21 → e21 etc. for the tensor product of two matrices. Then r (λ) is a d 4 × d 4 -matrix.

12.2 Shastry’s R-matrix

2

The transposition operator P which interchanges the two tensor factors in Cd ⊗ Cd is
given by the product P = P↑ P↓ .
Let us brieﬂy consider the fundamental model associated with the R-matrix r (λ). We
have to follow the steps in Section (12.1.5). The L-matrix with components
αγ

 j αβ (λ) = rβδ (λ)e j δγ ,

(12.102)

where all Greek indices run from 1 to d 2 and summation over γ and δ is implied, generates
a fundamental representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra,

 

ř (λ − µ)  j (λ) ⊗  j (µ) =  j (µ) ⊗  j (λ) ř (λ − µ) .
(12.103)
Due to the regularity of the XX-model R-matrix we have ř  (0) = ř↑ (0) + ř↓ (0). Therefore
(see equation (12.40)) the Hamiltonian of the corresponding homogeneous model is equal
to
H=

j=1

with Q σ = řσ (0), σ =↑, ↓. It is clear by construction that Q ↑ and Q ↓ commute. These
operators correspond to two independent embeddings of Q into Cd ⊗ Cd ⊗ Cd ⊗ Cd . The
Hamiltonian (12.104) may thus be understood as a direct sum of two XX Hamiltonians.
In order to couple the two XX models we shall need two commuting copies, C ↑ = C ⊗ Id
and C ↓ = Id ⊗ C, of the conjugation matrix (12.95). The matrix r (λ) then satisﬁes (12.98)
with C replaced by C ↑ C ↓ . It follows that

ř (λ + µ) C ↑ C ↓ ⊗ Id 2  j (λ) ⊗  j (µ)



=  j (µ) ⊗  j (λ) Id 2 ⊗ C ↑ C ↓ ř (λ + µ) .
(12.105)
It was Shastry’s original observation [393] that (12.103) and (12.105) can be used to
construct a representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra which is related to the Hubbard model
together with its R-matrix. Later, Maassarani [312] noticed that Shastry’s construction can
be generalized to the family of XX models. Shastry proceeded as follows.
(i) He constructed a higher conserved operator I2 of the Hubbard model, i.e., he constructed an operator which commutes with the Hubbard Hamiltonian.
(ii) By means of a Jordan-Wigner transformation he obtained ‘spin chain operators’, H (s) ,
I2(s) , related to the Hubbard Hamiltonian and the conserved operator I2 .
(iii) He guessed an L-matrix, such that the series of conserved operators generated by the
associated transfer matrix t(λ) started as
ln(U −1 t(λ)) = λH (s) + λ2 I2(s) + . . .
(iv) He constructed an R-matrix, such that his L-matrix appeared as the fundamental representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra deﬁned by that R-matrix.

418

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

We shall not repeat all steps of Shastry’s derivation here. What we are really interested
in is the R-matrix. We shall need it in the construction of a fermionic version of the YangBaxter algebra that is directly connected to the Hubbard model in the next sections and in
the construction of the thermodynamics of the Hubbard model within the so-called quantum
transfer matrix approach in Chapter 13. Shastry did not present an analytic proof that his
R-matrix satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation. Such proof was given later by Shiroishi and
Wadati [401]. Still, point (iv) above of Shastry’s argument is rather simple and beautiful. We
therefore reproduce it below. The technically more involved proof of Shiroishi and Wadati
is presented in appendix 12.A.
Let us deﬁne a matrix G(h) ∈ End(Cd ⊗ Cd ) by
)
*
G(h) = exp h C ↑ C ↓ /2 = ch(h/2) + C ↑ C ↓ sh(h/2) .
(12.106)
G(h) is acting on the auxiliary space of r (λ). Next we deﬁne matrices L j (λ) and L j (µ)
as
L j (λ) = G(h) j (λ)G(h) ,

L j (µ) = G(l) j (µ)G(l) .

(12.107)

It follows from (12.103) and (12.105) that

This equation takes the form of the deﬁning relations of a Yang-Baxter algebra if we can
ﬁnd coefﬁcients α, β, such that the terms in curly bracket on the left- and right-hand side
of this equation agree, i.e., we have to determine α and β such that

The latter equation is satisﬁed if and only if the terms in curly brackets both vanish. Thus

β

(12.108)

These are two algebraic equations. Using the addition theorems for trigonometric and
hyperbolic functions the second equation (12.108) is shown to be equivalent to
sh(2h)
sh(2l)
=
=u.
sin(2λ)
sin(2µ)

(12.109)

Here the parameter u is a free parameter which will turn out to be the coupling constant
of the Hubbard model. Equation (12.109) deﬁnes a function that expresses h in terms of
λ and u and l in terms of µ and u. In order to deﬁne this function uniquely we choose
the principal branch of the inverse sh-function. Then h(λ = 0) = l(µ = 0) = 0. The ﬁrst
equation (12.108) ﬁxes the ratio α/β as a function of λ, µ and u. Since only the ratio is ﬁxed,
β remains a free function. This, of course, is due to the homogeneity of the Yang-Baxter
algebra.
Let us summarize. We have found that the L-matrix (12.107) is a representation of the
Yang-Baxter algebra with R-matrix


Ř(λ, µ) = β G(l) ⊗ G(h)
,

-

× ř (λ − µ) + (α/β) ř (λ + µ) C ↑ C ↓ ⊗ Id 2 G(−h) ⊗ G(−l) (12.110)
provided that h and l are ﬁxed as functions of λ, µ and u by (12.109), and α/β is given
by (12.108). The matrix (12.110) is Shastry’s R-matrix in its generalized form obtained by
Maassarani. Our derivation was based on the properties (12.94) of the conjugation matrix
and on the decorated Yang-Baxter equation (12.98).
The R-matrix (12.110) is rather special in that it is not of difference form. The second
spectral parameter µ is a true independent parameter. For µ = 0 the R-matrix R(λ, µ) =
P Ř(λ, µ) takes its simplest form
R(λ, 0) =

β
(G(h) ⊗ Id 2 )r (λ)(G(h) ⊗ Id 2 ) .
ch(h)

(12.111)

According to our general formula (12.32) the associated L-matrix is
L j (λ, 0) =

G(h) j (λ)G(h) =

(12.112)

with L j (λ) from (12.107). This is an interesting result. Fixing either β to ch(h) in (12.112)
or changing the deﬁnition (12.107) we can interpret L j (λ) as a fundamental representation

420

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On the other hand, (12.112) also implies that R(λ, µ) satisﬁes
the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21) for ν = 0.
In fact, the R-matrix (12.110) satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21) for all λ, µ and
ν. For the case d = 2, which corresponds to the Hubbard model, this can, for instance, be
shown with the aid of some computer algebra [391]. For general d a deeper understanding
of the algebraic properties of the XX models is necessary. The decorated Yang-Baxter
equation (12.98) is part of a whole algebra of similar relations. It is this so-called tetrahedral
Zamolodchikov algebra that will be used in appendix 12.A to prove that R(λ, µ) satisﬁes
the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21) also for ν = 0.
The ratio α/β, equation (12.108) vanishes for µ = λ. It follows that
Ř(λ, λ) = β(λ, λ) · id .

(12.113)

Thus R(λ, µ) is regular for an appropriate choice of the function β(λ, µ) which is not ﬁxed
by (12.108). We further infer from the unitarity of the XX model R-matrix and from the
fact that [ř (λ − µ), ř (λ + µ)] = 0 that
Ř(λ, µ) Ř(µ, λ) = β(λ, µ)β(µ, λ)


× cos2 (λ − µ) cos2 (λ − µ) − cos2 (λ + µ)th2 (h − l) .

(12.114)

Thus Ř(λ, µ) becomes unitary for either of the two choices
β(λ, µ) =

-−1
ch(h − l) ,
cos(λ − µ)ch(h − l) ± cos(λ + µ)sh(h − l)
.
cos(λ − µ)

(12.115)

Unless otherwise stated we assume in the following that β(λ, µ) is given by (12.115) with
the plus sign. With this choice of β(λ, µ) we have β(λ, λ) = 1, and R(λ, µ) is also regular.
For the interpretation of the fundamental model generated by Ř(λ, µ) we still have to
derive the Hamiltonian in the homogeneous case. We shall restrict ourselves to µ = 0.
Then

which is Shastry’s original spin Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is, up to a twist of the
boundary conditions, equivalent to the Hubbard Hamiltonian by a Jordan-Wigner transformation [393]. The case of general µ for d = 2 and the inhomogeneous vertex model were
discussed in [401].
12.2.4 Explicit form of the R-matrix (d = 2)
The R-matrix (12.110) with d = 2 is called Shastry’s R-matrix. It is related to the Hubbard
model. Later, when we construct the algebraic Bethe ansatz, and also in Chapter 15 where
we algebraically construct the eigenstates on the inﬁnite interval, we shall need its explicit
form. Recall that the R-matrix (12.110) is a d 4 × d 4 -matrix. Thus, for d = 2 its dimension is
16 × 16. In order to obtain its explicit form we insert the R-matrix (12.93) of the su(2)-XX
model, the conjugation matrix (12.95), and the expressions (12.108) for α/β and (12.115)
for β into equation (12.110),

The R-matrix (12.120) is constructed from two independent copies of the XX-model Rmatrix. In principle, each of these copies carries one more free parameter (the parameter x

in (12.92)). Yet, the two ‘twist parameters’, say x and y, that come with the representations
Q of the free fermion algebra may be set equal to unity, since the dependence of Ř(λ, µ)
on x and y can be restored by a so-called twist transformation, to be discussed in the next
subsection.
Following the terminology of statistical mechanics we shall call the functions ρ j =

The Yang-Baxter equation is invariant under various kinds of transformations. We exhibit
three simple lemmata that will be needed for our further considerations. In what follows
we shall always assume that Ř(λ, µ) ∈ End(Cn ⊗ Cn ) is a solution of the Yang-Baxter
equation (12.30).

Then V Ř(λ, µ)V −1 is a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.30).
Let us consider the important special case of V being a diagonal matrix. Then (12.126)

for X = A, B, C, D. On the other hand, Shastry’s R-matrix (12.120) has the following
property [178]: let α, β, γ , δ ∈ C. Then
[ Ř(λ, µ), diag(α, β, γ , δ) ⊗ diag(α, β, γ , δ)] = 0

⇔

αδ = βγ .

(12.132)

This means that (12.127) is satisﬁed if and only if
x1 x4 = x2 x3

for x = a, b, c, d ,

ajdj = bjcj

for j = 1, 2, 3, 4 .

(12.133)

In general, our considerations allow us to introduce additional parameters into the Rmatrix which may appear as additional coupling constants in the Hamiltonian [280]. Here
we do not work out the consequences of general diagonal twists, but rather give two simple
but important examples. First of all, the matrix
V = diag(1, −1, −1, 1|1, −1, −1, 1|1, 1, 1, 1|1, 1, 1, 1)

(12.134)

obviously satisﬁes (12.133). Thus, we have shown that
V Ř(λ, µ)V −1 =

The corresponding R-matrix VOWA ŘVOWA
Wadati and Akutsu [349].

12.3 Graded quantum inverse scattering method
In Section 12.1 we encountered so-called fundamental models. They were constructed by
attaching the operators e j βα , equation (12.23), to a solution R(λ, µ) of the Yang-Baxter
equation. For a lack of any better name, we henceforth call them ‘local projection operators’. The local projection operators were used as local quantum space operators. They are
characterized by two properties: the ‘projection property’ (12.24) and their commutativity
(12.25).
We shall now introduce Fermi operators into the formalism. We shall proceed slightly
indirectly. Clearly, models containing fermions cannot be fundamental models of the kind
presented in Section 12.1, since all local quantum space operators constructed from local
projection operators e j βα , equation 12.23, commute for different site indices. In order to
introduce fermions we therefore seek for a generalization of the local projection operators,
such that they still satisfy (12.24), but commute or anticommute depending on the values
of their ‘matrix indices’ α, β. Such kind of construction requires the introduction of graded
vector spaces and graded algebras. Accordingly, the modiﬁed operators e j βα will be called
‘graded local projection operators’.
With the aid of graded local projection operators we can construct fundamental graded
models in much the same way as in Section 12.1, namely, by appropriately attaching graded
local projection operators to a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. This works for all Rmatrices that satisfy a rather weak compatibility condition due to Kulish and Sklyanin [276].
Fermi operators come into the play by the observation that the graded local projection
operators are matrix representations of fermionic projection operators. The transformation
from fermionic projection operators to graded local projection operators can be interpreted
as a generalization of the Jordan-Wigner transformation [227] to fermions with an arbitrary
number of internal degrees of freedom (su(n) fermions). In fact, for spinless fermions the
Jordan-Wigner transformation is recovered. The material developed below is taken from
the articles [177, 179].

12.3.1 Graded vector spaces
In this subsection we shall recall the basic concepts of graded vector spaces and graded
associative algebras. In the context of the quantum inverse scattering method these concepts

426

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

were ﬁrst used by Kulish and Sklyanin [272, 276]. We shall further recall the notions
of ‘graded local projection operators’ and graded transposition operators. Graded local
projection operators were introduced in the article [179]. They enable the deﬁnition of
fundamental graded representations of the Yang-Baxter algebra, which will be given in the
following subsection.
Graded vector spaces are vector spaces equipped with a notion of odd and even, that
allows us to treat fermions within the formalism of the quantum inverse scattering method.
Let us start with a ﬁnite dimensional local space of states V , on which we impose an additional structure, the parity, from the outset. Let V = V0 ⊕ V1 , dim V0 = m, dim V1 = n. We
shall call v0 ∈ V0 even and v1 ∈ V1 odd. The subspaces V0 and V1 are called the homogeneous components of V . The parity p is a function Vi → Z2 deﬁned on the homogeneous
components of V ,
p(vi ) = i ,

i = 0, 1 ,

vi ∈ Vi .

(12.137)

The vector space V endowed with this structure is called a graded vector space or
super space. Let us ﬁx a basis {e1 , . . . , em+n } of deﬁnite parity and let us deﬁne
p(α) := p(eα ).
In order to introduce Fermi operators into the formalism of the quantum inverse scattering
method we have to construct an algebra of commuting and anticommuting operators. For
this purpose the concept of parity must be extended to operators in End(V ) and to tensor
products of these operators. Let eαβ ∈ End(V ), eαβ eγ = δγβ eα . The set {eαβ ∈ End(V )|α, β =
1, . . . m + n} is a basis of End(V ). Hence, the deﬁnition
p(eαβ ) = p(α) + p(β)

(12.138)

induces a grading on End(V ) regarded as a vector space.
It is easy to see that an element A = Aαβ eαβ ∈ End(V ) is homogeneous with parity p(A),
if and only if
(−1) p(α)+ p(β) Aαβ = (−1) p(A) Aαβ .

(12.139)

The latter equation implies for two homogeneous elements A, B ∈ End(V ) that their product
AB is homogeneous with parity
p(AB) = p(A) + p(B) .

(12.140)

In other words, multiplication of matrices in End(V ) preserves homogeneity, and therefore,
End(V ) endowed with the grading (12.138) is a graded associative algebra [276].
Let us consider the L-fold tensorial power H = (End(V ))⊗L of End(V ). The deﬁnition
(12.138) has a natural extension to H, namely,
p(eαβ11 ⊗ · · · ⊗ eαβLL ) = p(α1 ) + p(β1 ) + · · · + p(α L ) + p(β L ) .

(12.141)

From this formula it can be seen in a similar way as before, that homogeneous elements

A = Aαβ11 ...β

(12.142)

which generalizes (12.139). Again the product AB is homogeneous with parity p(AB) =
p(A) + p(B), if A and B are homogeneous. Thus the deﬁnition (12.141) induces the structure of a graded associative algebra on H.
Let us deﬁne the super-bracket
[X, Y ]± = X Y − (−1) p(X ) p(Y ) Y X

(12.143)

for X , Y taken from the homogeneous components of End(V ), and let us extend it linearly
to End(V ) in both of its arguments. Then, End(V ) endowed with the super-bracket becomes
the Lie-super algebra gl(m|n). Note that the above deﬁnition of a super-bracket makes sense
in any graded algebra and is particularly valid in H.
The following deﬁnition of ‘graded local projection operators’ [179] will be crucial for
our deﬁnition of fundamental graded representations of the Yang-Baxter algebra in the next
subsection. Deﬁne the matrices

where Im+n is the (m + n) × (m + n) unit matrix, and summation over double tensor indices
(i.e., over γ j+1 , . . . , γ L ) is understood. We shall keep this sum convention throughout the
remainder of this chapter. The index j on the left hand side of (12.144) will later refer to
the jth site of a physical lattice model and is called the site index. A simple consequence
of the deﬁnition (12.144) for j = k are the commutation relations
e j βα ek δγ = (−1)( p(α)+ p(β))( p(γ )+ p(δ)) ek δγ e j βα .

(12.145)

It further follows from equation (12.144) that e j βα is homogeneous with parity
p(e j βα ) = p(α) + p(β) .

(12.146)

Hence, in agreement with intuition, equation (12.145) says that odd matrices with different
site indices mutually anticommute, whereas even matrices commute with each other as well
as with the odd matrices. For products of matrices e j βα which act on the same site (12.144)
implies the projection property
e j βα e j δγ = δγβ e j δα .

(12.147)

Equations (12.145) and (12.147) justify our terminology. The e j βα are graded analogues
of local projection operators. We call them graded local projection operators or projection
operators, for short. Using the super-bracket (12.143), equations (12.145) and (12.147) can
be combined into

[e j βα , ek δγ ]± = δ jk δγβ e j δα − (−1)( p(α)+ p(β))( p(γ )+ p(δ)) δαδ e j βγ .
(12.148)
The right-hand side of the latter equation with j = k gives the structure constants of the
Lie super algebra gl(m|n) with respect to the basis {e j βα }.

428

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

Since any m + n-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers is isomorphic
to Cm+n , we may simply set V = Cm+n . We may further assume that our homogeneous
basis {eα ∈ Cm+n |α = 1, . . . , m + n} is canonical, i.e., we may represent the vector eα by a
column vector having the only non-zero entry +1 in row α. Our basic matrices eαβ are then
(m + n) × (m + n)-matrices with a single non-zero entry +1 in row α and column β, and
we recover (12.23) from (12.144) for m = d and n = 0.
Remark. The meaning of (12.144) becomes more evident by considering a simple example.
Let m = n = 1 and p(1) = 0, p(2) = 1. Then, using (12.148), we obtain
[e j 21 , ek 21 ]± = {e j 21 , ek 21 } = 0 ,

(12.149)

[e j 12 , ek 12 ]± = {e j 12 , ek 12 } = 0 ,
[e j 21 , ek 12 ]± = {e j 12 , ek 21 } = δ jk (e j 11 + e j 22 ) = δ jk

(12.150)
(12.151)

for j, k = 1, . . . , L. The curly brackets in (12.149), (12.150) denote the anticommutator.
The matrices e j 21 and ek 12 satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations for spinless Fermi
†
operators. We can therefore identify e j 21 → c j and ek 12 → ck . Introducing Pauli matrices
σ + = e12 , σ − = e21 and σ z = e11 − e22 we obtain, by carrying out the summation, the following explicit matrix representation from our basic deﬁnition (12.144):
⊗( j−1)

⊗ σ + ⊗ (σ z )⊗(L− j) ,

(12.152)

ck = I2⊗(k−1) ⊗ σ − ⊗ (σ z )⊗(L−k) .

(12.153)

c j = I2
†

This is the well-known Jordan-Wigner transformation [227] expressing Fermi operators for
spinless fermions in terms of Pauli matrices. We may thus interpret equation (12.144) as a
generalization of the Jordan-Wigner transformation. In general, equation (12.144) provides
matrix representations not of Fermi operators but, more generally, of fermionic projection
operators. Representations of Fermi operators can be obtained be taking appropriate linear
combinations of matrices e j βα . This issue will be explained below.
The transposition operator plays an important role in the construction of local integrable
lattice models. It enters the expression for the shift operator on homogeneous lattices. In the
graded case the deﬁnition of the transposition operator requires the following modiﬁcation
of signs,
P jk = (−1) p(β) e j βα ek αβ .

(12.154)

As indicated by its name, this operator induces the action of the symmetric group S L on
the site indices of the matrices e j βα . The properties of P jk (for j = k) are the same as in the
non-graded case (see (12.28)). They are easily derived from (12.145) and (12.147).
In the next subsection the graded associative algebra H will be considered as the space
of states of a lattice model associated with a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We will
deﬁne a monodromy matrix whose entries are elements of H. The following deﬁnitions
will prove to be useful.

12.3 Graded quantum inverse scattering method

429

Consider (m + n) × (m + n)-matrices A, B, C, . . . with entries in H, such that p(Aαβ ) =
p(Bβα ) = p(Cβα ) = · · · = p(α) + p(β) for α, β = 1, . . . , m + n. These matrices form an
associative algebra, say A, since p(Aαβ Bγβ ) = p(α) + p(γ ). For A, B ∈ A deﬁne a super
tensor product (or graded tensor product)

γ

(A ⊗s B)βδ = (−1)( p(α)+ p(β)) p(γ ) Aαβ Bδ .

(12.155)

This deﬁnition has an interesting consequence. Let A, B, C, D ∈ A, such that
γ

[Bβα , Cδ ]± = 0 .

(12.156)

(A ⊗s B)(C ⊗s D) = AC ⊗s B D .

(12.157)

Then

For later use we further deﬁne the super trace of a matrix A ∈ A by
str(A) = (−1) p(α) Aαα .

(12.158)

12.3.2 Fundamental graded models
In this subsection we shall introduce the notion of fundamental graded representations of
the Yang-Baxter algebra [179]. For a given grading we shall associate a fundamental model
with every solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31) that satisﬁes the compatibility
condition of Kulish and Sklyanin [276],
αβ

αβ

Rγ δ (λ, µ) = (−1) p(α)+ p(β)+ p(γ )+ p(δ) Rγ δ (λ, µ) .

(12.159)

This compatibility condition simply means that certain matrix elements vanish. For Rmatrices satisfying (12.159) we deﬁne a graded L-matrix at site j,
αγ

L j αβ (λ, µ) = (−1) p(α) p(γ ) Rβδ (λ, µ)e j δγ .

(12.160)

Its properties are summarized in the following.

(i) Homogeneity. The matrix elements of the graded L-matrix are homogeneous with parity


p L j αβ (λ, µ) = p(α) + p(β) .

(12.161)

(ii) Commutativity. The entries of the graded L-matrix super commute for different site
indices,

[L j αβ (λ, µ), Lk δ (ν, ρ)]± = 0 ,

(12.162)

for j = k.

bilinear relation

αβ

where, as in the non-graded case (12.17), the matrix Ř(λ, µ) is deﬁned by Řγ δ (λ, µ) =
βα
Rγ δ (λ, µ).
The lemma follows from the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31) and from equation (12.159).
Equation (12.163) may be interpreted as deﬁning a graded Yang-Baxter algebra with Rmatrix Ř(λ, µ). We call L j (λ, µ) its fundamental graded representation.
Starting from (12.163) we can construct integrable lattice models as in the non-graded case
(see Section 12.1.5). Let us brieﬂy recall the construction with emphasis on the modiﬁcations
that appear due to the grading. Deﬁne a monodromy matrix T (λ) as an L-fold ordered
product of fundamental L-matrices,
T (λ) = L L (λ, ν L ) . . . L1 (λ, ν1 ) .

(12.164)

Due to equation (12.140) the matrix elements of T (λ) are homogeneous with parity
p(Tβα (λ)) = p(α) + p(β). Repeated application of (12.163) and (12.157) shows that this
monodromy matrix is a representation of the graded Yang-Baxter algebra,

 

Ř(λ, µ) T (λ) ⊗s T (µ) = T (µ) ⊗s T (λ) Ř(λ, µ) .
(12.165)
It follows from (12.159) and (12.165) that
,
str(T (λ)), str(T (µ)) = 0 ,

(12.166)

which is in complete analogy with the non-graded case. We see that the transfer matrix is
now given by t(λ) = str(T (λ)).
The construction of a local lattice Hamiltonian as well is very similar to the non-graded
αβ
case. Suppose that R(λ, µ) is a regular solution of the Yang-Baxter equation, Rγ δ (λ0 , ν0 ) =
δδα δγβ for some λ0 , ν0 ∈ C. Then (12.160) implies that
L j αβ (λ0 , ν0 ) = (−1) p(α) p(β) e j αβ ,

(12.167)

and we can see (compare (12.154)) as in the non-graded case that we obtain the right-shift
operator for ν1 = · · · = ν L = ν0 and λ = λ0 ,
t(λ0 ) = P12 P23 . . . PL−1L = Û .

(12.168)

It follows that τ (λ) = ln(Û −1 t(λ)) generates a sequence of local operators [308],


τ (λ) = (λ − λ0 )Û −1 t  (λ0 ) + O (λ − λ0 )2 ,
(12.169)
which, as a consequence of (12.166), mutually commute. As expected, the local terms

12.3 Graded quantum inverse scattering method

431

We would like to emphasize the following points. (i) The R-matrix Ř(λ, µ) in equation
(12.163) does not undergo a modiﬁcation due to the grading. (ii) The only necessary compatibility condition which has to be satisﬁed in order to introduce a fundamental graded
representation of the Yang-Baxter algebra associated with a solution of the Yang-Baxter
equation is equation (12.159), which was introduced in [276].
The role of the matrix Ř(λ, µ) in the graded Yang-Baxter algebra (12.163) is to switch
the order of the two auxiliary spaces. The deﬁnition of an operator that similarly switches
the order of quantum spaces in a product of two L-matrices requires appropriate use of the
grading. Such an operator was introduced for several important models in [99,466,467] and
was called fermionic R-operator. A general deﬁnition of the fermionic R-operator associated
with a solution R(λ, µ) of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31) was obtained in [177]. For a
given grading and a solution R(λ, µ) of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31) that is compatible
with this grading (see (12.159)) we deﬁne (following [177]) the fermionic R-operator
αβ

R jk (λ, µ) = (−1) p(γ )+ p(α)( p(β)+ p(γ )) Rγ δ (λ, µ)e j γα ek δβ .
f

(12.172)

Let us summarize its properties in the following
Lemma 14. Properties of the fermionic R-operator.
(i) Evenness. The fermionic R-operator is even,
f

p(R jk (λ, µ)) = 0 .

(12.173)

(ii) Bilinear relation. The fermionic R-operator satisﬁes

(iii) Yang-Baxter equation. The fermionic R-operator satisﬁes the following form of the
Yang-Baxter equation,
f

(12.175)

αβ

(iv) Regularity. If R(λ, µ) is regular, say Rγ δ (λ0 , ν0 ) = δδα δγβ , then
f

R jk (λ0 , ν0 ) = P jk ,

(12.176)

where P jk is the graded permutation operator (12.154).
(v) Unitarity. If R(λ, µ) is unitary, i.e., if
δγ

αβ

β

Rγ δ (λ, µ)Rα β  (µ, λ) = δβα δα ,

(12.177)

f

then R jk (λ, µ) is unitary in the sense that
f

f

R jk (λ, µ)Rk j (µ, λ) = id .

(12.178)

The fermionic R-operator has at least three interesting applications. First of all, we shall
need it below to prove an inversion theorem [177] that allows us to express the graded
local projection operators e j βα in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix (12.164).
Second, the form (12.175) of the Yang-Baxter equation is sometimes more convenient for

432

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

the construction of generic fermionic models. We shall illustrate this point below with an
example. Finally, it is possible to deﬁne a ‘monodromy operator’ [466, 467] and to use
(12.175) as a starting point for an algebraic Bethe ansatz. For this purpose one has to
introduce two fermionic auxiliary sites, say a and b, and has to deﬁne
f

f

Ta f (λ) = R a,L (λ, ν L ) . . . R a,1 (λ, ν1 ) .

(12.179)

Then
f

f

f

f

R ab (λ, µ)Ta f (λ)Tb (µ) = Tb (µ)Ta f (λ)R ab (λ, µ) .

(12.180)

The monodromy operator is connected to the monodromy matrix (12.164) by the formula
Ta f (λ) = (−1) p(β)+ p(α) p(β) ea βα Tβα (λ) .

(12.181)

12.3.3 Global symmetries from local symmetries
Symmetries of fundamental models solvable by the quantum inverse scattering method
are most naturally understood in terms of the symmetries of the corresponding R-matrix.
Some of the readers may be familiar with the ‘non-graded’ case: Suppose an R-matrix
R(λ, µ) ∈ End(Cd ⊗ Cd ) satisﬁes
[R(λ, µ), x ⊗ Id + Id ⊗ x] = 0

(12.182)

for some x = xβα eαβ ∈ gl(d) and for all λ, µ ∈ C. Then the transfer matrix of the corresponding inhomogeneous model commutes with
X=

xβα e j βα =

xj .

(12.183)

j=1

We are familiar with such kind of symmetry from our proof of the spin-su(2) symmetry of
the Hubbard model in Section (3.D).
A natural starting point for a generalization to the graded case is the invariance equation
f

[R12 (λ, µ), x1 + x2 ] = 0

(12.184)

for the fermionic R-operator, which turns into (12.182) in the non-graded case. Here we
f
assume that R12 (λ, µ) is constructed from a given solution of the Yang-Baxter equation
(12.31) compatible with some grading p : {1, . . . , m + n} → Z2 . We shall further assume
that x = xβα eαβ is homogeneous with parity p(x) in gl(m|n). Inserting the deﬁnition (12.172)
of the fermionic R-operator into (12.184) and comparing the coefﬁcients in front of e1 βα e2 δγ

(12.159) to rearrange the minus signs in (12.185). Equation (12.185) is the basic invariance
equation for the R-matrix that replaces (12.182) in the graded case and obviously turns into
(12.182) when the grading is trivial. The corresponding equation for the L-matrix is

and is obtained from (12.185) by multiplication by e j δγ . A simple induction argument leads
from (12.186) to the invariance equation

for the monodromy matrix. Again X = x1 + · · · + x L . Using the deﬁnition (12.143) of the
super-bracket equation (12.187) can be equivalently written as

The latter equation is useful for studying the highest weight properties of states within the
algebraic Bethe ansatz. Multiplying (12.188) by (−1) p(α) , setting β = α, and summing over
α we conclude that
,
str(T (λ)), X = 0 .
(12.189)
In many cases the symmetry of the R-matrix is evident by construction, e.g., when the
R-matrix is an intertwiner of representations of quantum groups. Yet there are examples, as
Shastry’s R-matrix of the Hubbard model, where the symmetries are less obvious. Moreover, as can be seen from the above derivation, the symmetries of the transfer matrix are
determined by the symmetries of R̃ rather than R and therefore depend on the choice of the
grading.
It may be argued that, in the presence of a grading, the matrix R̃ is more fundamental
than R, since R̃ determines the L-matrix (12.160), the symmetries of the model and (if it
exists) the semi-classical limit [276]. Substituting R̃ into the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31),
we obtain the so-called graded Yang-Baxter equation, which equivalently might have been
taken as the starting point of our section on the graded Yang-Baxter algebra. Since it is
the non-graded matrix Ř, however, which ﬁxes the structure of the Yang-Baxter algebra,
equation (12.163), we did not adopt this point of view.

12.3.4 Fermi operators
Let us now explain how the various graded objects introduced in the previous subsections can be expressed in terms of Fermi operators. The key observation is that, as far as
the matrices e j βα are concerned, all calculations of the previous subsections solely rely on
the commutation relations (12.145) and on the projection property (12.147). Fermionic
projection operators satisfy the same equations. We may thus say that the matrices e j βα

434

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

are matrix representations of fermionic projection operators. As we have seen, the matrices e j βα are suitable for formulating a graded version of the quantum inverse scattering
method. For the physical interpretation of a Hamiltonian constructed from a given solution
of the Yang-Baxter equation, however, it is useful to introduce Fermi operators into the
formalism.
To begin with, let us consider spinless fermions on a ring of L lattice sites,
†

†

{c j , ck } = {c j , ck } = 0 ,

†

{c j , ck } = δ jk ,

j, k = 1, . . . , L .

(12.190)

It is easy to verify that the entries (X j )αβ of the matrix


1 − nj
Xj =
†


(12.191)

are fermionic projection operators: deﬁne X j βα = (X j )αβ ; then
X j βα X j δγ = δγβ X j δα .

(12.192)

The operators X j βα carry parity, induced by the anti-commutation rule (12.190) for the
Fermi operators. For j = k X j βα and X k δγ anticommute, if both are built up of an odd
number of Fermi operators, and otherwise commute. This fact can be expressed as follows.
Let p(1) = 0, p(2) = 1 and p(X j βα ) = p(α) + p(β). Then X j βα is odd (contains an odd
number of Fermi operators), if p(X j βα ) = 1, and even, if p(X j βα ) = 0. The commutation
rules for the projectors X j βα are thus
X j βα X k δγ = (−1)( p(α)+ p(β))( p(γ )+ p(δ)) X k δγ X j βα .

(12.193)

Now (12.192) and (12.193) are of the same form as (12.147) and (12.145), respectively.
Since the calculations in the previous section relied solely on (12.145) and (12.147), we
may simply replace e j βα → X j βα in equations (12.160) and (12.171).
Fermionic representations compatible with an arbitrary grading can be constructed by
considering several species of fermions and graded products of projection operators. We
shall explain this for the case of two species ﬁrst. This is the most interesting case in
applications, since we may interpret the two species as up- and down-spin electrons. We
†
have to attach a spin index to the Fermi operators, c j → c jσ , σ =↑, ↓, {c jσ , ckτ } = δ jk δσ τ .
Accordingly, there are two species of projection operators, X j βα → X σj βα .
Let us deﬁne projection operators for electrons by the tensor products

Here we used the standard ordering of matrix elements of tensor products, corresponding to
a renumbering (11) → 1, (12) → 2, (21) → 3, (22) → 4. Within this convention X j βδ
αγ is
β
replaced by X j α , α, β = 1, . . . , 4, which then satisﬁes (12.192) and (12.193) with grading
p(1) = p(4) = 0, p(2) = p(3) = 1.
Note that Fermi operators can be recovered as linear combinations of projection operators.
By inspection of equation (12.196) we obtain
c j↑ = X j 12 + X j 34 ,

†

c j↑ = X j 21 + X j 43 ,

c j↓ = X j 31 − X j 42 .

c j,↓ = e j 13 − e j 24 = I2
c j,↑ = e j 21 + e j 43 = I2
c j,↓ = e j 31 − e j 42 = I2

This is , of course, a familiar generalization of the Jordan-Wigner transformation to Fermions
with spin degrees of freedom.
So far we have considered the case of spinless fermions with two-dimensional local
space of states and grading m = n = 1, and the case of electrons with four-dimensional
space of states and grading m = n = 2. There are four different possibilities to realize
(12.145) and (12.147) in the case of a three-dimensional local space of states, m + n = 3.
They can be obtained by deleting the α’s row and column of the matrix X j in equation

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

(12.196), α = 1, 2, 3, 4. (12.192) and (12.193) remain valid, since the operators X j βα are
projectors.
It should be clear by now how to generalize the above considerations to an arbitrary
number of species of fermions. In the case of N species we may deﬁne

which can be shown by induction over the number of species. Here the grading is m =
n = 2 N −1 . The most general case is obtained deleting rows and columns from X j , equation
(12.202), in analogy with the example considered above.
Let us note that the operators X j βα for two species of fermions appear under the name
Hubbard projection operators in the literature.
Remark. An alternative way [92,349,367] of introducing Fermi operators into the quantum
inverse scattering method is by applying a (generalized) Jordan-Wigner transformation as
formulated for creation and annihilation operators [92] to the non-graded L-matrix and then
pulling out the non-local factors. This approach was of primary importance, for instance,
for a fermionic formulation of the Yang-Baxter algebra of the Hubbard model [349] and
led to the discovery of a SO(4)-invariant form of the monodromy matrix of the Hubbard model [178, 349, 399]. Still, we prefer the method presented above for conceptual clarity. The approach of [92, 349, 367] so far has not led to general formulae such
as (12.160) or (12.171) and does not enable us to control the boundary conditions, which
lead in turns to unwanted twists and to the appearance of numerous factors of ‘i’ in the
equations.

12.3.5 Examples
A few simple examples will make us more familiar with the formalism developed so
far. The simplest non-trivial example we can offer is the su(2)-XX model with Rmatrix (12.93) and grading p(1) = 0, p(2) = 1. This choice of the grading is compatible
with the R-matrix (see (12.159)). The corresponding local Hamiltonian is obtained from
equation (12.171),
H j−1, j = x −1 e j−1 12 e j 21 − x e j−1 21 e j 12 .

(12.205)

We may use the projection operators X j βα deﬁned in the line below (12.191) to express
H j−1, j in terms of Fermi operators. Specializing the free parameter x in (12.93) to x = −1,

we obtain

H =−

which is the Hamiltonian of the spinless tight-binding model. The corresponding L-matrix
follows from the deﬁnition (12.160). It is of the form L j (λ, µ) = L j (λ − µ) with

and satisﬁes the bilinear relation (12.163) with R-matrix (12.93) and x = −1. The algebraic
Bethe ansatz for this model is left as an exercise to the reader.
The next example in this line is generated by the R-matrix of the su(3)-XX model, i.e., by
the R-matrix (12.92) with d = 3. This R-matrix is compatible with the grading p(1) = 0,
p(2) = p(3) = 1. Our general formula (12.171) yields the expression

(12.208)
for the Hamiltonian density in terms of the graded local projection operators e j βα . We are free
to fermionize it in different ways. We may, for instance, use the set of fermionic projection
operators obtained from the matrix X j in (12.196) by deleting the fourth row and column.

of the Hamiltonian. We identify it as the t-0 Hamiltonian encountered earlier in appendix
2.A as an effective strong coupling approximation to the Hubbard Hamiltonian below halfﬁlling. The L-matrix (12.160) that generates the t-0 model as a fundamental graded model
is of the form L j (λ, µ) = L j (λ − µ) with

(12.214)

This L-matrix can be used as a starting point for an algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the
t-0 model (see [179]).
Our last example in this section is a family of R-matrices closely related to the XXX
models considered in Section 12.1.6. We observed that the graded transposition operator
(12.154) shares the properties (12.28) (except for (12.28b)) with its non-graded counterpart. In particular, setting Ai = Pi,i+1 , we see that the graded transposition operators form a representation of the group algebra of the symmetric group (12.44). Let us
deﬁne
f

R jk (λ, µ) = c(λ − µ) + b(λ − µ)P jk

(12.215)

f

with b(λ) and c(λ) taken from (12.48). Then, by (12.45), R jk (λ, µ) satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter
f

equation in the form (12.175). Since c(0) = 0 and b(0) = 1, we conclude that R jk (λ, λ) =
P jk and thus is regular in the sense of (12.176). It is moreover unitary in the sense of
f
(12.178). Hence R jk (λ, µ) may be interpreted as the fermionic R-operator of a model to
be identiﬁed. Rewriting it as
R jk (λ, µ) = c(λ − µ) + b(λ − µ)(−1) p(β) e j βα ek αβ
,
β
= c(λ − µ)δγα δδ + b(λ − µ)(−1) p(γ ) δδα δγβ e j γα ek δβ

,
β
× c(λ − µ)(−1) p(α) p(β) δγα δδ + b(λ − µ)δδα δγβ e j γα ek δβ

(12.216)

we can compare it with the deﬁnition (12.172) of the fermionic R-operator. It follows that
the term in square brackets,
αβ

β

Rγ δ (λ, µ) = c(λ − µ)(−1) p(α) p(β) δγα δδ + b(λ − µ)δδα δγβ ,
satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31).

(12.217)

12.3 Graded quantum inverse scattering method

439

Our example shows that the fermionic R-operator is a useful tool for the construction
of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. The peculiar feature of the family (12.217) of
solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation is its dependence on a grading. In fact, by construction,
(12.217) satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation for arbitrary grading p : {1, . . . m + n} → Z2 .
It is therefore natural to call such kind of solutions graded R-matrices. The family (12.217)
of rational graded R-matrices is in Kulish and Sklyanin’s early list [276] of known solutions
of the Yang-Baxter equation.
We may now associate a fundamental graded model with the solution (12.217) of the
Yang-Baxter equation. As we have learned the ﬁrst step then is to choose a grading which
is compatible with the R-matrix. Note that this grading need not be identical with the
grading which enters the deﬁnition of the R-matrix. Let us choose an arbitrary grading
q : {1, . . . , m + n} → Z2 . Then, because of the Kronecker deltas in (12.217),
αβ

αβ

Rγ δ (λ, µ) = (−1)q(α)+q(β)+q(γ )+q(δ) Rγ δ (λ, µ) ,

(12.218)

i.e., the compatibility condition (12.159) is satisﬁed for arbitrary p and q.
Let us elaborate on the case p = q. Since c(0) = 0 and b(0) = 1, the R-matrix (12.217)
is regular. Furthermore,
αβ

(12.220)

j=1

of the homogeneous, fundamental graded model associated with the R-matrix (12.217).
Here P j, j+1 is the graded transposition operator (12.154).
The family (12.220) of Hamiltonians based on graded permutations includes a number
of models that are interesting for applications in physics. In the ‘non-graded’ case n = 0
we recover the XXX models considered in Section 12.1.6. The case m = n = 1 provides
another realization of the tight-binding model of spinless Fermions. For m = n = 2 we
obtain the so-called EKS model [126, 127]. Here we shall have a closer look only at the
case m = 1, n = 2 which leads to the supersymmetric t-J model.
In order to see this we employ the same fermionization scheme as above where we
considered the su(3)-XX model, i.e., we replace the graded local projection operators e j βα
with the fermionic projection operators X j βα taken from (12.209). The summation in (12.154)
is again over three values, α, β = 1, 2, 3, and the grading is p(1) = 0, p(2) = p(3) = 1.
An elegant way of taking into account the simpliﬁcations arising from the restriction to the
Hilbert space of electrons with no double occupancy is by considering P jk P0 with P0 from
(12.211) instead of P jk . Since n j,↑ n j,↓ P0 = 0, we obtain
†

†

(P jk − 1)P0 = P0 (c ja cka + cka c ja )P0 − 2(S αj Skα − 14 n j n k )P0 − (n j + n k )P0 . (12.221)

440

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

Here we have denoted the density of electrons by n j = n j,↑ + n j,↓ and the spin densities by
α †
S αj = 12 σab
c ja c jb . Comparing (12.221) with (2.A.39) we see that we have indeed generated
the local Hamiltonian of the supersymmetric t-J model. Let us ﬁnally write down the
corresponding L-matrix, which follows from equation (12.160):

 1

This L-matrix can be used to perform an algebraic Bethe ansatz for the supersymmetric t-J
model which was originally obtained in [119, 138, 272] (for the algebraic Bethe ansatz of
the corresponding generalized model see [170, 181]).
At this point it becomes also evident, why the model is called supersymmetric t-J
model. Being a sum over transposition operators (see (12.220)) the Hamiltonian obviously
commutes with the generators
E βα =

α, β = 1, 2, 3, of the Lie superalgebra gl(1|2). This symmetry is a consequence of the
gl(1|2) invariance of the transfer matrix, which follows from the fact that the fermionic
R-operator (12.215) commutes with X j αβ + X k αβ (see Section 12.3.3).
12.4 The Hubbard model as a fundamental graded model
We are now going to show that the Hubbard model can be interpreted as a fundamental
graded model. This is an important fact. It means that the general theory developed in
the previous section can be applied. Furthermore, in the next section it will allow us to
re-express the local Fermi operators in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix.
We would like to emphasize that the choice of the appropriate R-matrix turns out to be
crucial for our considerations. This appropriate R-matrix is not Shastry’s original R-matrix
(12.120) but our modiﬁed version (12.135).
Due to various subtleties the history of the fermionic formulation of the Yang-Baxter
algebra connected with the Hubbard model is slightly involved. The pioneering work was
done by Wadati, Olmedilla and Akutsu [347, 349, 475]. Their work basically contains everything what is necessary to discuss the symmetries and to perform an algebraic Bethe
ansatz [320,371]. The main difference to our account here is of conceptional nature. Similar
to Shastry in his work on the spin model, Wadati, Olmedilla and Akutsu did not derive the
L-matrix from the R-matrix but obtained L-matrix and R-matrix simultaneously. This way
it was impossible to control the possible twists compatible with the Yang-Baxter equation
(see lemma 12 and below). Consequentially, the supertrace of the monodromy matrix evaluated at spectral parameter equal to zero did not give the shift operator but the shift operator
multiplied by a global gauge transformation [178]. Another disadvantage of the original

12.4 The Hubbard model as a fundamental graded model

441

approach of Wadati et al. is that it does allows one to treat neither the inhomogeneous
model nor the homogeneous model with the second spectral parameter µ different from
zero [401]. The latter case is of interest for models with R-matrix not of difference form,
since it may happen that the second spectral parameter generates an additional non-trivial
interaction in the Hamiltonian. The disadvantages of the approach of Wadati, Olmedilla
and Akutsu were overcome in the article [466], where the Hubbard model was treated
within the fermionic R-operator approach. The monodromy operator in [466] is a product
of fermionic R-operators which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation (12.175) and are regular
in the sense of (12.176). Thus, the monodromy operator of [466] is free of twists and covers
the homogeneous as well as the inhomogeneous case. Its ‘supertrace’ reduces to the shift
operator in the homogeneous case when all spectral parameters (λ and the µ’s) assume
the same value. It was therefore possible in [466] to derive a local fermionic Hamiltonian which contains µ as an additional coupling constant. This Hamiltonian is related to
the corresponding generalization of Shastry’s spin Hamiltonian [401] by a Jordan-Wigner
transformation.
Our account below is in many respects equivalent to the account of [466]. We stay more
on the conservative side, however, in that we express operations on the auxiliary space by
usual matrices rather than Fermi operators. Both approaches are connected by the general
arguments of Section 12.3, since our L-matrix as well as the fermionic R-operator of [466]
relate to the R-matrix (12.135) by the general formulae (12.160) and (12.172) (see appendix
12.E).
In Section 12.4.1 we apply the general formula (12.171) to the R-matrix, equation
(12.135), and obtain the Hubbard Hamiltonian if we set the second spectral parameter
µ of the R-matrix equal to zero. Keeping this second spectral parameter, on the other
hand, we obtain a generalized Hamiltonian [466] containing the Hubbard Hamiltonian as
a limiting case. Section 12.4.2 is devoted to a discussion of the symmetries of the Hubbard model on the level of the transfer matrix [178, 399, 464, 466]. It turns out that the
η-pairing symmetry is peculiar, since for our form (12.135) of the R-matrix it is not a
symmetry in the sense of Section 12.3.3. The η-pairing symmetry can be obtained from
the rotational symmetry by means of a Shiba transformation [178]. In our discussion of the
η-pairing symmetry in Section 12.4.2, however, we start from a local argument given in
[466].

12.4.1 Hamiltonian and L-matrix
In the following we denote the R-matrix on the right hand side of (12.135) by Ř(λ, µ).
Let us choose the grading p(1) = p(4) = 0, p(2) = p(3) = 1. Our R-matrix is compatible
with this choice.
We want to show that equation (12.171) generates the Hamiltonian density of the Hubbard
model after appropriate fermionization. First of all, differentiating all the Boltzmann weights

(12.164) built up from an L-fold ordered product of L-matrices (12.227) is the starting point
for the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the Hubbard model which we shall discuss below
in Section 12.6.
In general, we may keep distinct all the ν j entering the deﬁnition of the monodromy
matrix (12.164). The resulting inhomogeneous model will be useful in the next chapter,
where we consider the quantum transfer matrix approach to the thermodynamics of the
Hubbard model.
The fact that the R-matrix (12.135) is not of difference form has an interesting consequence [401]: the second spectral parameter µ is an additional independent parameter of
the model. Setting all the ν j , j = 1, . . . , L, in (12.164) equal to µ we obtain a homogeneous
model which depends on µ and reduces to the Hubbard model in the special case µ = 0.
The generalized model generates a family of local Hamiltonians, because the regularity of
the R-matrix (12.135) extends to all λ = µ. Using once more equation (12.171), this time
with λ0 = ν0 = µ, and the same fermionization scheme as above, we obtain the Hamiltonian

a± = ch(2l) ± sh(2l) cos(2µ) .

(12.231)

Such kinds of amplitudes, depending on the particle densities, are sometimes called correlated hopping amplitudes.
The Hamiltonian (12.229) is hermitian for purely imaginary µ, Re µ = 0. The additional
interactions in the third sum on the right hand side of (12.229) couple the local currents of
up- and down-spin electrons and the average densities of up- and down-spin electrons at
neighbouring lattice sites. Note that the Hamiltonian (12.229) is spin reversal invariant and,
up to a trivial, overall shift, transforms into H (−u) under a Shiba transformation (2.59).
The model deﬁned by (12.229) was ﬁrst obtained in [401, 466]. It is exactly solvable by
construction. So far it has not attracted much attention, but may be worth studying since
unlike many other so-called ‘generalized Hubbard Hamiltonians’, it is a true generalization
of the Hubbard Hamiltonian containing it as a limiting case. The model with non-zero µ
played a role in the construction of a long-range interacting model related to Shastry’s
R-matrix [334] and in the construction of the boost operator for the Hubbard model [301].
We omit the lengthy expression for the L-matrix associated with the Hamiltonian
(12.229). The reader may readily generate it by him- or herself using (12.135) and (12.160).
An explicit expression for the fermionic R-operator can be obtained from the general deﬁnition (12.172). For the sake of completeness we present it in appendix 12.E. The fermionic
R-operator is an alternative tool to perform many of the calculations of the following Sections (see [464, 466]). In our account, however, we shall never make use of its explicit
form.

12.4.2 Symmetries
We now consider the symmetries of the Hubbard model from the point of view of the
underlying Yang-Baxter algebra. In Section 12.3.3 we have learned that it is not the Rmatrix Ř(λ, µ) that determines the symmetries of a fundamental graded model, but the
‘graded R-matrix’ R̃(λ, µ) with matrix elements

R̃βδ (λ, µ) = (−1) p(α) p(γ ) Rβδ (λ, µ) .

have to multiply the right hand side of (12.135) by the permutation matrix P = eαβ ⊗ eγδ ⊗

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

It turns out that spin and η-spin symmetry cannot be treated on the same footing. The
invariance of the Hubbard model under rotations in spin space is a symmetry in the sense
of Section 12.3.3, i.e., it is a consequence of the Lie-algebra invariance of the matrix
R̃(λ, µ). The invariance (for an even number of lattice sites) of the Hamiltonian and the
higher conserved quantities under rotations of the η-spin, on the other hand, follows by a
somewhat different reasoning.
Let us ﬁrst consider the spin. We claim that
[ R̃(λ, µ), sα ⊗ I4 + I4 ⊗ sα ] = 0 ,

(12.240)

for α = x, y, z. This claim is easily veriﬁed. One may, for instance, ﬁrst check it for s+
by explicit multiplication of 16 × 16-matrices. The corresponding equation for s− then
follows by taking the transposed of the invariance equation for s+ and taking into account
that R̃(λ, µ) is symmetric. Finally, the equation for sz follows using [s+ , s− ] = sz and
the Jacobi identity.
We thus have established the invariance of R̃(λ, µ) in the sense of equation (12.185), with
respect to the su(2) representation generated by the sα and may now pursue the general
reasoning of Section 12.3.3. The global quantum space operators corresponding to the
matrices sα are two times the spin operators (2.66). This follows from the graded analogue
of (12.183) upon fermionization. Then (12.188) tells us that
[T (λ), 12 sα + S α ] = 0 ,

(12.241)

α = x, y, z. Note that sα acts in the auxiliary space, but S α acts in the quantum space. Equation (12.241) encodes the commutation relations of the elements of the monodromy matrix
with the spin operators S α . It is valid in the homogeneous as well as in the inhomogeneous
case. According to our general formula (12.189) it follows that
[str(T (λ)), S α ] = 0 ,

(12.242)

for α = x, y, z. Consequentially, in the homogeneous case the Hamiltonian and all the
mutually commuting operators generated by τ (λ) = ln(Û −1 str(T (λ))) preserve the spin.
The matrices η± do not enter invariance equations like (12.240), but the somewhat
different relations
{ R̃(λ, µ), η± ⊗ I4 − I4 ⊗ η± } = 0 .

(12.243)

These relations, too, are easily veriﬁed. One of them has to be proven by explicit calculation,
the other one then follows by taking the transpose and using the symmetry of R̃(λ, µ).
A ﬁrst implication of (12.243) is the invariance equation
[ R̃(λ, µ), ηz ⊗ I4 + I4 ⊗ ηz ] = 0 .

(12.244)

The simple proof relies on the identity [A, [B, C]] = {{A, B}, C} − {{A, C}, B}, which
holds for arbitrary matrices, and on the fact that [η+ , η− ] = ηz . The quantum space oper
ator corresponding to ηz is Lj=1 (X j 11 − X j 44 ) = L − N̂ = −2η z . Using equation (12.188)

12.4 The Hubbard model as a fundamental graded model

447

we obtain the commutation relations between the elements of the monodromy matrix and
the particle number operator,
[T (λ), ηz − N̂ ] = 0 .

(12.245)

Taking the super trace of the latter equation we arrive at
[str(T (λ)), N̂ ] = 0

(12.246)

and thus have shown the invariance of all the higher conserved quantities of the Hubbard
model under global gauge transformations.
Next, we work out the consequences of equation (12.243). Let us write x for either η+
or η− . Then, spelled out in components, (12.243) reads

It follows that

(12.248)

(12.249)

The proof is rather elementary. One ﬁrst uses (12.248) to show (12.249) for two sites and
then proceeds by induction.
For η+ and η− we obtain the local quantum space operators x j = c j,↓ c j,↑ and x j =
†
†
c j,↑ c j,↓ , respectively, and (12.249) turns into
[T (λ), η± ] = {T (λ), η∓ } .

(12.250)

This equation comprises all commutation relations between the elements of the monodromy
matrix and η± . Taking the super trace we arrive at
{str(T (λ)), η± } = 0 .

(12.251)

Thus, unlike the other su(2) generators, S α , η z , the operators η± anticommute with the
transfer matrix. Specializing to λ = 0 in the homogeneous case we recover our former
result (see equation (2.88)) {Û , η± } = 0. It follows that the generating function of local
conserved quantities, τ (λ), commutes with η± ,
[τ (λ), η± ] = 0 .

(12.252)

Thus, the whole set of mutually commuting operators generated by τ (λ) is invariant under
rotations of the η-spin.
Let us now turn to the discussion of the discrete symmetries of the monodromy matrix
(compare Section 2.2). Application of the spin ﬂip operator (2.57) to the L-matrix (12.227)
yields
J (s) L j (λ, 0)J (s) = ML j (λ, 0)M ,

(12.253)

Since (J (s) )2 = id and M 2 = I4 , we conclude that the monodromy matrix of the homogeneous model satisﬁes
J (s) T (λ)J (s) = MT (λ)M .

(12.255)

The latter equation describes the behaviour of the monodromy matrix elements under spin
ﬂips. We obtain, in particular,
[t(λ), J (s) ] = 0 .

(12.256)

Thus, not only the Hamiltonian but all the higher conserved operators generated by τ (λ)
are spin reversal invariant.
It is slightly more tricky to ﬁgure out the behaviour of the L-matrix (12.227) under the
Shiba transformation generated by Ja(sh) , equation (2.58). We shall consider an even number
of lattice sites L from the outset. Let us start with a =↓. Then the functions f j,↓ , g j,↓ deﬁned
in (12.228) transform as

†
(12.257)
J↓(sh) f j,↓ J↓(sh) = (1 − 2n j,↓ )g j,↓ ,


†
J↓(sh) g j,↓ J↓(sh) = −(1 − 2n j,↓ ) f j,↓ .
(12.258)
The L-matrix (12.227) turns into

= e2h (1 − 2n j,↓ ) (σ z ) j ⊗ I2 (σ y ⊗ σ z )L j (λ, 0| − u)(σ y ⊗ σ z ) (σ z ) j−1 ⊗ I2 .
(12.259)
Here we indicated explicitly the dependence of the L-matrix on the coupling u. Taking into
account that 1 − 2n j,↓ = eiπn j,↓ and that L is even, we obtain the transformation rule for
the monodromy matrix in the form

†
J↓(sh) T (λ|u) J↓(sh) = e2h L+iπ N̂↓ (σ y ⊗ σ z )T (λ| − u)(σ y ⊗ σ z ) .
(12.260)
From here it is easy to determine how the generating function τ (λ) behaves under the Shiba
transformation. Observing that str{(σ y ⊗ σ z )T (λ|u)(σ y ⊗ σ z )} = −str{T (λ|u)} we ﬁnd
†

(12.261)
J↓(sh) t(λ|u) J↓(sh) = −e2h L+iπ N̂↓ t(λ| − u) ,



(12.262)
J↓(sh) Û −1 J↓(sh) = −Û −1 e−iπ N̂↓ .
It follows that

†

J↓(sh) τ (λ|u) J↓(sh) = τ (λ| − u) + 2h(λ|u)L .

(12.263)

12.4 The Hubbard model as a fundamental graded model

449

Thus τ (λ|u) is invariant under the Shiba transformation up to a change of the sign of the
coupling and a trivial overall shift.
Remark. The unpleasant term 2h(λ|u)L can be easily avoided by changing the normalization of the L-matrix (12.227). If we replace the prefactor eh / cos2 (λ) in equation (12.227)
by 1, then the term 2h(λ|u)L disappears from equations (12.260) and (12.263). Another
possibility to make (12.263) more symmetric is by redeﬁnition of the generating function
τ (λ|u). Setting τ̃ (λ|u) = τ (λ|u) − h(λ|u)L we obtain

†
J↓(sh) τ̃ (λ|u) J↓(sh) = τ̃ (λ| − u) .

(12.264)

It should be clear from our discussion that the Shiba transformation relates the Hubbard
model with positive u with the Hubbard model with negative u. Instead of working with the
Shiba transformations for down-spin electrons we could have equivalently worked with the
Shiba transformation for up-spin electrons. The corresponding operators J↓(sh) and J↑(sh) are
related by a spin reversal transformation. Hence, we can apply the transformation (12.255)
to equation (12.260) to obtain the transformation rule for the monodromy matrix under a
Shiba transformation which affects the up-spins. We multiply equation (12.260) by J (s) M
from the left and from the right and use (12.255) and M(σ y ⊗ σ z )M = I2 ⊗ σ y . Then

†
J↑(sh) T (λ|u) J↑(sh) = e2h L+iπ N̂↑ (I2 ⊗ σ y )T (λ| − u)(I2 ⊗ σ y ) .

(12.265)

Because of (12.256), equation (12.263) is invariant under spin reversal.
The simultaneous action of Shiba transformations for up- and down-spins on the monodromy matrix is obtained by combining (12.260) and (12.265),
†

J↓(sh) J↑(sh) T (λ|u) J↓(sh) J↑(sh) = eiπ N̂ (σ y ⊗ σ x )T (λ|u)(σ y ⊗ σ x ) .

(12.266)

As a consequence we obtain the following invariance equation for the generating function
τ (λ),

As an exercise for the reader we propose to use the Shiba transformation in order to
re-derive the commutation relations (12.245), (12.250) between the elements of the monodromy matrix and η± , η z out of the commutation relations (12.241) between T (λ) and
S ± , S z . This way the η-pairing symmetry of the transfer matrix was originally established
in [178]. Our derivation here of the η-pairing symmetry (see (12.243) and below) closely
follows in spirit the article [466]. For related work with emphasis on different aspects of
the problem the reader is referred to [399, 464].
The alert reader may have noticed that we have discussed the discrete symmetries only
for the special case of the homogeneous model with the second spectral parameter of the
L-matrix equal to zero. Still, we wish to note that our account can easily be extended to the
completely inhomogeneous case.

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

12.5 Solution of the quantum inverse problem
The quantum inverse scattering method relies on a transformation from a set of local
‘ﬁeld operators’ {e j βα } to a set of non-local operators, the elements of the monodromy
matrix (see ﬁgure 12.3). It is natural to ask: What is the inverse transformation? This
question has a remarkably simple answer [177, 251, 317]. Here we shall present the result of [177], where the inverse transformation was constructed for fundamental graded
models.
We shall assume we are given a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (12.31) which is
regular and unitary. Let p be a grading that is compatible with the R-matrix in the sense of
equation (12.159), and let T (λ) be the corresponding inhomogeneous monodromy matrix
(12.164). Then the following inversion formula holds,
en βα = (−1) p(α) p(β)

n−1


str(T (ν j )) · Tαβ (νn ) ·

j=1

L


str(T (ν j )) .

(12.268)

j=n+1

Note that because of (12.166), no ordering is required for the products on the right-hand
side of (12.268).
The proof of the inversion formula (12.268) for graded inhomogeneous models is given
in appendix 12.B. In the homogeneous case the inversion formula takes a particularly simple
form. Without any loss of generality we may assume that the ‘shift point’ where the L-matrix
elements are proportional to e j βα (see (12.167)) is at λ0 = ν0 = 0. Then str(T (0)) = Û ,
where Û is the shift operator (12.168), and equation (12.268) turns into
en βα = (−1) p(α) p(β) Û n−1 Tαβ (0) Û L−n .

Note that Û L = id. Hence, the latter equation is equivalent to
e1 βα = (−1) p(α) p(β) Tαβ (0) Û −1 ,

(12.270)

by a similarity transformation with Û 1−n .
The proof of (12.270) is considerably more simple than the proof of the inversion formula
(12.268) for the inhomogeneous model. We just evaluate the elements of the monodromy
matrix at the shift point, say λ0 = ν0 = 0, where (12.167) is valid. Then

(12.271)

= (−1) p(α) p(β) e1 αβ Û ,
and the proof of (12.270) is complete.
The analogous calculation for the inhomogeneous case is presented in appendix 12.B in
the proof of lemma 19. The complications that occur in the inhomogeneous case are due to
the more complicated structure of the shift operator for inhomogeneous models (see lemma
17 below).
We illustrate equation (12.269) with the example of the Hubbard model. It is rather
natural to divide the 4 × 4-monodromy matrix of the Hubbard model into four 2 × 2 blocks
[335, 336],
 1

D1 (λ) C11 (λ) C21 (λ) D21 (λ)
 B11 (λ) A11 (λ) A12 (λ) B21 (λ) 

T (λ) = 

C12 (λ)

D22 (λ)

This block structure reﬂects the discrete symmetries and the SO(4) symmetry, which is
connected to the blocks A(λ) and D(λ) of the monodromy matrix.
Using the same fermionization scheme as in Section 12.4 we obtain


†
cn,↑ = Û n−1 C11 (0) + B22 (0) Û L−n ,
(12.273a)


(12.273b)
cn,↑ = Û n−1 B11 (0) + C22 (0) Û L−n ,



(12.273c)
cn,↓ = Û n−1 C21 (0) − B21 (0) Û L−n ,


cn,↓ = Û n−1 B12 (0) − C12 (0) Û L−n .
(12.273d)
Here the operators on the right hand side are elements of the monodromy matrix (12.272)
evaluated at λ = 0. Similar formulae are easily written down for the local spin operators.
In the inhomogeneous case the terms Û n−1 and Û L−n are replaced by products of the super
trace of T (λ) evaluated at the inhomogeneities.

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

The equations (12.273) are expected to be useful for the calculation of matrix elements of
local operators, which is one of the most interesting open problems for the one-dimensional
Hubbard model.

12.6 On the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model
Performing an algebraic Bethe ansatz entails the use of the commutation relations between
the elements of the monodromy matrix, collected in the Yang-Baxter algebra, for the diagonalization of the transfer matrix. A necessary requirement for this type of procedure
is that the monodromy matrix acts triangularly on an appropriate pseudo vacuum state,
such that the pseudo vacuum is an eigenstate of the operators on its diagonal. As we shall
see below, this necessary requirement is fulﬁlled for the Hubbard model. Let us stress,
however, that no general recipe for an algebraic Bethe ansatz is known. Depending on the
structure of the R-matrix an algebraic Bethe ansatz, if possible at all, may be a demanding
task.
In the case of the Hubbard model the construction of an algebraic Bethe ansatz remained
a notorious problem for quite a while. Let us comment on the reasons: (i) The YangBaxter algebra for a 16 × 16 R-matrix comprises the large number of 256 commutation
relations and is not really a convenient tool for calculations as long as no sub-structure of the
commutation relations is identiﬁed. (ii) Moreover, the parameterization of the Boltzmann
weights of our R-matrix (12.135) in terms of λ and µ is inconvenient as well, because of
the constraint (12.109), and does not fall into the usual classiﬁcation scheme of rational,
trigonometric or elliptic R-matrices. The R-matrix is not of difference form. We know,
however, from the coordinate Bethe ansatz solution in Chapter 3 that the ‘spin problem’
of the Hubbard model is intimately related to the rational R-matrix of the XXX spin chain
(or the 6-vertex model with rational Boltzmann weights). Thus, there should be a ‘hidden
6-vertex structure’ inside the Yang-Baxter algebra generated by the R-matrix (12.135).
(iii) The fact that the Lieb-wu equations may be formally generated by the Yang-Baxter
algebra connected with gl(1|2) invariant 3 × 3 R-matrix (12.217) (see [169, 170]) seems to
leave the possibility that there is an algebraic Bethe ansatz not based on Shastry’s R-matrix
and yet to be discovered. (iv) As we shall see below, the monodromy matrix contains too
many creation operators which makes the identiﬁcation of the operators relevant for an
algebraic Bethe ansatz a delicate matter.
The difﬁculties connected with the involved structure of the Yang-Baxter algebra for
the Hubbard model were eventually overcome by Martins and Ramos who constructed an
algebraic Bethe ansatz in [320, 371] (see also [319]). The key points in their analysis were
the discovery of a hidden 6-vertex structure inside the Yang-Baxter algebra and a clever
recursive construction of the eigenvectors, which was inspired by Tarasov’s work [451] on
the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Izergin-Korepin model. Martins and Ramos were led to the
hidden 6-vertex structure through the analysis of a certain rational vertex model generated

12.6 On the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model

453

by the intertwiner of two typical four-dimensional representations of Y(gl(1|2)) [370]. This
intertwiner is a 16 × 16 matrix with 36 non-vanishing Boltzmann weights at the same
positions as in our R-matrix (12.135).
In this section we ﬁrst classify the entries of the monodromy matrix as creation or
annihilation operators, or operators which do not change the particle number. Then we work
out the block structure of the Yang-Baxter algebra generated by the R-matrix (12.135).
After calculating the action of the monodromy matrix on the Fock vacuum |0 , starting
from Subsection 12.6.4, we review Martins’ and Ramos’ construction of the one- and twoparticle eigenstates of the transfer matrix. We obtain the one- and two-particle eigenvalues
of the transfer matrix which will be enough to guess the generalization to the N -particle
case.

12.6.1 Classiﬁcation of the monodromy matrix elements with respect to change of
particle number
The two invariance equations (12.241) for α = z and (12.245) contain the information about
how the action of the elements of the monodromy matrix affects the numbers of up- and
down-spin electrons. For the classiﬁcation of the elements of the monodromy matrix we
need more explicit expressions. Recall that N̂ = N̂↑ + N̂↓ and 2S z = N̂↑ − N̂↓ , where N̂↑
and N̂↓ are the particle number operators for electrons with spin up and spin down. Then
(12.241), (12.245) imply
[T (λ), 12 (ηz − sz ) − N̂↑ ] = [T (λ), 12 (I2 ⊗ σ z ) − N̂↑ ] = 0 ,

(12.274a)

[T (λ), 12 (ηz + sz ) − N̂↓ ] = [T (λ), 12 (σ z ⊗ I2 ) − N̂↓ ] = 0 .

(12.274b)

Performing the matrix multiplications in the auxiliary space explicitly we obtain


 −B11 (λ)
[ N̂↑ , T (λ)] = 
 0

Here the notation for the elements of the monodromy matrix is taken from equation (12.272).
In (12.275) the 32 commutation relations between the elements of the monodromy matrix
and the particle number operators N̂↑ , N̂↓ are written in compact form. Let us pick out the

454

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

commutators involving C11 (λ), B22 (λ), C21 (λ), and B21 (λ),
N̂↑ C11 (λ) = C11 (λ)( N̂↑ + 1) ,

[ N̂↓ , C11 (λ)] = 0 ,

(12.276a)

N̂↑ B22 (λ) = B22 (λ)( N̂↑ + 1) ,

[ N̂↓ , B22 (λ)] = 0 ,

(12.276b)

N̂↓ C21 (λ) = C21 (λ)( N̂↓ + 1) ,

[ N̂↑ , C21 (λ)] = 0 ,

(12.276c)

N̂↓ B21 (λ) = B21 (λ)( N̂↓ + 1) ,

[ N̂↑ , B21 (λ)] = 0 .

(12.276d)

Equations (12.276a), (12.276b) mean that C11 (λ) and B22 (λ), for instance, add an up-spin
electron to a state and do not change the number of down-spin electrons. Thus, C11 (λ) and
B22 (λ) are one-particle creation operators of up-spin electrons. Similarly, C21 (λ) and B21 (λ)
can be interpreted as one-particle creation operators of down-spin electrons.
We leave to the reader the simple task of writing explicitly all the relations contained in
(12.276). It turns out that B11 (λ) and C22 (λ) are one-particle annihilation operators of up-spin
electrons, while C12 (λ) and B12 (λ) annihilate a down-spin electron. The operators A12 (λ) and
A21 (λ) preserve the total number of particles, but ﬂip the spin. D21 (λ) and D12 (λ) create or
annihilate a pair of electrons of opposite spin. The diagonal elements of the monodromy
matrix leave spin and particle number unchanged.
It is a striking fact that we have identiﬁed ﬁve creation operators C11 (λ), C21 (λ), B21 (λ),
2
B2 (λ) and D21 (λ) inside the monodromy matrix. By way of contrast there are only two local
†
†
creation operators, c j,↑ , c j,↓ , of electrons. This means that the choice of creation operators
for the algebraic Bethe ansatz is not obvious. Presumably there is more than one way of
constructing an algebraic Bethe ansatz (compare the construction of eigenstates over the
empty lattice in Chapter 15).
The operator entries of the submatrices A(λ), . . . , D(λ) of the monodromy matrix each
are related by adjungation in quantum space,

D(λ)† = ctg 2L π2 − λ̄ eiπ N̂ σ x D π2 − λ̄ σ x .
(12.277d)
Here no adjungation of matrices is implied with the daggers on the left of hand sideof these
equations. The bar means complex conjugation. Note that the prefactors of ctg 2L π2 − λ̄
could have been avoided if we had chosen a different normalization of the L-matrix (12.227).
Equations (12.277) can easily be proven by induction over L.

12.6.2 Yang-Baxter algebra in block form
The structure of the Yang-Baxter algebra (12.165) generated by the R-matrix (12.135) becomes clearer after performing a similarity transformation which reveals the block structure

We would like to note that the structure of the Yang-Baxter algebra, when written in block
form (12.280), resembles the Yang-Baxter algebra of an (asymmetric) 8-vertex model with
grading p(1) = 0, p(2) = 1. A complete list of the relations contained in equation (12.280)
is given in appendix 12.C.

12.6.3 Action of the monodromy matrix on the vacuum
As for any algebraic Bethe ansatz calculation we have to determine the action of the monodromy matrix on the vacuum. Using the deﬁnitions (12.228) we

12.6.4 Hidden six-vertex structure and one-particle states
In this subsection we shall construct one-particle eigenstates of the transfer matrix t(λ) =
str(T (λ)) = tr(D(λ)) − tr(A(λ)). We shall use a notation that may appear artiﬁcial at ﬁrst
reading, but will turn out to be useful in the two- and more-particle cases. First of all we

creation operators, and C2 (λ) and B1 (λ) are vectors of annihilation operators, respectively.
Let φ (1) (λ) = C1 (λ). We shall seek for eigenvectors of the transfer matrix of the form

Equation (12.296) contains the commutation relations between A(λ) and C1 (µ), but still
is not of the appropriate form. Instead, Ramos and Martins considered a certain linear
combination of (12.296) and (12.297). They were led to this idea by analogy with their
calculations for the gl(1|2) vertex model mentioned above (see [370]), where all Boltzmann
weights are parameterized by rational functions and thus are easier to handle.
Let us introduce the shorthand notation L = I4 − P. Then ř1 can be written as
ρ7
ř1 = I4 − L .

Can this matrix be equivalent to the rational R-matrix (12.50)? If yes, then a reparameterization v(λ) should exist, such that v(λ) − v(µ) = ρ7 /ρ5 . This cannot be the case, since

is therefore equivalent to the R-matrix (12.50) of the spin- 12 XXX chain and, in fact, encodes
the hidden 6-vertex structure discovered by Ramos and Martins. The matrix ř may appear
as an ad hoc notion at this point. We wish to stress, however, that it naturally arises in the
work [335, 336] on the Hubbard model on the inﬁnite interval (see Chapter 15).
We shall now use equation (12.302) in order to introduce the matrix ř into the commutation
relation between A(λ) and C1 (µ). We note the relations
K K t = 2L ,

ρ1ř2 K t = (2ρ3 − ρ1 )K t .

(12.303)

We multiply (12.297) by ρ6 K t /2ρ8 from the right and, using (12.303), add it to (12.296).
The resulting equation is equivalent to

−ρ9 (B ⊗ D̄)L + J (D ⊗ B̄)L − ρ1 J ( D̄ ⊗ B)L = 0 .

provided that the Bethe ansatz equation

is satisﬁed.
The last step is to insert the explicit form of the eigenvalue (1) (λ) of the auxiliary
transfer matrix into (12.321) and (12.322) and to write explicitly the eigenvector |φ (1) .
Since N = 1, the problem is rather trivial, and we could have avoided the machinery of
the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the solution of the auxiliary problem. We included it already
here in order to facilitate the comparison with the two-particle case. From the deﬁnitions
(12.309), (12.310) we have A(1) (λ) + D (1) (λ) = (1 + a(λ, λ1 ))I2 . Thus, A(1) (λ) + D (1) (λ)
is proportional to the unit matrix (acting in the ‘quantum space of the auxiliary problem’).
It follows that
(1) = 1 + a(λ, λ1 ) ,

(12.323)

and that every vector in C2 is a corresponding eigenvector. These ﬁndings are in agreement
with our algebraic Bethe ansatz result. Because of the su(2) symmetry of the auxiliary
monodromy matrix we have to impose the restriction N ≥ 2M (see appendix 3.D.3). Thus,
M = 0 and, using the convention that a product has to be replaced with 1, once its upper limit
is smaller than its lower limit, (12.313) implies the correct result (1) (λ) = 1 + a(λ, λ1 ).

(12.326)
ω2 (λ1 )
For a full understanding of the one-particle states (12.324) we have to study their behaviour under the action of the spin and η-spin operators. Let us start with the spin. The
commutation relations of the monodromy matrix elements with the spin operators are compactly combined in equation (12.241). Those equations contain, in particular, the relations
[S ± , C1 (λ)] = C1 (λ)σ ± ,

(12.327a)

[S z , C1 (λ)] = C1 (λ) 12 σ z .

(12.327b)

The spin operators annihilate the pseudo vacuum |0 . Hence, we infer from (12.327) that
S + |φ (1) = 0 ,

(12.328a)

S z |φ (1) = 12 |φ (1) ,

(12.328b)

S − |φ (1) = C21 (λ1 )|0 .

(12.328c)

Thus, the vector |φ (1) = C11 (λ1 )|0 is a spin- 12 highest weight state, the vectors C11 (λ1 )|0
and C21 (λ1 )|0 form a spin- 12 doublet.
Similarly, we conclude from (12.245) and (12.250) that
{η− , C1 (λ)} = −C2 (λ) ,

(12.329a)

[η z , C1 (λ)] = 12 C1 (λ) ,

(12.329b)

{η+ , C1 (λ)} = 0 .

(12.329c)

η− |φ (1) = 0 ,

(12.330a)

η z |φ (1) = 12 (1 − L)|φ (1) .

(12.330b)

It follows that

12.6 On the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model

463

Thus, |φ (1) is the lowest weight state in a multiplet of η-spin L, the remaining states being
generated by consecutive action of η+ on |φ (1) .
By comparison of the one-particle Bethe ansatz equation (12.326) with the corresponding
one-particle Lieb-Wu equation eik1 L = 1 (see (3.95)) we are led to the reparameterization
[499]
eik(λ) =

ω1 (λ)
= − ctg (λ)e2h
ω2 (λ)

(12.331)

of equation (12.326), which relates the spectral parameter λ to the pseudo momentum k of
the coordinate Bethe ansatz. Let us further deﬁne
ω2 (λ)
ei p(λ) =
(12.332)
= − ctg (λ)e−2h .
ω3 (λ)
The functions k(λ), p(λ) and v(λ), equation (12.300), are then simply related through
v(λ) = − sin(k(λ)) + iu = − sin( p(λ)) − iu .

(12.333)

Hence, the constraint (12.109) connecting λ and h for given u turns into the relation
sin(k) − sin( p) = 2iu

(12.334)

between k and p.

12.6.5 The two-particle states
The generalization of the one-particle calculation of the previous section to two particles is
not straightforward. We expect that the rather general ansatz
|φ (2) = φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 )| F̂ ,
| F̂ = f ⊗ |0 ,

f ∈ C2 ⊗ C 2

(12.335)

should work. But what is the appropriate choice of the vector φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ) of creation operators? It turns out that a choice of the form C1 (λ1 ) ⊗ C1 (λ2 ), which works in the construction
of the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for, say, the supersymmetric t-J model [119], fails in
the case at hand.
In the construction of the one-particle eigenstates we saw that we did not need to consider
the one-particle creation operators B21 (λ), B22 (λ). It was sufﬁcient to work only with C11 (λ),
C21 (λ). For the two-particle states, however, there is yet another candidate for a creation
operator, namely D21 (λ). As we shall see, two-particle eigenstates of the Hubbard model
transfer matrix can be constructed by choosing φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ) as an appropriate combination of C1 (λ1 ) ⊗ C1 (λ2 ) and D21 (λ1 ). An idea for the construction of such an appropriate
combination comes from the observation that a relation of the form
φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ) ∼ φ (2) (λ2 , λ1 )ř (λ1 , λ2 )

(12.336)

is crucial for all known nested algebraic Bethe ansatz calculations. Let us therefore seek

464

The algebraic approach to the Hubbard model

to introduce the matrix ř into the commutation relation between two matrices C(λ) in a
similar manner as in the derivation of equation (12.306) from (12.296) and (12.297).
We take equations (12.C.1m) and (12.C.1p) from appendix 12.C,
ρ6 K t (A ⊗ Ā) − ρ1ř2 (C ⊗ C̄) = −ρ4 (C̄ ⊗ C)ř1 + ρ6 ( D̄ ⊗ D)K t ,

Proceeding similarly as in the derivation of (12.306) we multiply (12.338) by ρ6 K t /2ρ8

12.6 On the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model

465

To show that this ansatz actually works one has to commute the submatrix A(λ) of
the monodromy matrix and the monodromy matrix elements D11 (λ) and D22 (λ) through
φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ). Unfortunately, this is a cumbersome task. We shall omit the details of the
calculation here. One has to use (12.292), (12.295), and (12.307) and a number of additional
commutation relations listed in (12.C.1). The coefﬁcients in the resulting formulae are
rational functions of the Boltzmann weights ρ j and also contain the R-matrix ř of the
auxiliary spin problem. These coefﬁcients have to be appropriately rearranged using certain
identities, involving three different arguments λ, µ, ν, between the Boltzmann weights
and certain elementary properties of the R-matrix ř . There is one guiding principle in the
calculations: as a consequence of (12.343) the coefﬁcients of the different terms are related
by interchange of λ1 and λ2 and multiplication by ρρ41 ř . This fact allows one to ﬁgure out
the required identities between the Boltzmann weights. In appendix 12.D we provide a
complete list of the additional commutation relations and the identities we have used. With
the aid of appendix 12.D the reader should be able to verify the following formulae,

The commutation relations of t(λ) = str(T (λ)) with φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ) are now easily obtained
from (12.345)–(12.347). We take the trace of (12.347) in space zero and subtract the result
from the sum of equations (12.345) and (12.346). Then

(12.350)

Let us compare (12.350) with the corresponding one-particle result (12.318). We see that
the ﬁrst terms on the right-hand sides of both equations are similar to each other. The third
term on the right-hand side of (12.350), however, has a novel structure, not observed in
the one-particle calculation. It is clear from the comparison of (12.318) and (12.350) that
the second term on the right-hand side of (12.350) can be canceled by the same trick as
before. We assume that the ‘spin part’ f ∈ C2 ⊗ C2 of our two-particle ansatz
(12.335)
is

an eigenvector with eigenvalue (1) (λ) of the auxiliary transfer matrix tr0 T (1) (λ) . Then,

are satisﬁed and if f = B (1) (µ1 ) . . . B (1) (µ M ) 10 . Because of the su(2) symmetry of the
auxiliary spin problem, the allowed values of M are restricted to 2M ≤ N , i.e., M = 0, 1.
To complete our picture of the two-particle states just constructed we have to inspect
their behaviour under the action of spin- and η-spin operators. For this purpose we must
commute the spin- and η-spin operators through φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ). The commutation relations
with the vector of creation operators C1 (λ) are collected in equations (12.327), (12.329). In
addition, we need the commutation relations with D11 (λ) and D21 (λ), which can be extracted
from equations (12.241), (12.245), and (12.250),
[S α , (D11 (λ), D21 (λ))] = 0 ,

α = x, y, z ,

(12.359a)

{η− , (D11 (λ), D21 (λ))} = (−D12 (λ), D11 (λ) − D22 (λ)) ,

(12.359b)

[η z , (D11 (λ), D21 (λ))] = (0, D21 (λ)) ,

(12.359c)

{η+ , (D11 (λ), D21 (λ))} = (D21 (λ), 0) .

(12.359d)

Let us consider the spin ﬁrst. We observe that
ξ (σ1α + σ2α ) = 0 ,

α = x, y, z .

(12.360)

Hence, using (12.327), (12.359a), we conclude that
[S α , φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 )] = φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ) 12 (σ1α + σ2α )

(12.361)

for α = x, y, z. The operators 12 (σ1α + σ2α ) are the operators of the components of the total
 ⊗2
spin for the two-site auxiliary spin problem. Let us deﬁne f = B (1) (µ1 ) . . . B (1) (µ M ) 10 ,
M = 0, 1. Then we know from equations (3.D.19) and (3.D.20) of appendix 3.D that
(σ1+ + σ2+ ) f = 0 ,

(12.362)

if the Bethe ansatz equations (12.358) are satisﬁed, and that
S z f = 12 (N − 2M) f ,

(12.363)

irrespective of the Bethe ansatz equations. It follows from (12.361) and from (12.362),
(12.363) that
S + |φ (2) = 0 ,

(12.364a)

S z |φ (2) = 12 (N − 2M)|φ (2) .

(12.364b)

The algebraic Bethe ansatz states |φ (2) are spin 12 (N − 2M) highest weight states.
The equations that encode the lowest weight properties of the two-particle Bethe ansatz
states with respect to η-spin are similar to (12.364),

12.6 On the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Hubbard model

469

The two-particle algebraic Bethe ansatz state |φ (2) is the lowest weight state of a multiplet
of η-spin 12 (L − 2). Equation (12.365b) is valid for arbitrary spectral parameters λ1 , λ2 . For
(12.365a) to be true the Bethe ansatz equations (12.357) must be satisﬁed.
In order to show (12.365b) one uses (12.329b) and (12.359c). These equations imply
[η z , φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 )] = φ (2) (λ1 , λ2 ) .

(12.366)

Recalling that η z |0 = − L2 |0 , we see that (12.365b) follows from (12.366). For the proof of
(12.365a), except for (12.329a), (12.359b), one has to use equation (12.D.2c) from appendix
12.D. When combined, these equations imply that
η− |φ (2) =

*
ρ6 (λ1 , λ2 ) ),
ξ A(λ1 ) ⊗ A(λ2 ) − D11 (λ1 )D11 (λ2 ) | F̂ .
ρ8 (λ1 , λ2 )

(12.367)

Thus (12.365a) follows, if λ1 and λ2 satisfy the Bethe ansatz equations (12.357).
At this point it is interesting to note that we could have obtained the Bethe ansatz equations
(12.357), (12.358) by taking the ansatz (12.335), (12.344) and merely stipulating that it obey
the two su(2) highest weight equations (12.364a) and (12.365a).

12.6.6 The N-particle transfer matrix eigenvalue
Comparing the expressions (12.288), (12.325), and (12.356) for the transfer matrix eigenvalues in the zero-, one-, and two-particle sectors it is natural to guess the following N -particle

These formulae pass all signiﬁcant tests. First of all, it is easy to see that equations
(12.369) and (12.370) turn into the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96) after an appropriate
deﬁnition of charge momenta k j and spin rapidities k . The transformation that connects
the spectral parameter λ with a charge momentum k(λ) was identiﬁed in (12.331). We set
k j = k(λ j ), j = 1, . . . , N . Then (12.331) implies that (ω1 (λ j )/ω2 (λ j )) L = eik j L . In order
to identify the products in equations (12.369), (12.370) with the corresponding products in

470

the Lieb-Wu equations we deﬁne the spin rapidities k = −v(µk ), k = 1, . . . , M, and use
(12.333) and (12.301).
It is also easy to reproduce our former results (3.97) for the eigenvalues of the shift
operator and for the energy eigenvalues from (12.368). We obtain

Here the expression for the energy eigenvalues is in accordance with the local Hamiltonian
(12.226), constructed from the transfer matrix, which differs from (2.31) by a constant shift
u L in the energy.
Finally, as a last argument in favour of (12.368)–(12.370), we wish to note that the Bethe
ansatz equations (12.369), (12.370) are the conditions for the residua at the simple poles of
the rational functions 1/a(λ, µ) in (12.368) to vanish.

12.6.7 On the construction of N-particle states
Ramos and Martins [371] proposed a generalization of the two-particle eigenstates (12.335),
(12.344) of the form
|φ (N ) = φ (N ) (λ1 , . . . , λ N )| F̂ ,
 ⊗N
| F̂ = f ⊗ |0 , f ∈ C2
,

(12.373)

where φ (N ) (λ1 , . . . , λ N ) obeys a second order recursion relation, i.e., φ (N ) depends on φ (N −1)
and on φ (N −2) . Since this is a complicated matter, however, we do not go into the details
and refer the reader to the original work [320, 371] at this point.

12.7 Conclusions
In this chapter we have discussed the algebraic approach to the Hubbard model. Our account
was based on Shastry’s R-matrix [312,391,393,401] and on the quantum inverse scattering
method for fundamental graded models [177,179,276]. In the section on the algebraic Bethe
ansatz we closely followed the work of Martins and Ramos [320,371]. We worked, however,
within a fermionic formulation of the problem and used the slightly modiﬁed ‘fermionic
version’ (12.135) of Shastry’s R-matrix. This brings out more clearly the structure of the
transfer matrix eigenvalue which was presented here for the ﬁrst time in the form (12.368)
reﬂecting the grading (+, −, −, +) and decaying into a product of a ‘rational part’ (term in
square brackets in (12.368)) with a ‘non-rational’ part. Written in this form the eigenvalue
of the transfer matrix looks similar to the one obtained in [362] for a gl(2|1) based vertexmodel.

12.7 Conclusions

471

In a sense the results of this chapter explain why the Hubbard model is solvable by Bethe
ansatz. Of course, this is not the only achievement of the algebraic approach. In the next
chapter we shall see that it not only reproduces the results of the coordinate Bethe ansatz,
but enables us to go further. The results of this chapter will turn out to be crucial for the
calculation of the largest eigenvalue of the quantum transfer matrix, the analysis of which
leads to an alternative approach of the thermodynamics of the Hubbard model.
We are convinced that the algebraic approach to the Hubbard model bears some potential
for future applications. Further developments are expected from a better understanding of
the algebraic Bethe ansatz eigenstates, which may ﬁnally lead to a proof of the norm formula
(3.120) and to explicit formulae for form factors in the ﬁnite volume. We also expect that
Shastry’s R-matrix will eventually be understood as a special case of a more general solution
of the Yang-Baxter equation that generates the two-parametric model proposed by Alcaraz
and Bariev in [15].
The appendices to this chapter contain technical details left out in the main text and a
collection of formulae needed in the algebraic Bethe ansatz calculation in Section 12.6.

Appendices to Chapter 12

12.A A proof that Shastry’s R-matrix satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation
We show below that Shastry’s R-matrix satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation. Our account
closely follows Shiroishi and Wadati [401] who carried out explicitly an idea of Korepanov
[263] to use the so-called tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebra [263–265] for coupling two
su(2)-XX models into a ‘two-layer’ interacting model. Shiroishi and Wadati discovered
[401] that this model is nothing but Shastry’s spin model (related to the Hubbard model
through a Jordan-Wigner transformation) and [400] that the tetrahedral Zamolodchikov
algebra may be interpreted as a generalization of Shastry’s decorated star triangle relation.
Here we will be slightly more general than the original literature. We will couple two
su(d)-XX models for arbitrary d ≥ 2, i.e., we will show that the general R-matrix (12.110)
satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation. In fact, the proof of Shiroishi and Wadati goes through
without any modiﬁcation, because the ‘S-matrix’ (see below) occurring in the tetrahedral
Zamolodchikov algebra constructed from the su(d)-XX model R-matrices (12.92) is independent of d. This was ﬁrst noticed (though not emphasized) in [360].

12.A.1 The tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebra
Let us ﬁrst of all introduce the tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebra. We deﬁne
R 0jk = R jk (θ j − θk ) ,

R 1jk = R jk (θ j + θk )C j

(12.A.1)

for jk = 12, 13, 23. Here R is the R-matrix of the su(d)-XX model deﬁned below (12.92)
and C is the conjugation matrix (12.95).

Proof. Equation (12.A.2) is a set of eight identities, since the indices a, b, c take values 0, 1 each. The eight identities come in two groups of four, the ﬁrst group corresponding to (a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1) the second one to (a, b, c) =
(1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1). We ﬁrst show that due to the properties (12.94), (12.96)
of the conjugation matrix C the identities in the respective groups are mutually equivalent.
Then it is sufﬁcient to explicitly verify one identity in every group. For the ﬁrst group

Replacing λ by θ1 , µ by θ2 and ν by −θ3 in the Yang-Baxter equation (12.21) and
multiplying by C1 C2 from the right we obtain
R12 (θ1 − θ2 )R13 (θ1 + θ3 )C1 R23 (θ2 + θ3 )C2

Thus, (12.A.2) is satisﬁed for (a, b, c) = (0, 1, 1). The second equation (12.A.6) follows
from (12.96). The proof for (a, b, c) = (1, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0) is similar.
Next, let us assume that (12.A.2) is satisﬁed for (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1),
R12 (θ1 + θ2 )C1 R13 (θ1 + θ3 )C1 R23 (θ2 + θ3 )C2

Replacing θ3 by −θ3 , multiplying by C1 C2 from the right and using (12.94) and (12.96) the
latter equation turns into
R12 (θ1 + θ2 )C1 R13 (θ1 − θ3 )R23 (θ2 − θ3 )
= U (θ1 , θ2 , −θ3 ) R23 (θ2 + θ3 )C2 R13 (θ1 + θ3 )C1 R12 (θ1 + θ2 )C1

+ W (θ1 , θ2 , −θ3 ) R23 (θ2 − θ3 )R13 (θ1 + θ3 )C1 R12 (θ1 − θ2 ) .
Thus, (12.A.2) is satisﬁed for (a, b, c) = (1, 0, 0) if and only if it is satisﬁed for (a, b, c) =
(1, 1, 1). One shows in a similar way that the cases (a, b, c) = (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) as well are
equivalent to (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1).
The remaining step in the proof of our lemma is the veriﬁcation of equation (12.A.8).
First of all, using (12.94), (12.96) we deduce that (12.A.8) is equivalent to
Ř23 (θ1 + θ2 ) Ř12 (−θ1 − θ3 ) Ř23 (−θ2 − θ3 ) = U Ř12 (θ2 − θ3 ) Ř23 (θ1 − θ3 ) Ř12 (θ1 + θ2 )
+ V Ř12 (θ2 − θ3 ) Ř23 (θ1 + θ3 ) Ř12 (−θ1 + θ2 )(Id 2 − 2Q 212 )
+ W Ř12 (θ2 + θ3 ) Ř23 (θ1 − θ3 ) Ř12 (−θ1 + θ2 ) .
(12.A.10)
Here we dropped the arguments of the functions U, V, W and used the second equation
(12.94b) in order to replace C1 C2 by Id 2 − 2Q 212 . Inserting the deﬁnition (12.83) of the
matrix Ř into (12.A.10), the equation turns into a polynomial identity in Q 12 and Q 23 with
trigonometric coefﬁcients depending on θ1 , θ2 , θ3 . Now Q is a representation of the free
fermion algebra (12.81). This suggest that upon substituting A1 = Q 12 , A2 = Q 23 equation
(12.A.10) may be valid as an identity in the free fermion algebra.
To proceed with the proof we exploit (12.81) to obtain the useful formula

Let us replace Q 12 by A1 and Q 23 by A2 in equation (12.A.10). Then the term on the lefthand side of (12.A.10) is of the form (12.A.11), the ﬁrst and the third terms on the right-hand
side are of the form (12.A.12), and the second term on the right-hand side is of the form
(12.A.13). Upon appropriately specifying the coefﬁcients s1 , c1 , s2 , . . . and comparing the
terms in front of the ten independent monomials 1, A1 , A2 , . . . , A21 A22 we end up with ten
linear equations for U, V, W . The terms multiplying 1, A2 , A1 A2 , for instance, yield
cos(θ1 + θ2 ) cos(θ1 + θ3 ) cos(θ2 + θ3 ) = U cos(θ2 − θ3 ) cos(θ1 − θ3 ) cos(θ1 + θ2 )
+ V cos(θ2 − θ3 ) cos(θ1 + θ3 ) cos(θ1 − θ2 )

+ W sin(θ1 − θ3 ) cos(θ1 − θ2 ) ,
cos(θ1 + θ2 ) sin(θ1 + θ3 ) sin(θ2 + θ3 ) = U sin(θ2 − θ3 ) sin(θ1 − θ3 ) cos(θ1 + θ2 )
+ V sin(θ2 − θ3 ) sin(θ1 + θ3 ) cos(θ1 − θ2 )
+ W sin(θ2 + θ3 ) sin(θ1 − θ3 ) cos(θ1 − θ2 ) .
(12.A.14)
These equations have the unique solution (12.A.5). The reader may easily generate the
remaining 7 linear equations and may verify that they are solved by U, V, W , equation
(12.A.5), which completes the proof of the lemma.

Korepanov [264, 265] studied the case d = 2 in a more general context. Instead of the
trigonometric R-matrix (12.93) he considered a more general free-fermion R-matrix parameterized by Jacobi-elliptic functions. For this more general R-matrix (in the case d = 2) he

with (12.A.12) and (12.A.13) we obtain two sets of ten linear equations which have the



12.A.2 The proof
The proof of Shiroishi and Wadati is based on the lemmata 15 and 16. Quite generally, these
lemmata can be used to study the question whether a function α(λ, µ) exists such that
Ř(λ, µ) = ř (λ − µ) + α(λ, µ) ř (λ + µ)(C ↑ C ↓ ⊗ Id 2 )

(12.A.19)

solves the Yang-Baxter equation (12.30). Here the notation refers to Section (12.2.3). The
matrix ř (λ) is a product of two R-matrices of the su(d)-XX model embedded into End(Cd ⊗
2
2
Cd ⊗ C d ⊗ C d ) ∼
= End(Cd ⊗ Cd ) (see (12.99)). Furthermore, C ↑ = C ⊗ Id and C ↓ =
Id ⊗ C, where C is the conjugation matrix (12.95).
We shall show below that Ř, equation (12.A.19), is a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation
(12.30) if
α(λ, µ) =

cos(λ − µ)sh(h(λ) − h(µ))
cos(λ + µ)ch(h(λ) − h(µ))

(12.A.20)

12.A A proof that Shastry’s R-matrix satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation

477

where h(λ) is implicitly deﬁned by the constraint equation
sh(2h) = u sin(2λ) .

(12.A.21)

The R-matrix (12.A.19) with (12.A.20) and (12.A.21) is related to the su(d) version (12.110)
of Shastry’s R-matrix through a gauge transformation (see below lemma 10) and through
multiplication by β(λ, µ), equation (12.115). Thus, the su(d) version (12.110) of Shastry’s
R-matrix satisﬁes the Yang-Baxter equation.
We begin with adjusting our notation to the previous subsection where the tetrahedral
Zamolodchikov algebra was introduced. Instead of λ, µ, ν we shall write θ1 , θ2 , θ3 . The
matrices
rσ0 jk = rσ jk (θ j − θk ) ,

rσ1 jk = rσ jk (θ j + θk )C σj

(12.A.22)

for σ =↑, ↓ and jk = 12, 13, 23 generate two commuting representations of the tetrahedral
Zamolodchikov algebra (12.A.2) with S-matrix (12.A.3), (12.A.4) and, in addition, satisfy
(12.A.15). Let us consider the ansatz
R jk = r↑0 jk r↓0 jk + α jk r↑1 jk r↓1 jk

(12.A.23)

and let us insert it into the Yang-Baxter equation R12 R13 R23 = R23 R13 R12 . Using (12.A.3)

Here we have to insert the explicit expressions (12.A.4), (12.A.5) of the ‘S-matrix’ elements
and (12.A.16) of the coefﬁcients X , Y and Z . The resulting equations simplify by application
of the addition theorems for trigonometric functions. All in all there remain six equations
of the form
α12 A + α13 B + α23 C + α12 α13 α23 D = 0 .

(12.A.36)

By taking appropriate linear combinations of these equations they can be reduced to just
two linearly independent equations, e.g.,
α12 sin(2(θ1 − θ3 )) − α13 sin(2(θ1 − θ2 )) + α12 α13 α23 sin(2(θ2 + θ3 )) = 0 ,

(12.A.37)

It is easy to see that the latter equation is solved by α jk = α(θ j , θk ), jk = 12, 13, 23 with
α(λ, µ) according to (12.A.20) and(12.A.21), which completes the proof.
Remark. It should be clear that also two su(d)-XX models with different values of d, say
d1 and d2 , can be coupled to a generalization of Shastry’s R-matrix.

12.B A proof of the inversion formula
In this appendix we supply a proof originally given in [177] of the general inversion formula (12.268) for fundamental graded and inhomogeneous models. The proof relies on the
properties of an appropriate generalization of the shift operator whose construction is our
ﬁrst concern here.
The inhomogeneous monodromy matrix as deﬁned in (12.164) is an ordered product
of L-matrices. In the following we shall indicate the order of the factors by supplying
subscripts to the monodromy matrix
T1...L (λ; ν1 , . . . , ν L ) = T (λ; ν1 , . . . , ν L ) = L L (λ, ν L ) . . . L1 (λ, ν1 ) .

(12.B.1)

As can be seen from equations (12.173) and (12.174) the fermionic R-operator
f
R j j+1 (ν j , ν j+1 ) interchanges the two neighbouring factors L j+1 (λ, ν j+1 ) and L j (λ, ν j )
in the monodromy matrix. Since the symmetric group S L is generated by the transpositions
of nearest neighbours, the L-matrices on the right hand side of (12.B.1) can be arbitrarily
reordered by application of an appropriate product of fermionic R-operators. This means
that for every τ ∈ S L there exists an operator Rτ1...L (ν1 , . . . , ν L ), which is a product of
fermionic R-operators and induces the action of the permutation τ ∈ S L on the inhomogeneous monodromy matrix,
Rτ1...L (ν1 , . . . , ν L )T1...L (λ; ν1 , . . . , ν L )
= Tτ (1)...τ (L) (λ; ντ (1) , . . . , ντ (L) )Rτ1...L (ν1 , . . . , ν L ) .

(12.B.2)

The non-graded analogue of this operator was introduced in [316]. The generalized shift
operator we are looking for is a special case of Rτ1...L (ν1 , . . . , ν L ) for τ being a cyclic
permutation.
Let us ﬁrst of all construct the operator Rτ1...L (ν1 , . . . , ν L ) explicitly for arbitrary
τ ∈ S L . We shall use the shorthand notations Rτ1...L = Rτ1...L (ν1 , . . . , ν L ), T1...L (λ) =

T1...L (λ; ν1 , . . . , ν L ), and R jk = R jk (ν j , νk ) whenever the order of the inhomogeneities

Since the transpositions of nearest neighbours π j , j = 1, . . . , L − 1, generate the symmetric
group S L , there is a ﬁnite sequence ( j p )np=1 , such that τ = π j1 . . . π jn . Let τ p = π j1 . . . π j p ,
p = 1, . . . , n and τ0 = id. Then τ = τn , and, using (12.B.5), we conclude that

Thus, we have constructed an explicit expression for the operator Rτ1...L ,

Equations (12.292), (12.295), (12.307), (12.341), (12.D.1), and (12.D.2) are sufﬁcient to
arrange the operators on the right hand sides of (12.345)–(12.347) in the appropriate order,
which is the ﬁrst step to be done in the algebraic Bethe ansatz for two particles. In a second
step the coefﬁcients multiplying the operators have to be simpliﬁed. For this task we use
the identity
(ξ ⊗ M)P12 = ξ ⊗ M + M ⊗ ξ ,

12.E An explicit expression for the fermionic R-operator of the Hubbard model
In [464, 466] an explicit expression for the fermionic R-operator was derived without
recourse to Shastry’s R-matrix (see, however, the appendix of [466]). Here we shall show that
this fermionic R-operator is equivalent to our R-matrix (12.135). As before we shall denote

(12.135). In fact, we ﬁrst derived (12.135) by applying equation (12.172) to (12.E.3) which

which directly connects (12.135) with Shastry’s R-matrix.

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

A very curious situation arises in the context of the calculation of the partition function from
the spectrum of an integrable Hamiltonian. Despite the validity of the Bethe ansatz equations
for all energy eigenvalues of the model the direct evaluation of the partition function is rather
difﬁcult. In contrast to ideal quantum gases the eigenstates are not explicitly known: the
Bethe ansatz equations provide just implicit descriptions that pose problems of their own
kind. Yet, knowing the behaviour of quantum chains at ﬁnite temperatures is important for
many reasons. As a matter of fact, the groundstate is strictly inaccessible due to the very
fundamentals of thermodynamics. Therefore the study of ﬁnite temperatures is relevant for
theoretical as well as experimental reasons. At high temperatures, quantum systems show
only trivial static properties without correlations. Lowering the temperature, the systems
enter a large regime with non-universal correlations and ﬁnally approach the quantum critical
point at exactly zero temperature showing universal, non-trivial properties with divergent
correlation lengths governed by conformal ﬁeld theory [51].
In Chapter 5 of this book we have discussed the traditional Thermodynamical Bethe
Ansatz (TBA) as developed for the Heisenberg model and the Hubbard model [155, 433–
435] on the basis of a method [496] invented for the Bose gas. Here, the partition function
was evaluated in the thermodynamic limit by identifying the dominant energy states. The
macro-state for a given temperature T is described by a set of root densities (Section 5.2)
satisfying integral equations obtained from the Bethe ansatz equations. In terms of the
density functions expressions for the energy and the entropy are derived. The minimization
of the free energy functional yields what are nowadays known as the TBA equations.
There are ‘loose ends’ in the above sketched procedure. Most importantly, the description of the spectrum of the Heisenberg model was built on the so-called ‘string hypothesis’
according to which admissible Bethe ansatz patterns of roots are built from regular building
blocks. This hypothesis was criticized a number of times and led to activities providing alternative access to the ﬁnite temperature properties [42,253,254,261,425–427,438,456,459].
The central idea of these works was a lattice path-integral formulation of the partition function of the Hamiltonian and the deﬁnition of a suitable ‘quantum transfer matrix’ (QTM),
cf. also Section 13.1. At this point we would just like to mention that the two different
approaches yield completely different equations; however, both are correct! This is understood in detail for the Heisenberg model [253, 281] as the TBA results (originally obtained
488

13.1 The quantum transfer matrix and integrability

489

in a combinatorial manner) can be obtained from the QTM procedure in an algebraic way
by use of the fusion hierarchy described in appendix 13.A. For the Hubbard model the
analogous statement is still in the state of conjecture.
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the concepts and techniques of the analysis
of eigenvalues of the QTM. In order to familiarize the reader with this alternative approach
we use the Heisenberg chain as a warm-up exercise in Section 13.2. The Hubbard model
poses some additional problems as it is based on a non-difference type solution to the
Yang-Baxter equation. We therefore collect some essential properties of the Hamiltonian
in Section 13.3, present the Bethe ansatz results for the Hubbard QTM in Section 13.4
and map these to an auxiliary problem that enjoys the property of being of difference
type, see Section 13.5. The Bethe ansatz equations of the latter system are transformed
into a ﬁnite set of coupled non-linear integral equations (NLIE) in Section 13.6 and the
largest eigenvalue of the QTM is expressed in terms of integrals of the solution functions in
Section 13.7.
The main strength of the ﬁnite set of NLIEs is its usefulness in the entire temperature
range from high to extremely low temperatures. As a demonstration of this we present
in Section 13.8 a numerical analysis of the speciﬁc heat, as well as magnetic and charge
susceptibilities of the Hubbard chain. In Section 13.9 we analytically solve or simplify the
NLIEs in various limiting cases. Notably in the low-temperature limit we ﬁnd the structure
of the dressed energy formalism known from ﬁnite-size analysis of the Hamiltonian at
exactly T = 0.

13.1 The quantum transfer matrix and integrability
In this section we approach the problem of quantum systems at ﬁnite temperatures in terms
of classical systems on lattices in one dimension higher. In many applications, the quantum
systems are considered as the original objects and the classical systems as derived objects. In
standard treatments of quantum systems on chains this leads to classical models on chequerboard lattices. Our viewpoint is slightly different. We consider the classical systems as
primary and the quantum system as secondary as it is derived in the Hamiltonian limit from
a suitable transfer matrix. This will lead us to classical systems on lattices that are partially
staggered with alternating rows, but identical columns.
We ﬁrst review some notations and basic properties of R-matrices (as collections of local
Boltzmann weights) and the associated L-matrices, see Chapter 12. The elements of the
L-matrix at site j are operators acting in the local Hilbert space h j ! Cd with dimension
d. The L-matrix’ element in row α and column β is given in terms of the R-matrix

indices is performed. A direct consequence of the Yang-Baxter equation satisﬁed by the

For all systems we are going to consider, we ﬁnd for small spectral parameters λ and µ
the Hamiltonian limit
R1,2 (λ, µ) = P[1 − (λ − µ)H1,2 ] + O(λ2 , λµ, µ2 ),

operator, P(x ⊗ y) = y ⊗ x). This deﬁnes the local interaction H1,2 in the space h 1 ⊗ h 2
(here a trivial coefﬁcient may have to be introduced as in (12.53) in order to achieve
hermiticity of the operator.)
A direct consequence of (13.3) is the expansion of T (λ) for small λ (and zero µi parameters)

We further introduce an auxiliary transfer matrix T (λ) made of Boltzmann weights

T (λ) = e−i−λHL +O(λ ) ,

so that the partition function is given by
Z L = Tr e−β HL = lim Tr [T (τ )T (τ )] N /2 |τ =β/N .

We regard the resulting system as a ﬁctitious two-dimensional model on a L × N square
lattice, cf. ﬁgure 13.2, where N is the extension in the ﬁctitious (imaginary time) direction,
sometimes referred to as the Trotter number. The lattice consists of alternating rows, each
of which is a product of only R weights or of only R weights, respectively. All columns
are identical and are made up of alternating R and R weights. This formulation realizes a
lattice path integral of the quantum system in the sense that the trace of an exponential of
the Hamiltonian is replaced by a summation over all conﬁgurations (‘paths’) of a classical
model.
It is therefore very natural to introduce a different transfer matrix concept based on the
transfer direction along the horizontal axis (chain) and to investigate the column-to-column

importance to the treatment of the thermodynamic limit.

transfer matrix being the contribution of all Boltzmann weights of a particular column to
the total partition function. In the remainder of this chapter we will refer to the columnto-column transfer matrix (in particular in the limit of Trotter number N → ∞) as the
‘quantum transfer matrix’ of the quantum chain, and denote it by T QTM , because it is the
closest analogue to the transfer matrix of a classical spin chain.
Now, by looking at the system in a 90◦ rotated frame which turns R and R weights into
R and R weights, it is natural to deﬁne a general QTM with arbitrary spectral parameter λ

Using the QTM we may express the partition function as

(13.10)

Here a note on our general terminology is in order. Throughout this book we use the concept
of the monodromy matrix and its associated transfer matrix. The elements of the monodromy
matrix are operators in a Hilbert space that we call ‘quantum space’. The transfer matrix
is obtained by taking the trace with respect to the ‘auxiliary space’ of the monodromy
matrix, yielding an operator acting on the ‘quantum space’. The procedure of taking a trace
in quantum/auxiliary space is denoted by Tr/Traux . Note that the auxiliary/quantum space
of the row-to-row transfer matrix corresponds to the quantum/auxiliary space of the QTM
when embedding these objects into the 2d lattice!
The free energy f per lattice site is deﬁned by f = −k B T lim L→∞ lim N →∞ log Z L ,N /L.

Of particular interest is the spectrum of eigenvalues (λ, τ ) of T QTM (λ, τ ). There is a gap

one for R and R obtained through rotation. Hence the intertwiner for R vertices is identical to the
intertwiner for R vertices.

Now the evaluation of the free energy is reduced to that of the single eigenvalue max .
Of course, a sophisticated treatment is necessary in taking the Trotter limit N → ∞ as
τ = β/N now explicitly depends on it. The following sections are devoted to this analysis.
A general comment is in order. It seems redundant to deﬁne T QTM (λ, τ ) for arbitrary
λ as we only need the value λ = 0. The general case, however, manifests the integrability
structure and the existence of inﬁnitely many conserved quantities. This is best seen in the
commutativity of the matrices with different λ’s
[T QTM (λ, τ ), T QTM (λ , τ )] = 0,

(13.13)

with ﬁxed τ . One can prove this by showing that two QTMs are intertwined by the same R
operator as for the row-to-row case, graphically demonstrated in ﬁgure 13.3. The ﬁnal step
in the proof of commutativity is the standard railroad argument demonstrated for the QTM
in ﬁgure 13.4. The existence of the parameter labeling the family of commuting matrices
makes the subsequent analysis much more transparent. We will investigate the eigenvalues
(λ, τ ) in dependence on λ where distributions of zeroes occur along lines parallel to the
imaginary axis. For the sake of convenience we perform a rotation in the complex plane by
substituting λ by iv, i.e. we will investigate (iv, τ ).
Next we want to comment on the study of the thermodynamics of the quantum chain in
the presence of an external ﬁeld that couples to a conserved quantity, e.g. a magnetic ﬁeld

we have D = diag(exp(βh/2), exp(−βh/2)).
It will turn out that these modiﬁcations can still be treated exactly as the additional
operators acting on the bonds belong to symmetries of the model. Therefore, the properties
of many-particle systems can be studied within a grand canonical ensemble for general
magnetic ﬁelds and chemical potentials.

the only non-zero matrix elements are equal to 1 and are realized for pairwise identical local indices.
Lower row: the product of two QTM’s for inﬁnite temperature reproduces the QTM with a scale factor
equal to the dimension d of the local Hilbert space.

Inﬁnite Temperature
Let us now discuss the inﬁnite temperature case with τ = β/N = 0. Here the QTM
simpliﬁes enormously as the R-matrix (13.3) with spectral parameters λ = µ = 0 reduces
to P. With T := T QTM (0, τ = 0) we ﬁnd
T · T = d · T,
Tr T = d,

(13.17)

with d being the dimension of the local Hilbert space. The derivation of the ﬁrst property is
illustrated in ﬁgure 13.5, the second property is derived in a completely analogous manner.
From the ﬁrst line we see that the eigenvalues are 0 or d, the second line implies that exactly
one eigenvalue takes the value d and all remaining eigenvalues are equal to 0. From
max = d,

(13.18)

and a view to (13.12) we ﬁnd the expected high-temperature asymptotics f = −k B T log d.
This limit is actually realized by the free energy of the Hubbard model obtained in the
TBA approach where (5.69) corresponds to (13.18) with d = 4. (The slightly more general
case of inﬁnite temperature with ﬁnite ratios µ/T and B/T is also found by the above
argument: (13.17) still holds with d replaced by 1 + exp((µ + B)/T ) + exp((µ − B)/T ) +
exp(2µ/T ).)
However, the main application of (13.18) is the identiﬁcation of the largest eigenvalue
of the QTM: very often we will restrict our analysis to a special solution to the eigenvalue
equation that ‘happens’ to yield the largest eigenvalue. A detailed study of all other eigenvalues and the formal proof that those are smaller is technically rather difﬁcult. Fortunately,
the largest eigenvalue of the QTM is known to be unique and separated by a gap from the
rest of the spectrum [425, 427]. Furthermore this eigenvalue is an analytic function of the

496

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

temperature T (= 0) with the high-temperature limit (13.18). Conversely, any eigenvalue of
the QTM that happens to be analytic in T with high-temperature limit (13.18) is the largest
eigenvalue for all T !

13.2 The Heisenberg chain
Before presenting the thermodynamics of the Hubbard model by use of the above introduced
method we apply it to the simpler model of the isotropic spin- 12 Heisenberg chain with
Hamiltonian


j=1 α=x,y,z

S αj S αj+1 ,

(13.19)

where S αj is the α-component of the spin operator acting in the jth local Hilbert space.
The operator (13.19) is obtained in the Hamiltonian limit of the six-vertex model which
is a difference type solution R(λ, µ) = R(λ − µ) to the YBE. The Hamiltonian limit (13.3)
yields the desired (hermitian) local interaction if we choose c in (12.48) imaginary, actually
c = 2i, instead of real as done in Chapter 12.1.
The diagonalization of the QTM is achieved by the algebraic Bethe ansatz very much like
to the homogeneous case of the row-to-row transfer matrix. In the latter case the L-matrix
is given in (12.52). In our ‘staggered’ case (13.9) we ﬁnd

α
L j QTM β (λ, µ) =
(13.20)
c(λ − µ)δβα + b(λ − µ)e j αβ , for j even.
QTM
We note that the two expressions for L QTM
j even (λ, µ) [=: L(λ − µ)], and L j odd (λ, µ) differ
only slightly. A direct calculation shows that up to some scalar factor the second expression
L j odd (λ, µ) is equal to r −1 · L(λ − µ − ic) · r where the operator r acts in the local Hilbert
space with r · e1 = −e2 , r · e2 = +e1 . (This is based on a relation of the R- and R-matrices
known in S-matrix theory as ‘crossing symmetry’.) Therefore, the QTM is equivalent to
a staggered row-to-row transfer matrix with alternating spectral parameters λ − µ and
λ − µ − ic. Due to this property the diagonalization of the QTM may be reduced to that of
a seemingly simpler system of L-operators of the same type with only shifts of the spectral
parameters. However, a direct diagonalization of the QTM is not more involved. Hence we
will not use the special ‘crossing symmetry’ satisﬁed by the Heisenberg model.

From this we see that the monodromy matrix corresponding to T QTM (λ, τ ) is uppertriangular when being applied to |0 . Hence the entire reasoning of Section 12.1.7 holds
with result (12.67) for the eigenvalue provided the vacuum functions (12.70) are replaced

The eigenvalue (λ, τ ) of T QTM (λ, τ ) is now given by (12.67). After some substitutions
λ → iv, µ j → iv j , c = 2i and factorization of common terms of the vacuum functions we
ﬁnd the following expression
(iv, τ ) =

Here m (= 0, . . . , N /2) is an integer and is identical to m = N /2 in the case of the largest

condition of the QTM with (imaginary) twist angle βh.
The ‘unknown’ zeroes of q(v) are the Bethe ansatz rapidities and are determined by the

As far as analytical properties are concerned, there is a profound difference as in (13.29)
the ratio of φ-functions possesses zeroes and poles that converge to the real axis in the
limit N → ∞. As a consequence, the distribution of Bethe ansatz rapidities is discrete
and shows an accumulation point at the origin, cf. ﬁgure 13.6. This prevents the deﬁnition
of meaningful root densities. Hence, in contrast to the Hamiltonian case, the treatment of
the problem by means of linear integral equations is not possible. For N = ∞ the number
of rapidities inside/outside of any (arbitrarily small) open neighbourhood of the origin is
inﬁnite/ﬁnite. In the limit of temperature T → ∞ (β → 0) all rapidities v j converge to 0.
For T → 0 (β → ∞) the rapidities move to inﬁnity. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 13.7.

13.2.1 Derivation of non-linear integral equations I
The next step in the treatment of the thermodynamics of the Heisenberg chain is the derivation of a set of integral equations for the function a(v). These equations will turn out to be
non-linear. A major ingredient in our reasoning will be certain analytical properties of the
functions.

0.005, 0.05, 0.1. Note that for lower temperature, i.e. higher value of τ , the rapidities increase.

In ﬁgure 13.8 the distribution of zeroes and poles of a(v) is shown resulting from the
explicit factorization in the deﬁnition (13.29). Next we deﬁne the associated auxiliary
function A(v) by
A(v) = 1 + a(v).

(13.30)

Of course, the set of poles of A(v) is identical to the set of poles of a(v). However, the
set of zeroes is different. From (13.28) we ﬁnd that the Bethe ansatz rapidities are zeroes
of A(v) and are depicted by open circles in ﬁgure 13.9. There are additional zeroes off
the real axis with imaginary parts close to ±2. These zeroes are depicted in ﬁgure 13.9
by open squares. They are, however, not of further interest to our immediate reasoning. In
the remainder of this section we are going to formulate a linear integral expression for the
function log a(v) in terms of log A(v). The idea underlying our calculation is the observation
that
r all functions we are dealing with are rational functions and hence are determined by the positions
of their zeroes and poles and the asymptotic value for the argument approaching ∞,
r all zeroes and poles of a(v) are explicitly known or directly related to the zeroes of A(v) at the real
axis (i.e. v j ).

of rapidities v j , is equal to N /2 and hence equal to the order of the pole at −iτ . Therefore
the integrand log A(w) does not show any non-zero winding number on the contour and as
a result the integral is well deﬁned. We may evaluate the integral (13.31) rather easily by
performing an integration by parts, observing that the ‘surface term’ vanishes and obtain

Alternative derivation
Identity (13.33) was derived by direct computations, because the function [log A] is
meromorphic, or more precisely analytic apart from simple poles. Hence by use of Cauchy’s
theorem the explicit expression for the integral could be derived. In the case of the Hubbard
model we would like to apply a similar strategy. However, the functions involved in the
latter analysis possess isolated as well as non-isolated singularities. We therefore present a
proof for the identity (13.33) without resorting to the use of a particular type of singularity.
Let g(v) be an analytic function with certain singularities in the complex plane and L
be a contour surrounding the (sub)set of singularities S. We deﬁne the function f (v) for
complex v outside the contour L by

1
1
f (v) :=
g(w)dw.
(13.34)
2π i L v − w
Obviously, the function f (v) is analytic everywhere outside L, it has asymptotics 0 at
inﬁnity and it can be analytically continued across the border of the contour L. This gives

1
1
f (v) =
g(w)dw + g(v),
(13.35)
2πi L v − w
for v inside L. Apparently the integral expression on the r.h.s. is analytic inside the contour L.
Hence the total r.h.s., i.e. the analytically continued function f (v), has the same singularities
as g(v) at all points in the set S. To summarize, f (v) is deﬁned on the entire complex plane,
it has asymptotics 0 and shares the same singularities with g(v) at the set S.
If we use g(v) = log A(v), S is the set of singularities {v j | j = 1, ..., m} ∪ {−iτ }, and L
is the path surrounding S (see Fig.13.9) then f (v) as deﬁned above is a function with the
same analyticity properties as
log

q(v)
.
(v + iτ ) N /2

(13.36)

From this follows immediately that
f (v) = log

q(v)
,
(v + iτ ) N /2

(13.37)

which is proved by noting the three properties for the difference function of l.h.s. and r.h.s.:
r analyticity on the complex plane with a possible exception on the set S,
r continuity on the set S, because of cancellation of all singularities (⇒ analyticity everywhere),
r zero asymptotics (⇒ boundedness ⇒ constant due to Liouville’s theorem ⇒ constant = 0).

502

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

Because of (13.33) we have a linear integral representation of log q(v) in terms of log A(v).
Due to the deﬁnition (13.29) the function log a(v) is a linear combination of log q and
explicitly known functions. Hence we ﬁnd

13.2.2 Integral expressions for the eigenvalue I
In (13.38) and (13.40) we have found integral equations determining the function a for
ﬁnite and inﬁnite Trotter number N , respectively. These equations are useful if and only if
we manage to extract the eigenvalue function (13.24) in terms of a or A. In the following
paragraphs we want to show how to do this.
From (13.24) we see that (v) is a rational function, and courtesy of the BA equations
without poles. Hence, (v) is a polynomial of degree N . Any polynomial is determined by its
zeroes and the asymptotic behaviour, i.e. the coefﬁcient of the leading monomial. The zeroes
of (v) = λ1 (v) + λ2 (v) are ‘additional’ solutions to the equation a(v) = λ1 (v)/λ2 (v) =
−1, i.e. solutions to the BA equations or zeroes of A(v) = 1 + a(v) that do not coincide
with BA roots! These zeroes are so-called hole-type solutions to the BA equations which
we label by wl , l = 1, . . . , N . These zeroes are located in the complex plane close to the
axes with imaginary parts ±2, see zeroes in Fig. 13.9 depicted by . In terms of wl the
function (v) reads

Formulas (13.46) and (13.40) are the basis of an efﬁcient analytical and numerical treatment

equations that are somewhat more convenient for this purpose, especially for magnetic ﬁelds
close to 0.

For many purposes it turns out to be advantageous to perform a partial ‘particle-hole’
transformation of the function a(v) on the axis Im(v) = +1 only. Replacing log A = log A +
log a on the upper part of L in (13.40) leads to an equation involving convolution type
integrals with log A, log A and log a. This equation can be resolved explicitly for log a
by straightforward calculations. We will however skip these as in subsection 13.2.3 an
alternative method of derivation of this set of NLIEs will be given.

13.2.3 Derivation of non-linear integral equations II
Here we want to describe another method for deriving the integral equations based on
solutions to functional equations. If we deﬁne functions q ± (v) by


q + (v) =
(v − vk+ ), q − (v) =
(v − vk− ),
(13.50)
vk+

vk−

where vk± are the zeroes of A(v) with imaginary parts close to ±2, respectively, then we
can write down the explicit factorization of A and A
 q + (v)q − (v)q(v)

A(v) = 1 + eβh
,
φ(v + i)q(v − 2i)

 q + (v)q − (v)q(v)
A(v) = 1 + e−βh
.
φ(v − i)q(v + 2i)

(13.51)

From this set of equations we will derive explicit expressions for q(v) in terms of the
functions A(v) and A(v). At ﬁrst glance such a task looks impossible since the functions
q± (v) are unknown and the above set of equations seems underdetermined. However, this
gap is ﬁlled by use of suitable additional analyticity properties of the involved functions,
namely q + (v), q(v), and q − (v) having zeroes with imaginary parts close to +2, 0, and −2,
respectively.
We transform the multiplicative functional equations (13.51) into additive form by taking
the logarithm. Subsequently we take the derivative, so the additive form of the functional
equations is kept, but each of the individual terms is a function with zero asymptotics and
hence admits the Fourier transform for integration contours with real part ranging from
−∞ to +∞. As the Fourier transform of a function with shifted argument is identical to
the ‘old’ Fourier transform times a known coefﬁcient we obtain algebraic equations for the
Fourier coefﬁcients of the functions involved.

13.2 The Heisenberg chain

For deﬁniteness, let us denote the Fourier pair for a function f (v) by
 ∞
1
FTk [ f ] =
f (v)e−ikv dv,
2π −∞
 ∞
FTk [ f ] eikv dk,
f (v) =

505

(13.52)

−∞

i.e. starting with a function f (v) we obtain the Fourier transform FTk [ f ] for which the
inverse transform reproduces f (v). We note that in our applications f (v) is often analytic,
so the integration contour may differ from the real axis, but still gives the same integral
thanks to Cauchy’s theorem as long as the real part of the contour ranges from −∞ to +∞.
If the function f (v) possesses different ‘analyticity strips’ that are separated by singularities,
then there exist Fourier transforms that are well-deﬁned in each strip, but differ for different
strips.
For the convolution f ∗ g of functions f and g
 ∞
f (v − w)g(w)dw
(13.53)
f ∗ g(v) :=
−∞

we note the ‘theorem’
FTk [ f ∗ g] = 2π FTk [ f ] FTk [g] .

(13.54)

In most cases we will apply the Fourier transform to logarithmic derivatives of functions
like q± , q, A . . . . For any function h(v) we therefore introduce the shorthand notation


d
log h(v) ,
(13.55)
h k := FTk
dv
i.e. h k is the Fourier transform of the logarithmic derivative of h(v).
As an explicit example we treat the case of a simple linear function p(v)
p(v) := v − v0 ,

1
d
log p(v) =

dv
v − v0

(13.56)

For this function the Fourier integral can be evaluated explicitly by closing the integration
contour in the lower (upper) half-plane for positive (negative) values of the argument k. By
use of Cauchy’s theorem we then ﬁnd

0,
Im(v0 ) > 0,

−ie

+ie−ikv0 , Im(v0 ) > 0,

In the general case where the Fourier transform is computed for an integration path L
different from the real axis the above result still holds if the condition ‘Im(v0 ) > (<) 0’ is
replaced by ‘v0 above (below) L’.

506

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

Before tackling (13.51) we note the lemma
FTk [ f (v − v0 )] = e−ikv0 FTk [ f (v)]

(13.58)

relating the two Fourier integrals provided that the integration contour L and L − v0 belong
to the same analyticity strip.
We apply the Fourier transform to the logarithmic derivative of (13.51) with a contour
L(L) along a straight line slightly below (above) the real axis for the function A (A).
Let us study the case k > 0 ﬁrst. We note for the ﬁrst equation (with path L) that the
transforms corresponding to q + (v), q(v), and φ(v − i) vanish, because the zeroes of these
functions are located above L. Likewise for the second equation (with path L) the transforms
corresponding to q + (v) and q(v − 2i) vanish. We keep the remaining terms where the
transforms corresponding to q(v + 2i) and φ(v + i), q(v − 2i) are reduced to those of q(v)
and φ(v) by virtue of (13.58).
k>0

Ak = qk− − e−2k qk
Ak = −e−k φk + qk− + qk
Ak − Ak = e−k φk − (1 + e−2k )qk .

(13.59)

Applying an analogous reasoning to the case k < 0 we ﬁnally arrive at
k<0

Ak = −ek φk + qk+ + qk ,
Ak = qk+ − e2k qk
Ak − Ak = −ek φk + (1 + e2k )qk .

(13.60)

These equations are explicit expressions for q(v). Note however, that the notation used
above is slightly ambiguous. We have used the same symbol qk for two different functions:
the Fourier transforms of the logarithmic derivative of q(v) in the upper and the lower halfplane, respectively. For practical calculations this does not matter as for q(v) in the upper
(lower) half-plane, the Fourier coefﬁcient vanishes for k < 0 (k > 0). A non-vanishing
Fourier coefﬁcient is obtained for k > 0 (k < 0) and is then identical to qk . In other words,
qk for k > 0 (k < 0) is the only non-vanishing Fourier coefﬁcient for q(v) in the upper
(lower) half-plane.
From (13.29) we ﬁnd an explicit expression for the Fourier coefﬁcient of a(v) and a(v)
in terms of q(v):

The equation (13.65) is almost in its desired form. After integrating (13.65) with respect
to v we obtain a very similar equation where the primes are dropped and the ﬁrst term
on the r.h.s. is replaced by its integral plus an integration constant which has to be ﬁxed.
This constant is determined in the limit v → ∞ for which the integral equation turns into
an algebraic equation for the asymptotics of log a and log A, log A. These asymptotics
are known from (13.29) and are a = exp(βh), A = 1 + exp(βh), and A = 1 + exp(−βh)
yielding the integration constant βh/2. Finally, taking the limit N → ∞ and noting that
τ = β/N we ﬁnd
log a(v) = +

(13.67)

This integral equation was derived for arguments v with imaginary part between +2 and −2,
the integration contours in the convolutions with log A and log A being L and L, i.e. straight
lines below and above the real axis, respectively. An integral expression for the function
log a is easily obtained as a and a are related in a simple way by virtue of (13.47).

13.2.4 Integral expressions for the eigenvalue II

q(v)
q(v − 2i)
A(v).
= φ(v + i)
q(v)

(v) = φ(v − i)

(13.69)

Either of these expressions is suitable for an explicit calculation of  by use of the Fourier
transforms of the logarithmic derivatives of the respective functions involved. The computations are done most elegantly if both expressions are combined yielding the following
functional equation
(v + i)(v − i) = φ(v − 2i)φ(v + 2i)A(v − i)A(v + i),

(13.70)

where the functions on the r.h.s. are known functions. The functional equation admits a
unique solution for 
 ∞
1
log (v) = −βe0 (v) +
e(v − w) log[A(w − i)A(w + i)]dw,
(13.71)
2π −∞
where the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. e0 (v) is a convolution of e with log φ similar to the second
term. We do not give the explicit expression of e0 (v) as we are interested in the free energy
(13.12). Hence e0 (v = 0) is the groundstate energy of the Heisenberg chain with magnetic
ﬁeld h = 0. Any T and h dependence enters only in the second term in (13.71).
The NLIEs (13.67,13.68) and the expression (13.71) for the eigenvalue (v) are the
main result of this chapter and completely determine the thermoynamics of the spin- 12
Heisenberg chain.
Considering the historical developement of the method described above, we note that
NLIEs very similar to (13.40) were derived for the row-to-row transfer matrix in [256,257].
These equations were then generalized to the related cases of QTMs (staggered transfer
matrices) of the Heisenberg and RSOS chains [253,254] and the sine-Gordon model [100].
Very recently [440], in addition to the TBA approach (Chapter 5) and the QTM approach
(this Section) a third formulation of the thermodynamics of the Heisenberg chain has been
developed (see Appendix 13.B). At the heart of this formulation is a single NLIE with a
structure very different from that of the two sets of NLIEs discussed above. Nevertheless, this
new equation has been derived from the ‘old’ NLIEs [440, 443] and is certainly equivalent
to them. (For an algebraic derivation of the TBA equations and the ‘third formulation’ of the
thermodynamics see Appendices 13.A and 13.B.) In the ﬁrst applications of the new NLIE,
numerical calculations of the free energy have been performed with excellent agreement
with the ‘Yang-Yang’ TBA and QTM results. Also, analytical high temperature expansions
up to 100th order (!) have been carried out on the basis of the new formulation [441]. The
‘third formulation’ of thermodynamics of integrable quantum chains has been extended

13.3 Shastry’s model as a classical analogue of the 1d Hubbard model
Here we recall the essential properties of the Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model and its
exactly solvable classical counterpart in 2d. The Hubbard model describes a lattice fermion
system with electron-hopping term and on-site Coulomb repulsion with Hamiltonian

The external ﬁeld term Hexternal = − i [µ(n i,↑ + n i,↓ ) + B(n i,↑ − n i,↓ )] will be omitted for
the time being. According to [393], it is easier to ﬁnd a classical analogue after performing
the Jordan-Wigner transformation for electrons in 1d. The resulting spin Hamiltonian is

where L denotes the length of the chain. Note that we are now imposing periodic boundary
conditions for the spin system (σ1,a = σ L+1,a for a = ↑, ↓). This does not correspond to periodic boundary conditions for the underlying electron system. The differences in boundary
conditions, however, will not affect thermodynamic quantities like the speciﬁc heat.
For the classical counterpart in two dimensions (see Chapter 12) we considered a doublelayer square lattice, consisting of ↑- and ↓-sublattices. Each local Hilbert space corresponding to a particular site of the lattice is indexed by an integer i, the sublattice is speciﬁed
by the additional a = ↑, ↓. For vanishing on-site interaction (U = 0) the R-matrix is given
by the product of vertex weights of the free-fermion six vertex model, r (λ) = r↑ (λ)r↓ (λ),
where
ra (λ) =

Hence r acts non-trivially in the product of local Hilbert spaces corresponding to sites 1
and 2.
Taking account of a non-vanishing U as done in [393] the following local vertex weights
are found [393], (12.110)

(13.75)

The L-operator is related to Ř by (13.1). As shown in Appendix 12.A this R-matrix satisﬁes
the Yang-Baxter relation for triple R matrices. The commutativity of the row-to-row transfer
matrix is a direct consequence.

510

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

The R matrix and H are related by an expansion in small spectral parameters,
R1,2 (λ, µ) = P[1 + (λ − µ)H1,2 ] + O(λ2 , λµ, µ2 ),

(13.76)

where P denotes the permutation operator, P(x ⊗ y) = y ⊗ x. Note that there is a minus
sign change in (13.76) in comparison to (13.3). We therefore follow Section 13.1 as closely
as possible with the ﬁnal replacement of the parameter τ by −τ . Alternatively we may
replace U by −U , i.e. we study H (−U ) which is equivalent to −H (+U ) upon a unitary
transformation of the type of a sublattice gauge transformation, ci,a → (−1)i ci,a . Hence we
ﬁnd
Z = lim Tr e−β H (U ) = lim Tr eβ H (−U ) .

In the next section we will derive the BA equations by use of several of the techniques
developed in Chapter 12 for the homogeneous row-to-row transfer matrix.

13.4 Diagonalization of the quantum transfer matrix
In this section we will diagonalize the QTM by the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method
(QISM). At ﬁrst glance, the diagonalization scheme for the QTM looks quite different from
the row-to-row case. The QTM has a complicated inhomogeneous structure, seemingly
demanding much more effort. Fortunately, this is not true. The crucial observation is, as
remarked in the previous section, that QTMs share the same intertwining operator with the
row-to-row transfer matrices. In view of the QISM, this results in identical operator algebras
allowing for the diagonalization of the trace of the monodromy matrix. We note that we
adopt periodic or twisted boundary conditions in the Trotter direction in order to account
for the external magnetic ﬁeld B and chemical potential µ, see the end of Section 13.1.
Thus, the eigenvalue equation of the QTM involves the same combinations of ‘dressing
functions’ in the terminology of the analytic Bethe ansatz as in the row-to-row case. One
only has to replace the vacuum expectation values taking account of the inhomogeneity in
the quantum space.
We deﬁne state vectors |i , i = 1, · · · , 4 by
|1 = |+, − ,

|2 = |+, + ,

|3 = |−, − ,

|4 = |−, + .

external magnetic ﬁeld. These ﬁelds merely lead to trivial modiﬁcations in  due to twisted
boundary conditions for the QTM as in Refs. [101, 230, 231, 254].

Here some remarks are in order:
(i) We have checked (13.86) for the largest eigenvalue against results from numerical diagonalizations of ﬁnite systems up to size N = 6. The leading state lies in the sector m = N ,  = N /2.
For the repulsive case and µ = B = 0, all z j ’s are on the imaginary axis, while all wα ’s are real,
cf. ﬁgures 13.10 and 13.11.
(ii) The free-fermion partition function is recovered in the limit U → 0.

and different temperatures τ = β/N = 0.05, 0.1, 1. For the sake of clarity we have omitted the axes
labels. The origin corresponds to 0, and marks are placed at integer values times i. In all three cases
there are 16 parameters z j , however only a subset is visible within the displayed window of absolute
values less than 10. Note that for τ = 0.05 all values of z j are larger than 1, for τ = 0.1 (1) two (six)
values of z j are less than 1.
(iii) Starting from another vacuum | = |2, 3, · · · , one obtains a different expression for (λ).
The resultant one is actually identical to (13.83) after negating U and exchanging B ↔ µ.
This alternative formulation is in fact equivalent to (13.83) thanks to a partial particle-hole
transformation.

The solution to the Bethe ansatz equations (13.88) corresponding to the largest eigenvalue
shows a characteristic temperature dependence. For rather large values of the temperature
T (i.e. small values of τ = β/N ) all z j lie on the imaginary axis and have absolute values
larger than 1. Upon lowering T (i.e. increasing τ ) the parameters z j decrease and converge
towards the origin, see ﬁgure 13.10. In particular, at low temperatures a certain number of
the z j ’s have absolute values less than 1. A similar behaviour is shown by the wα parameters
on the real axis, see ﬁgure 13.11. We note that the motion of the z j parameters has profound
consequences. In the next section we will reparametrise the z j ’s in terms of s j parameters
by use of a function s(z) that is not one-to-one, i.e. z(s) is double valued. Upon the action
of s(z), parameters z on the imaginary axis with |z| > 1 and those with |z| < 1 are mapped

onto the same range of the real axis with |s| > 1. In this sense the motion of z j parameters
through the points ±i corresponds to a change of the new s j from the ﬁrst branch to the
second branch (with a branch cut from −1 to +1). The set of parameters wα will be kept
and there is no branch cut in the w-plane.

13.5 Associated auxiliary problem of difference type
The thermodynamical information on the system is encoded in the solution to the Bethe
ansatz equations (13.88) in the limit N → ∞. For ﬁnite N it is possible to solve the
Bethe ansatz equations numerically. However, for large N it is quite complicated to ﬁnd
the numerical solution even for the ground state. Furthermore, in the Trotter limit N → ∞
the roots {vk , wk } accumulate at inﬁnity. This is similar to other models (Heisenberg model,
t - J model) where the solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations of the QTM coalesce at the
origin [100, 230–232, 253, 254]. This represents the main problem in analyzing the limit
N → ∞ directly on the basis of the Bethe ansatz equations. To overcome this difﬁculty one

13.5 Associated auxiliary problem of difference type

can express the solution of the Bethe ansatz equations by a system of non-linear integral
equations in analogy with our treatment of the Heisenberg chain in Section 13.2.
The ﬁrst problem to be overcome is the complicated structure of the Bethe ansatz equations (13.88). Introducing variables

Equations (13.90), (13.91) would be equivalent to (13.88) if the functions φ(s) and z(s)
were single-valued. However, these functions possess two branches.
The standard (‘ﬁrst’) branch of z(s) is deﬁned by requiring that z(s) ! 2is for large
values of s, with a branch cut along [−1, 1] (corresponding to values of z on the unit circle.)
Hence the ﬁrst branch of z(s) maps the complex plane without [−1, 1] onto the region of
the complex plane outside the unit circle. Conversely the second branch of z(s) maps the
complex plane without [−1, 1] onto the inner region of the unit circle.
Along the branch cut we ﬁnd
3
z(x ± i0) = ix ∓ 1 − x 2 ,
x ∈ [−1, 1].
(13.95)
We will not often refer to the second branch of z(s). We emphasize that z(s) is in no way
related to the functions z ± deﬁned in (13.85).
To summarize: equations (13.90), (13.91) are equivalent to (13.88) only if we specify on
which Riemann sheet each parameter s j in (13.90) lies. In ﬁgure 13.10 (and ﬁgure 13.11)
we plot solutions z j (and wα ) to (13.88) for three typical cases at high, moderate, and
low temperatures. At high temperatures all z j have absolute values larger than 1 with the
corresponding parameters s j lying on the ﬁrst sheet, cf. ﬁgure 13.12 where the positions
of s j on the ﬁrst sheet are depicted by squares. At low temperatures most of the z j ’s have
absolute values larger than 1, but there are some z j with absolute values less than 1. The

integer values. In all three cases there are 16 parameters s j , however only a subset is visible within
the displayed window of absolute values less than 10. The depicted results correspond to those in
ﬁgure 13.10 via the relation (13.89). Parameters s j corresponding to z j ’s with absolute values larger
(smaller) than 1 are depicted by squares (diamonds). For the sake of clarity the symbols for s j ’s lying
on the second sheet are plotted slightly below the axis.

corresponding parameters s j lie on the ﬁrst as well as the second sheet, cf. ﬁgure 13.12
where the positions of s j ’s that lie on the second sheet are depicted by diamonds.
We note that for N → ∞ there are inﬁnitely many rapidities on the ﬁrst (upper) sheet
and ﬁnitely many on the second (lower) sheet. The number of rapidities on the second sheet
is increasing with decreasing temperature, resulting in a ﬂow from the ﬁrst to the second
sheet, see ﬁgure 13.13.
The function φ(s) deﬁned in (13.92) has two branches as well, which we denote by φ + (s)
and φ − (s), respectively. The function φ + (s) has a zero (pole) of order N /2 at the point s0
(−s0 ) deﬁned by
z(s0 ) := z − (w),

(2is0 ! N /β for large N ).

(13.96)

On the other hand, φ − (s) has a zero (pole) of order N /2 at the point −s0 + iU/2 (s0 − iU/2).

(13.97)

At this point a comment on the difference type property of (13.91) is in order. These
equations are ‘Bethe ansatz equation compatible’ with an auxiliary system in the following
sense. Consider the auxiliary function
aux (s) := λ1 (s) + λ2 (s) + λ3 (s) + λ4 (s),

(13.98)

where the λ j functions are deﬁned by
φ(s − iU/4)
q2 (s − iU/2)
, λ2 (s) := e2βµ
,
q1 (s − iU/4)
q2 (s)q1 (s − iU/4)
q2 (s + iU/2)
1
, λ4 (s) := eβ(µ−B)
.
λ3 (s) :=
q2 (s)q1 (s + iU/4)
φ(s + iU/4) q1 (s + iU/4)

λ1 (s) := eβ(µ+B)

(13.99)

In this case, the condition of analyticity of aux (s), i.e. the absence of poles, leads to (13.90),
(13.91), which are the Bethe ansatz equations of the eigenvalue (λ) of the original QTM!
An important qualitative difference between (λ) and aux (s) is that while (λ) is analytic
everywhere, i.e. on all branches, aux (s) is analytic on the ﬁrst (standard) branch, but may
have singularities on the other (three) branches.
Let us illustrate this point by considering the ﬁrst set of the Bethe ansatz equations
(13.90). The latter set of equations arises from requiring that the zeroes s j + iU/4 in the
denominators of λ1 and λ2 are cancelled in the sum λ1 + λ2 (or equivalently that the zeroes
s j − iU/4 in the denominators of λ3 and λ4 are cancelled in the sum λ3 + λ4 ):
λ1 (s j + iU/4)
= −1.
λ2 (s j + iU/4)

(13.100)

This condition is satisﬁed in the limit N → ∞ for an inﬁnite number of rapidities on the
ﬁrst branch of the function λ1 /λ2 , and for a ﬁnite number of rapidities on the second branch,
see ﬁgure 13.13.
In ﬁgure 13.14 we show the distribution of zeroes, poles and the branch cut for the function
(λ1 + λ2 )(s) at a relatively high temperature. Here all rapidities s j satisfy Eqn. (13.100) on
the ﬁrst branch. Hence the cancellation of poles and zeroes happens entirely for the ﬁrst

to the second branch and back is possible. All poles are of simple order except those at iU/4 − s0
and s0 − iU/4 which are of order N /2. The zeroes of the function (on the second branch) are not of
further importance to our analysis. Here, for not too low temperatures, the poles with imaginary part
U/4 occur on the second branch and are completely absent on the ﬁrst branch. If the temperature is
lowered, the poles on the second branch move through the branch cut onto the ﬁrst branch.

branch of (λ1 + λ2 )(s), no cancellation takes place on the second branch. Therefore all poles
with imaginary part U/4 occur on the second branch and are completely absent on the ﬁrst
one. In ﬁgure 13.15 we show the distribution of zeroes, poles and the branch cut for the
function (λ3 + λ4 )(s). Last but not least, we illustrate the distribution of zeroes, poles and
branch cuts for the function (λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 )(s), cf. ﬁgure 13.16. As we have two cuts
of the type discussed above there are in total four branches. We are mostly interested in the
case of the ﬁrst (standard) branch.
As a ﬁnal comment on the singularities of the introduced functions we note that there is
no non-zero winding number of the functions (λ1 + λ2 )(s), (λ3 + λ4 )(s), (λ1 + λ2 + λ3 +
λ4 )(s) around their branch cuts. The reason is simple: the total number of poles on the 1st
branch is equal to N and the asymptotic behaviour of the functions is 1/s N . Of course, for
lower temperatures isolated singularities may change from one branch to the other via the

as well as the emerging singularities.
The construction (13.98), (13.99) is at this point purely mathematical; however, it will

In this section we are concerned with the derivation of well posed integral equations equivalent to the nested Bethe ansatz equations for the largest eigenvalue of the QTM for U > 0.
(The case U < 0 is simply obtained via a particle-hole transformation, see Section 2.2.4.)
We introduce a set of auxiliary functions satisfying a set of closed functional equations
which later on are transformed into integral form.
At ﬁrst glance a treatment strictly following the one for the Heisenberg chain would
appear to be possible [255]. In fact, functions like λ1 (s)/λ2 (s), λ2 (s)/λ3 (s) etc. may lead
to a closed set of equations. However, the analytic properties, i.e. distribution of poles and

branch cuts, are such that the integration contours are no longer straight lines. This causes
severe problems in a numerical study and obstructs the analytical investigation of lowtemperature properties. Some problems in such a direct approach are already encountered
at moderate temperatures in a study of the BA equations for ﬁnite N . In ﬁgure 13.17 the
functions λ1 /λ2 and λ2 /λ3 are shown for argument s(z) + iU/4 (with imaginary z) and
argument s (real), respectively. Note that the phases of these functions are monotonic for
λ1 /λ2 , but non-monotonic for λ2 /λ3 , which in the latter case complicates the determination
of the relevant zeroes. The parameters wα are to be determined from λ2 /λ3 or equivalently
from (λ1 + λ2 )/(λ3 + λ4 ) which shows the advantage of a monotonical varying phase.

(13.102)

The main observation in connection with the functions deﬁned in (13.101) is based on
elementary facts of the theory of complex functions. In particular any analytic function on
the complex plane is entirely determined by its singularities, i.e. poles and branch cuts,
as well as its asymptotic behaviour at inﬁnity. Below we will show that the singularities of log b, log c etc. on the entire complex plane are exhausted by the singularities of
log(1 + b), log(1 + c) etc. in the vicinity of the real axis.2 Furthermore, all functions involved exhibit constant asymptotics for ﬁnite N . Hence there exists a suitable integral representation of log b, log c etc. in terms of log(1 + b), log(1 + c) etc. The latter functions will be
2

The relevant singularities are distributed exactly on the real axis for vanishing external ﬁelds. For this case the subsequent
treatment can be taken literally. For ﬁnite external ﬁelds B, µ, deviations from the real axis occur. The following reasoning still
applies mutatis mutandis.

Quite generally all the above auxiliary functions have a product representation with factors
of the type . . . + l3 + l4 + l1 + l2 + . . . . As a matter of the Bethe ansatz equations the poles
of each l j and l j function in . . . + l3 + l4 + l1 + l2 + . . . are canceled by the neighbouring
terms. Poles can only ‘survive’ if such a string does not begin with l1 or does not end with
l4 . There are extended singularities (cuts) due to the function φ appearing in the deﬁnition
of λ1 and λ4 . Hence all terms l1 + l2 + . . . and . . . + l3 + l4 possess branch cuts along
[−1, 1] + iU/2 and [−1, 1] − iU/2, respectively. Furthermore, terms like . . . + l3 + l4 and
l1 + l2 + . . . have branch cuts along [−1, 1]. However in combinations . . . + l4 + l1 + . . .
the branch cut due to the φ function disappears, because
l4 (s) + l1 (s) = eβ(µ+B)

φ + (s) + φ − (s)
,
q1 (s)

(13.104)

and φ + (s) + φ − (s) is analytic everywhere as a crossing of the line [−1, +1] results into a
simple exchange φ + (s) ↔ φ − (s) leaving the sum invariant.
Inspecting the function λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 more closely we ﬁnd poles of order N /2 at
s0 − iU/4 and iU/4 − s0 where s0 is deﬁned in (13.96). In addition we ﬁnd zeroes and
branch cuts on the lines Im(s) = ±U/4 which we write as

2
+ L − (s + iU/4) + L + (s − iU/4), (13.105)

log[λ1 (s) + λ2 (s) + λ3 (s) + λ4 (s)] ≡s −

where ≡s denotes that left- and right-hand sides have the same singularities on the entire
plane, and L ± are suitable functions possessing the desired singularities and being analytic
otherwise. These functions can be constructed quite explicitly by contour integrals of the
type (13.31). The functions L ± are obtained by choosing L around the axes Im(s) = ±U/4
and setting f (v) → L ± (s), A(w) → (λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 )(w) and v − w → s − w ± iU/4.
Alternatively, we can write the functions as L ± = k ◦ l± where the function k and the symbol
◦ are deﬁned below in (13.109), (13.110) and l± (s) = (λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 )(s ± iU/4). Note

however, that we do not need these explicit expressions for our reasoning. From (13.105)
we ﬁnd the following singularities

we ﬁnd the singularities

log B(s) ≡s −L − (s) + rest,
log c(s) − log C(s) ≡s L − (s) − L + (s) + rest,

(13.108)

where ‘rest’ indicates singularities not located on the real axis.
Next we introduce the notation

(g ◦ f )(s) =

for the convolution of two functions g and f with contour L surrounding the real axis at
inﬁnitesimal distance above and below in anticlockwise manner. From Cauchy’s theorem
we ﬁnd for any function f analytic above and below the real axis
(k ◦ f )(x ± i0) = (k ◦ f )(x) + f (x ± i0), where k(s) =

(13.110)

and x is real (see also (13.34) and (13.35)). For further convenience we introduce the

(13.112)

524

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

Upon comparing (13.108), (13.112) we conclude
log b(s) = K 2 ◦ log B + K 1 ◦ (log c − log C) + const,

(13.113)

as both sides are complex functions with identical singularities. For a proof of the identity
we consider the difference function which is entire, i.e. analytic on the entire complex
plane. Furthermore the difference function is bounded, hence it is constant. The constant is
computed from considering the asymptotic behaviour at s → ∞. The function b(s) (13.101)
due to (13.102) has the limiting behaviour of 1/[e2β B φ + (s)φ − (s)] which simply gives e−2β B .
As the integrals on the r.h.s. of the last equation turn to 0 we have
const = −2β B.

N
log[λ3 (s) + λ4 (s)] ≡s − log φ(s + iU/4) − log(s + s0 + iU/4)

(13.116)

log[λ1 (s) + λ2 (s)] ≡s −

with a suitable function L(s). From this we ﬁnd the singularities
log t(s) ≡s

N
log

2
s + s0 − iU/2

log B(s) + log T(s) ≡s −L(s) + rest,

(13.117)

where ‘rest’ again indicates singularities not located on the real axis. Hence we conclude
log t(s) = β(µ + B) +

N
s + s0
log
+ log φ(s) − K 1 ◦ (log B + log T).
2
s + s0 − iU/2
(13.118)

The constant on the r.h.s. has been determined similarly to above from the limit of t(s)
which is straightforwardly found from (13.99) to be exp(β(µ + B)).
Next we deform the integration contour for log B in (13.118) from a narrow loop around
the real axis to a wide loop consisting of the two horizontal lines Im(s) = ±α, with 0 <
α ≤ U/4. The corresponding convolution is denoted by ‘

and the additional contribution is due to the residue of K 1 , see (13.110). Taking into account
(13.101, 13.115) we ﬁnd
log c = log t − log B,

 log T =  log C,

(13.120)

where  f (x) = f (x + i0) − f (x − i0) denotes the discontinuity along the real axis. Therefore, (13.118) turns into

log c = −βU/2 + β(µ + B) + log φ − K 1

log c = −βU/2 − β(µ + B) − log φ + K

where the equation for log c has been derived in analogy to the one for log c, and for N → ∞
the function φ takes the simpliﬁed form

(13.123)
log φ(s) = −2βis 1 − 1/s 2 .
yielding at the branch cut

3
log φ(x ± i0) = ±2β 1 − x 2 ,

x ∈ [−1, 1].

(13.124)

We want to point out that the function b will be evaluated on the lines Im(s) = ±α (notably
with α = U/4). The functions c and c need only be evaluated on the real axis inﬁnitesimally
above and below the interval [−1, 1]. Also the convolutions involving the ‘c functions’ in
(13.122) can be restricted to a contour surrounding [−1, 1] as these functions are analytic
outside.
Finally, we want to comment on the structure of the equations determining the thermodynamical properties of the Hubbard model. In contrast to long-range interaction systems [161, 240] we have to solve a set of subsidiary equations (13.122) for the ‘distribution
functions’ b, c, and c before evaluating the free energy (13.154). Obviously, the dynamics
of the elementary excitations of the nearest-neighbour systems are more involved than those
of [161, 240] which may be viewed as ‘free particles with exclusion statistics’.

Cauchy integral of the function

(13.125)
f (s) = log z(s) log (1 + l4 /l3 (s)) ,

526

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

where the s j are precisely the zeroes of both branches of (1 + l4 /l3 (s)) on or close to the
real axis. Therefore, we use a contour L0 surrounding the s j in anticlockwise manner.
The s j are not located on the branch cut of log z(s) from −1 to 1, hence L0 consists
of two disconnected parts. (For vanishing external ﬁelds these contours are loops around
] − ∞, −1] and [1, ∞[, respectively. In the general case they are appropriately deformed.)
For not too low temperatures the z j corresponding to a particular s j are calculated by use
of the ﬁrst branch of log z(s). This is no longer possible at lower temperatures, so for the
general case we must write

where the ﬁrst and second term on the right hand side, 1 and 2 , will be separately

13.7.1 First integral expression in terms of auxiliary functions
The function l4 (s)/l3 (s) for s → ∞ behaves like a rational function with ﬁnite limiting value
exp(β(µ − B)) and next-leading asymptotics of order O(1/s). As we also have z(s) of order
O(s) we ﬁnd the asymptotics of f (s) as O(log s/s 2 ). Therefore we are allowed to add two
large ‘semi-circles’ to the contour L0 without changing the integral expression of 1 . Next
we deform the integration contour by leaving the value of the integral unchanged. Due to
Cauchy’s theorem we may do so as long as the contour is not moved over singularities of
f (s) which result from a branch cut along the interval [−1, +1] (depicted by a dashed line
in ﬁgure 13.18), and poles resulting from zeroes and poles of the expression 1 + l4 /l3 (s)
(depicted by open circles and crosses). Ultimately we ﬁnd a contour consisting of three
separate parts, cf. ﬁgure 13.19. Contour (a) consists of a path (a1 ) from −∞ to −1, a loop
(a2 ) around the interval [−1, +1] and a path (a3 ) back to −∞.
Note that (a1 ) and (a3 ) are inverse to each other, but do not lead to a cancellation in the
integral as the integrand shows a jump from (a1 ) to (a3 ), because log z(s) jumps by −2π i.

Here we like to point out that a similar expression will be encountered below where the

these terms).

a contour with three separate parts shown in ﬁgure 13.23. The contribution of the ﬁrst and
third path to the integral in (13.136) can be explicitly given in terms of the surrounded
poles. The contribution of the second path being identical to L + iU/2 (in reversed sense)
can be reformulated by a shift of the variable of integration from s to s + iU/2 leading to
a replacement of the l j functions by l j functions:

vanishes like O(log R/R 2 ). We also add a path depicted by a thin solid line to the upper part of the
complex plane. This path has no contribution as it can be closed to a point without touching any of
the singularities. Finally, we deform the contour by letting the lower part consisting of the semi-circle

For the functions (13.101) evaluated on the contours involved in (13.122), (13.154) we use
the notation b± , c± and c±
b± (x) = b(x ± iU/4),

c± (x) = c(x ± i 0),

c± (x) = c(x ± i 0).

(13.156)

Furthermore, we introduce the following relations:
B± := 1 + b± ,

B± := 1 + 1/b± ,

C± := 1 + c± ,

C± := 1 + c± ,

 log C := log(C+ /C− ),

 log C := log(C+ /C− ),

(13.157)
etc.

Thus (13.122) is written in the form
log b+ = −2β B − K 2,0 ∗ log B+ + K 2,U/2 ∗ log B− − K 1,0 ∗  log(c/C),
log b− = −2β B − K 2,−U/2 ∗ log B+ + K 2,0 ∗ log B− − K 1,−U/2 ∗  log(c/C),
log c± = c± + K 1,−U/2 ∗ log B+ − K 1,0 ∗ log B− + K 1,−U/4 ∗  log C ± 12  log C,

log c± =  c − K 1,0 ∗ log B+ + K 1,U/2 ∗ log B− − K 1,U/4 ∗  log C ± 12  log C,

where
c± = −βU/2 + β(µ + B) + log φ±0 ,
±

 c = −βU/2 − β(µ + B) − log φ±0 ,

(13.159)

and we have used the notation f α for a function f with shift of the argument by iα
f α (x) = f (x + iα),
and K n,α := (K n )α where the ﬁrst index speciﬁes the function and the second one speciﬁes
the shift of the argument. In particular φ±0 denotes the function φ evaluated on the real axis
from above/below. Notice that the convolutions of K 1,±U/4 with  log C and  log C are
determined by Cauchy’s principal value. Remember that these functions vanish outside the
interval [−1, 1].
Similarly, from (13.142) and (13.154) we obtain two different relations for the eigenvalue

The branch of K is ﬁxed by the requirement K(s) ! 1/(2π is) for large s and Kα is the
related function with shifted argument. By means of the relation
 log c = − log φ +  log C,

(13.163)

the ﬁrst equation of (13.158) turns into
log b+ = b+ − K 2,0 ∗ log B+ + K 2,U/2 ∗ log B− − K 1,0 ∗  log(C/C),
log b− = b− − K 2,−U/2 ∗ log B+ + K 2,0 ∗ log B− − K 1,−U/2 ∗  log(C/C),

where
b+ = −βU − 2β B + log φU/4 − log φ−U/4 ,
b− = −βU − 2β B + log φ−U/4 − log φ−3U/4 .

(13.165)

For the sake of completeness rather than for further applications we mention the results
for ﬁnite Trotter number N . All equations above hold true after the replacement of the

where s0 is deﬁned in (13.96). These relations for ﬁnite Trotter number N have been used
for a comparison of the results of the integral equations with a direct treatment based on
the Bethe ansatz equations of Sections 13.4 and 13.5. Thus it was possible to ensure the
accuracy (10−6 ) of our numerics based on iterations and fast Fourier transform.
Next we present our numerical results for various physical quantities and discuss them in
terms of the elementary spin and charge excitations, i.e. ‘spinons’ and ‘holons’ (plus gapped
excitations based on ‘doubly occupied sites’). Note that at half-ﬁlling the system possesses
a charge gap such that the holons do not contribute at low temperatures. Furthermore, the
hopping integral of the kinetic energy has been set to t = 1.
In ﬁgure 13.26 the temperature dependence of the speciﬁc heat is shown for densities
n = 1, 0.8, and 0.5. For half-ﬁlling (n = 1.0) the speciﬁc heat shows one pronounced temperature maximum for lower values of the interaction U . For stronger U this maximum
splits into a lower and a higher temperature maximum which are due to spin and (gapped)

charge excitations, respectively. (These ﬁndings agree largely with those of [397].) The
picture remains qualitatively true for small dopings (n = 0.8), however now the lower temperature peak receives contributions by gapless charge excitations, hence some weight is
shifted from higher to lower temperatures. The situation changes quite drastically for ﬁllings n ≈ 0.5. Here a pronounced maximum in the speciﬁc heat is located at a temperature
of about T ≈ 0.6 which seems rather insensitive to the interaction. This is explained by
the irrelevance of the onsite interaction at sufﬁciently large temperatures, because of the
low-particle density. In addition, we ﬁnd a maximum at very low temperatures which depends very sensitively on U as well as on the particle density n. In order to clarify the
origin of this additional structure the variation of the speciﬁc heat with n is shown in ﬁgure 13.27 for U = 8. Decreasing the particle density n from half-ﬁlling (n = 1) to lower
values (n ≈ 0.8) the lower-temperature maximum increases. This picture is changed drastically below n  0.8. Here the lower-temperature maximum and its location are suppressed
for lower n and a shoulder at a slightly higher temperature develops into a clear maximum.
This new structure in the speciﬁc heat is located at about T ≈ 0.6 and quite independent
of U as already mentioned. We interpret this maximum to be of ‘charge’ type. The complex behaviour at intermediate densities 0.5  n  0.7 is due to a crossover of the ‘spin’
and ‘charge’ maxima, see also ﬁgure 13.32. For densities n ≈ 1 the ‘spin’ maximum is
located at ﬁnite temperature with ﬁnite height whereas the ‘charge’ maximum is located
at very low temperature with small height. For densities close to n ≈ 0 the situation is
reversed.
In ﬁgure 13.28 and ﬁgure 13.29 the magnetic susceptibility χ is presented. Again we begin our discussion with the half-ﬁlled case which is known to correspond to the Heisenberg
spin chain with interaction strength of order O(t 2 /U ). Indeed, we observe a Heisenberg-like
temperature dependence of the susceptibility with χmax and Tmax scaling with U and 1/U
in the range of U = 4, . . . , 8. Upon doping this behaviour remains qualitatively and quantitatively unchanged even for n = 0.5. Quite generally, the location Tmax is shifted to lower
temperatures, see ﬁgure 13.28. The maximal value χmax decreases for decreasing particle
density from n = 1 to n ≈ 0.8, cf. ﬁgure 13.29. Below the value n  0.8 the maximum
χmax increases for further decrease of the particle density. This behaviour is qualitatively
explained by partially ﬁlled bands of charge carriers with spin. If the chemical potential
moves away (towards) a band edge, the susceptibility decreases (increases). Somewhere
inbetween the lower and the upper edge the minimal value is taken.
In contrast to χ the charge susceptibility κ (= ∂n/∂µ, i.e. compressibility) shows a more
interesting dependence on the particle density n, see ﬁgure 13.30 and ﬁgure 13.31. At
half-ﬁlling κ shows the expected exponentially activated behaviour in particular κ = 0 for
T = 0 due to the charge gap. For any doping this behaviour is changed completely showing
a ﬁnite value at zero temperature consistent with a partial ﬁlling of the lower Hubbard
band. For density n = 0.5 we observe two different structures at low temperature similar
to the case of the speciﬁc heat. The lower temperature ‘spin’ peak resembles the structure
in the susceptibility χ, whereas the ‘charge’ maximum at slightly higher temperature is
caused by the single-particle motion of the bare electrons. The charge susceptibility has a

singular dependence on doping. The smaller the doping the closer the curves are to the case
n = 1 at high temperatures and the more divergent at lower temperature, see ﬁrst graph of
ﬁgure 13.31. This, of course, is exactly the behaviour of a system exhibiting a Mott-Hubbard
transition at half-ﬁlling.
Our ﬁndings are qualitatively in accordance with the results3 of [241,469] for the dopings
treated therein. In particular for speciﬁc heats, magnetic and charge susceptibilities the results compare well for densities 0.7 ≤ n ≤ 1 and temperatures T ≥ 0.1, giving independent
support to the truncation treatment of the inﬁnitely many NLIEs adopted in [241,469]. Very
recently, an elaborate treatment [442] of the TBA equations of the Hubbard model [435]
yielded extremely satisfactory agreement with the results presented here.
The present approach has the advantage of explicit evaluations over extremely wide
temperature and density regions. The linear dependence of the speciﬁc heat on T at very low
temperatures, as expected from CFT, is clearly observed. There are additional structures
at lower temperatures and densities especially in the charge susceptibility as mentioned
above. These structures can be interpreted in terms of CFT and elementary excitations with
ﬁnite band width due to the underlying lattice. We conclude that the presented approach
allows for a study of the crossover from the very low temperature (CFT) to the very high
temperature region in an exact way.
In ﬁgure 13.32 we show a separation of the speciﬁc heat into spin and charge components.
This is done in principle on the basis of eigenvalue expressions like (13.160). As motivated
by the study of the strong-coupling limit in Section 13.9.1, contributions by b and c functions
are interpreted as spin and charge contributions, respectively. However, the procedure is not
unique as we have various alternative formulations resulting in different separations. In
particular we like to note the expression (not derived in this presentation)

Fig. 13.32. Separation of speciﬁc heat (solid) in spin (dashed) and charge components (dasheddotted).

where we have applied the separation based on (13.167) to the temperature derivatives of
S and n. Note the functional form of the spin part is rather independent of the doping.
Upon small doping the charge contribution develops a low-temperature shoulder which
disappears for larger dopings. We would like to warn about the formal ‘separation’ of spin
and charge that it may give rise to artiﬁcial results. For instance, at high (low) temperatures
the ‘partial speciﬁc heats’ show negative values whereas the total speciﬁc heat, of course,
is always positive. In Section 13.9.3 the spin-charge separation is treated properly at low
temperatures and arbitrary particle density via an involved interplay of the various degrees
of freedom rather than by a superﬁcial interpretation of formulas.

13.9 Analytical solutions to the integral equations
In the previous sections we have derived non-linear integral equations for the largest eigenvalue of the QTM yielding directly the free energy of the Hubbard model at ﬁnite temperatures T = 1/β. For arbitrary temperatures and densities the integral equations can be
solved only numerically. However, in some limiting cases analytical results can be derived
and relations obtained which permit a comparison to known analytical results.

548

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

13.9.1 Strong-coupling limit
In the strong-coupling limit U → ∞ at half-ﬁlling (µ = 0) the Hubbard model is expected
to reduce to the Heisenberg chain. Indeed, in the strong-coupling limit we ﬁnd that c± and
c± tend to zero, see (13.159), yielding large negative driving terms for c± and c± in (13.158).
Hence all contributions of C± and C± can be dropped on the r.h.s. of (13.164) and (13.122).
The remaining equations from (13.164) read
log b+ = b+ − K 2,0 ∗ log B+ + K 2,U/2 ∗ log B− ,
log b− = b− − K 2,−U/2 ∗ log B+ + K 2,0 ∗ log B− ,

(13.170)

and b± are obtained from (13.165), (13.123), and (13.111) as
b+ = −2β B + 2πβ K 1,0 ,

b− = −2β B + 2πβ K 1,−U/2 ,

(13.171)

and K j,α (x) = K j (x + iα). According to equation (13.160) and dropping an irrelevant
energy shift U/4, the QTM eigenvalue is

(13.172)

where we have replaced (K −U/4 − K U/4 ) by K 1 etc., see (13.161), and (13.111).
In the above equations the limit U → ∞ can be performed explicitly by rescaling the
argument of the auxiliary functions x (→ (U/4)x. To this end we deﬁne

log a+ =  + − K 2,0 ∗ log A+ + K 2,2 ∗ log A− ,
log a− =  − − K 2,−2 ∗ log A+ + K 2,0 ∗ log A− ,

(13.174)

which follows from (13.173) by use of the general relation (K ∗ B)( U4 x) = ( K ∗ A)(x)
for K (x) := U4 K ( U4 x) and A(x) := B( U4 x). In (13.174) the following deﬁnitions were employed

and we have introduced the rescaled (reciprocal) temperature β̃ := (4/U )β and rescaled

13.9 Analytical solutions to the integral equations

By inspection, we see that equations (13.174) for a± are identical to (13.48) for a in the
case of the Heisenberg model if we identify a± (x) = a(x ± i).
Finally, the eigenvalue (13.172) is written as
log  = β̃ h̃/2 + K 1,0 ∗ log A+ |x=0 − K 1,2 ∗ log A− |x=0 ,

(13.176)

which is identical to the Heisenberg model result (13.49) (with v = 0) upon the identiﬁcation
a± (x) = a(x ± i).

13.9.2 Free-Fermion limit
Let us consider the opposite limit U → 0, that is the case of two independent free-fermion
systems. The non-linear integral equations (13.158) simplify to an algebraic set of equations
due to K 1,0 (x) → δ(x), K 1,±U/2 (x) → 0, K 2,α (x) → δ(x) if |α| ≤ U/2, and K 1,±U/4 (x) →

The equations (13.177) can be solved by standard techniques. Alternatively, we may just
use the Bethe ansatz expressions (13.101) and (13.99) that we started with. There, all q1 and
q2 functions cancel or completely factor out as they have the same argument. Hence, only
the ‘trivial’ function φ remains, however, care has to be applied. The relevant arguments
have real part in [−1, 1], but inﬁnitesimal imaginary part of both signs with φ(x − i0) =
1/φ(x + i0). Hence, we obtain the following expressions

This is the result expected from the well-known properties of ideal Fermi gases.

13.9.3 Low-temperature asymptotics
The low-temperature regime is the most interesting limit as here the system shows
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behaviour. We will derive analytic expressions for the thermodynamics within our ﬁrst principles calculations and conﬁrm the ﬁeld theoretical predictions.
In particular we will show how the non-linear integral equations correspond to the known
dressed energy formalism of the Hubbard model. This represents a further and in fact the
most interesting consistency check of the ﬁeld-theoretical picture of the 1d Hubbard chain.
For T = 1/β  1 we can simplify the non-linear integral equations as follows. We adopt
ﬁelds B > 0, µ < 0, such that b− → 0, c± → 0 for β → ∞ with uniform exponential
convergence for all arguments (which is observed numerically). The property c± → 0 is a
consequence of the third equation in (13.158) and (13.159) for negative µ. The behaviour
b− → 0 can be understood from the second equation in (13.158). However, b+ and c± do
not vanish.
We simplify the notation by use of


b(λ) := b (λ),

1/c+ (sin k), for k ∈ − 12 π, + 12 π ,
c(k) :=

where εs0 = 2B, εc0 = −µ − U/2 − B − 2 cos k and all log B− and log C± have been

exponentially small, i.e. corrections are of order O(exp(−const × β)) with some positive
real constant related to the charge gap.

Next we note that the solutions log b and log c to (13.182) are analytic functions of order
O(β), or more precisely log b = −β εs and log c = −β εc with some analytic functions
εs and εc . These functions will be investigated in quite some detail below. They are real,
symmetric functions possessing zeroes ±λ0 , ±k0 and have the properties
εs (λ), εc (k) < 0 for |λ| < λ0 , |k| < k0
εs (λ), εc (k) > 0 for |λ| > λ0 , |k| > k0 .

(13.184)

such that b and c show steep crossover behaviour at low temperatures
|b(λ)|, |c(k)|  1 for |λ| < λ0 , |k| < k0
|b(λ)|, |c(k)|  1 for |λ| > λ0 , |k| > k0 .

(13.185)

As a consequence, the functions log(1 + b) and log(1 + c) are no longer analytic at low
temperature: for arguments smaller than λ0 and k0 these functions are identical to −β εs and
−β εc , for arguments larger than λ0 and k0 the functions are identical to 0! Nevertheless,
the convolutions on the r.h.s. of (13.182) yield (β×) analytic functions.
Linearization
The slopes at the crossover points are steep, allowing for certain approximations to the
integral equations (13.182). We split the contribution of a typical integral term in (13.182)
into three pieces

where in our applications f (x) is an even function like b(λ) or c(k) with log f of order O(β),
x (x0 ) corresponding to λ or k (λ0 or k0 ), respectively. The function K (x  ) is a shorthand
for K j (· · · − λ ) or K j (· · · − sin k  ) cos k  with x  corresponding to λ or k  , respectively.
As the slope (log f ) (x0 ) is of order O(β) and hence sufﬁciently steep at low temperatures,
we can approximate 1/ f (x)(|x| < x0 ) and f (x)(|x| > x0 ) by exp(+(log f ) (x0 )|x ± x0 |) in

however the r.h.s. of (13.199) is more tractable as we have the explicit expression (13.194)
for the bare l 0 functions. Inserting (13.194) (after an exchange of the ‘dummy’ indices i, j)

Here the trivial shift in the energy U/4 is omitted. We thereby conclude that our formalism
completely recovers the correct contribution from spinon and holon excitations in the low
temperature behaviour. This is a manifestation of spin-charge separation due to which each
elementary excitation contributes independently to (13.207) where the velocities vc and vs
typically take different values.

13.9.4 High-temperature limit
Finally, we consider the high-temperature limit T → ∞ with B, U as well as βµ ﬁxed. The
auxiliary functions in (13.158) become constant and convolutions K 2,±U/2 ∗ f , K n,0 ∗ f
with a constant f yield f , but K 1,±U/2 ∗ f yields 0. From (13.158) we ﬁnd
log b± = 0,

log c± = βµ − log 2,

log c± = −βµ − log 2,

(13.208)

and from (13.142)
log  = log(1 + c + c)/c = 2 log(1 + eβµ ).

(13.209)

Thus, the free energy reads

13.10 Conclusions
In this chapter, the QTM formulation of the thermodynamics of 1d quantum systems has
been developed for the Heisenberg model and the Hubbard model. Several quantities of

556

The path integral approach to thermodynamics

physical interest have been evaluated with high numerical precision and various limiting
cases have been studied analytically.
As already noted above, we may consider as one of the most practical advantages of
the present formulation the fact that one only has to deal with a ﬁnite number of unknown
functions and non-linear integral equations among them. This does not only imply convenience, rather it opens a more fundamental understanding related to the particle picture of
1d quantum systems. For the Heisenberg model, the complex conjugate auxiliary functions
play a role which seems to correspond to the elementary spinon excitations [86,133,227]. In
our treatment of the Hubbard model we have shown that the complete thermodynamics are
described by three independent functions b, c, c , physically corresponding to spinons, and
holons in upper and lower Hubbard bands. In the T → 0 limit, these functions are shown
to reduce to energy-density functions (‘dressed energy functions’) for such elementary
excitations.
The two apparently different approaches, the combinatorial TBA and the operator-based
QTM, are not at all independent! In the latter approach there are several quite different ways
of analysis of the eigenvalues of the QTM. This is very well understood for the case of the
Heisenberg model. In the standard (and most economical) way a set of just two coupled
non-linear integral equations (NLIE) is derived. Alternatively, an approach based on the
‘fusion hierarchy’ leads to a set of (generically) inﬁnitely many NLIEs [253, 281] that are
identical to the TBA equations, though a completely different reasoning has to be applied!
For the Hubbard model this explicit relation has not yet been established. It is still an open
problem how to derive the TBA equations of the Hubbard model from the largest eigenvalue
of the QTM. We leave the investigation of these questions as an interesting future problem.
Obviously, our formulation can be extended to the evaluation of the asymptotics of
correlation functions, such as spin-spin correlation lengths etc. For the Heisenberg model
the reader is referred to [253, 254, 258]. In the case of the Hubbard model, there is only
preliminary (numerical) work on correlation lengths at ﬁnite temperature [459] and [465]
(the latter on the basis of the formulation of Section 13.4).

13.A Derivation of TBA equations from fusion hierarchy analysis
In this appendix we present a treatment of the eigenvalue problem (13.23) different from
that in Section 13.2. For all integers j = 0, 1, 2, . . . we deﬁne the objects
T j (v) := q(v − ( j + 1)i)q(v + ( j + 1)i) ·

(13.A.1)

which are analytic functions due to the Bethe ansatz equations (13.28). In order to understand
the cancellation of poles of the individual summands we consider the case j = 1 leading
to the function (indeed identical to (13.24))


q(v − 2i)q(v)
q(v)q(v + 2i)
(13.A.2)
which is a meromorphic function with possible poles at the singularities of the function in
square brackets. These singularities are of two types: either we have singularities due to
the zeroes of q(v ∓ 2i) which are canceled by the prefactor in front of the square bracket,
or the singularities are due to zeroes of q(v) occurring in the ﬁrst as well as second term in
square brackets and cancel each other thanks to the BA equations.
The analyticity of (13.A.1) comes about in a very similar way. The only possible poles
might arise due to zeroes of the functions q(v − ( j + 1)i), q(v − ( j − 1)i), . . . , q(v + ( j −
1)i), q(v + ( j + 1)i) occurring in the denominators of the summands in (13.A.1). Again, the
zeroes of the ﬁrst and the last function are precisely cancelled by the prefactor of the sum in
(13.A.1). The ‘intermediate poles’ cancel pairwise: the function q(v + (2l − j + 1)i) with
l = 0, . . . , j − 1 appears in two terms of (13.A.1), namely the summands corresponding to
labels l and l + 1. The sum of these two terms is identical to the square bracket in (13.A.2)
(with a shift of the argument by (2l − j + 1)i and a common constant factor e(2l− j+1)βh/2 )
and hence the poles cancel as in (13.A.2).

Next, we aim at the derivation of the following (quadratic) functional relation for j =

(13.A.8)

(13.A.3) follows immediately.
We may rewrite (13.A.3) by introducing a function Y j as the ratio of the two terms on
the r.h.s.
Y j (v) =

T j−1 (v)T j+1 (v)

ϕ(v − ( j + 1)i)ϕ(v + ( j + 1)i)

j = 1, 2, . . . .

Hence (13.A.3) takes the form
T j (v + i)T j (v − i) = ϕ(v − ( j + 1)i)ϕ(v + ( j + 1)i)[1 + Y j (v)],

(13.A.10)

for all j = 1, 2, 3, . . . and also j = 0 if we use
T0 (v) = ϕ(v),

Y0 (v) := 0.

(13.A.11)

From (13.A.9) and (13.A.10) we immediately obtain for all j = 1, 2, 3, . . .
Y j (v + i)Y j (v − i) = [1 + Y j−1 (v)][1 + Y j+1 (v)],

(13.A.12)

which is the ﬁnal set of functional relations.
The strategy for solving these relations is: (i) solve (13.A.12) for the functions Y j , (ii) by
use of the solutions Y j solve (13.A.10) for T j . Quite generally, as in Section (13.2) above,
we transform the multiplicative functional equations into (nonlinear) integral equations by
ﬁrst taking the logarithm of the functional equations and then the Fourier transform. In this
manner and as Y j (v), j = 2, 3, . . . has neither pole nor zero in −1 ≤ Imx ≤ 1, we ﬁnd
ln Y j (v) = s ∗ [ln(1 + Y j−1 ) + ln(1 + Y j+1 )], j ≥ 2,

(13.A.13)

where ∗ denotes convolutions and s is the function
s(v) :=

4 cosh π x/2

(13.A.14)

For Y1 (v) the functional equation reads explicitly
Y1 (v − i)Y1 (v + i) = 1 + Y2 (v),

(13.A.15)

and looks slightly simpler, however care has to be taken as Y1 has zeroes at ±(1 − τ )i and
poles at ±(1 + τ )i. We set


tanh π4 (v + (1 − τ )i) N /2
Y1 (v) =

tanh π4 (v + (1 + τ )i)
which deﬁnes a function Ỹ1 (v) that is analytic and non-zero in the domain comprising the
strip −1 ≤Im(v) ≤ +1 and satisﬁes the same inversion identity as Y1 (v)
Ỹ1 (v − i)Ỹ1 (v + i) = 1 + Y2 (v).

(13.A.17)

This equation can now be cast in integral form
ln Ỹ1 (v) = s ∗ ln(1 + Y2 ),

(13.A.18)

and for Y1 we obtain

The equations (13.A.21), (13.A.13), (13.A.22) and (13.A.24) are completely identical to
the TBA equations upon identifying Y j (x) ≡ η j (x).
There are non-linear integral equations for a ﬁnite number of auxiliary functions ‘interpolating’ between 2 and ∞. These equations are particularly useful for the study of higher
spin SU (2) models [424].

13.B Derivation of single integral equation
From (13.A.3) we ﬁnd for j = 1
T1 (v − i)T1 (v + i) = ϕ(v − 2i)ϕ(v + 2i) + ϕ(v)T2 (v),

(13.B.1)

where we have used T0 (v) = ϕ(v). We want to solve for T1 (v)(= (v)) which is a polynomial of degree N . The methods of Section 13.2 and appendix 13.A were based on the
solution of multiplicative functional equations. In Section 13.2 the eigenvalue T1 (v) was
found by an ansatz satisfying the desired asymptotics and the location of zeroes (there are
no singularities).
Here we want to apply a different strategy. We deﬁne a suitable function u 1 (v) as the
ratio of T1 (v) and a polynomial ψ(v) of degree N with zeroes of order N /2 at points ±v0

The Yangian symmetry of the Hubbard model

In this chapter we will reveal another piece of the algebraic structure of the Hubbard
model. As was ﬁrst observed by Uglov and Korepin [462], the Hubbard Hamiltonian
on the inﬁnite line is invariant under the action of the direct sum of two so-called
Yangian quantum groups, extending the rotational and the η-pairing su(2) symmetries we
encountered earlier. Following [172] we shall address the issue in a more general context. We present two pairs of fermionic representations of the Y(su(2)) Yangian quantum
group which commute with the trigonometric [162] and hyperbolic [40, 41] versions of
a Hubbard Hamiltonian with non-nearest-neighbour hopping. In both cases the two representations are also mutually commuting, hence can be combined into a representation
of Y(su(2))⊕Y(su(2)). The generators of the Yangian symmetry of the ordinary Hubbard
model (with nearest-neighbour hopping) and of a number of other interesting models like
the Haldane-Shastry spin-chain [194, 394] are obtained as special cases of our general
result.

14.1 Introduction
Quantum groups were introduced by Drinfeld [107, 109]. His original intention was to
put what we called the Yang-Baxter algebra into the mathematically more conventional
context of Hopf algebras. The Yangians are special quantum groups. Their representation
theory [80,81] is intimately related to the classiﬁcation of integrable quantum systems with
rational R-matrices.
Later [57] it became apparent that Yangians also play an interesting role as additional hidden symmetries of integrable systems, and moreover [58], that Yangians are
part of the symmetry algebra of such well studied integrable systems as the nearestneighbour Heisenberg model. These symmetries had been overlooked for a long time,
since for the models with nearest-neighbour interactions they are incompatible with periodic boundary conditions and for this reason do not combine with the familiar Bethe ansatz
methods.

We shall consider here a variant of the Hubbard model with more general hopping amplitudes:

where t jk = t j−k is a function of the difference of the site indices and

−i sh(κ)sh−1 (κn) for n = 0,
tn =
0
for n = 0.

(14.2)

The Hamiltonian (14.1) is hermitian if and only if the hopping matrix is, t jk = t¯k j . Setting
κ = a + ib in the deﬁnition (14.2) the requirement of hermiticity of the the Hamiltonian
is seen to be equivalent to a = 0 or b = mπ , m ∈ Z. Moreover, the case b = mπ is easily
recognized to be gauge equivalent to the case b = 0. We therefore restrict ourselves to purely
real or purely imaginary values of κ. More precisely, our choices for κ are κ = i π/N for a
ﬁnite lattice of N sites (‘trigonometric case’), and κ > 0 for an inﬁnite lattice (‘hyperbolic
case’). The energy scale has been chosen such as to give hopping amplitudes of absolute
value 1 between neighbouring sites. The summation indices run from 0 to N − 1 in the
trigonometric case, and over all integers in the hyperbolic case. The thermodynamic limit
of the trigonometric model and the limit κ → 0 of the hyperbolic model coincide. In both
cases t jk turns into −i/( j − k). The model is then called the 1/r -Hubbard model or, for
reasons that will become clear immediately, the chiral Hubbard model. In the limit κ → ∞,
the hyperbolic model turns, up to a local gauge transformation described below, into the
nearest-neighbour Hubbard model.
It may be interesting to notice, that the trigonometric and hyperbolic hopping amplitudes
can be interpreted as q-deformed 1/r -hopping. The notion of q-deformation is deﬁned by
rq = (q r − q −r )/(q − q −1 ). Setting q equal to eκ the hopping amplitudes become t jk =
−i/( j − k)q . The trigonometric case corresponds to q being the N -th root of unity, the
hyperbolic case to q > 1 (see ﬁgure 14.1).
In order to understand the physical meaning of the above kind of hopping amplitudes,
one has to consider the dispersion relation of the free model (u = 0) [40,158,162,172]. For
the trigonometric case we obtain
ε( p) =

where p = 2π(m + 1/2)/N , m = 0, . . . , N − 1. This yields ε( p) = π − p in the thermodynamic limit. The dispersion relation (14.3) is linear in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, the model
is chiral. It contains only left-moving particles. The physically most interesting point about
this chiral model is the appearance of a Mott transition at ﬁnite u > 0 [161, 162]. In the

The last expression is easily recognised as being, up to a redeﬁnition of scales, the logarithmic derivative of the Jacobi theta function ϑ4 (see [479]). As a function of κ it interpolates
between the sinusoidal dispersion relation of the of the nearest-neighbour model and the
saw-tooth-shaped dispersion relation of the 1/r model (see ﬁgure 14.2).
The local gauge transformation c j,a → eiϕ j c j,a , ϕ j real, does not alter the canonical anticommutation relations between the Fermi operators. The electron densities n j = n j,↑ + n j,↓
are invariant under this transformation, hence the interaction part of the Hamiltonian (14.1)
is invariant as well. This means that we can always use a local gauge transformation to modify the hopping term to our convenience. The modiﬁed model will be completely equivalent
to the original one. Consider the example ϕ j = jπ . This transformation introduces a factor
of (−1) j−k into the expression for the hopping amplitudes and shifts the dispersion relations by a half period. Using this transformation our conventions meet the conventions of
Gebhard and Ruckenstein [162]. To recover the nearest-neighbour Hubbard model in its
familiar form (2.31), it is not sufﬁcient to consider κ → ∞. In addition we have to apply a
gauge transformation with ϕ j = jπ/2. This transformation removes the factor of ‘i’ in front
of the hopping amplitude, changes the hopping amplitude to an even function, and shifts
the dispersion relation by a quarter period. Hence, the quadratic bottom of the sinusoidal
band is shifted to p = 0.

For our Hamiltonian (14.1) the role of the Shiba transformation (2.59) is taken by
†

c j↓ → c j↓ .

(14.5)

This transformation leaves every Hamiltonian of the form (14.1) with antisymmetric hopping matrix invariant. However, the operator of the total spin is mapped to a new independent
operator. Thus, the occurrence of two su(2) symmetries is generic for Hubbard models with
antisymmetric hopping amplitudes. The ordinary nearest-neighbour Hubbard model has
two su(2) symmetries, because it is gauge equivalent to the model with antisymmetric hopping amplitudes obtained as the limit κ → ∞ of the hyperbolic version of our Hamiltonian
(14.1). We shall see below that the additional generators of the Yangian symmetry as well
are doubled by the transformation (14.5).

14.3 Construction of the Yangian generators
We shall now present an ad hoc construction of the generators of the Yangian symmetry of
the Hamiltonian (14.1). The generators will be written as sums involving the local current
operators S 0jk , S αjk introduced in Chapter 2 (see (2.73)). The true usefulness of this formulation will become apparent to those readers who try to verify the commutation relations
between the generators of the Yangian (Yangian Serre relations). The calculation considerably simpliﬁes if one uses the algebra of the current operators instead of the elementary
commutation relations between the Fermi operators.

Equations (14.6) and (14.7) generate a long list of succeedingly less general relations by
systematically equating all possible combinations of site indices. Generating this list one
may ﬁnd convenient to introduce S 0j as a short-hand notation for the particle number operator
S 0j j .

Since the particle number N̂ = j S 0j is conserved, only the term (S 0j )2 is relevant in
the interaction part of the Hamiltonian. The other terms could be removed by a shift of
the chemical potential. Similar to the case of the nearest-neighbour model in Chapter 2
we retained them here to make obvious the invariance of H under the transformation
(14.5).
Let us forget temporarily our deﬁnition (14.2) and consider the Hamiltonian (14.8) with

Here h 0 is a free parameter which ﬁxes the scale for J α .
The only solutions to the equations (14.10) correspond to the cases of trigonometric and
hyperbolic hopping amplitudes (14.2) under consideration. In the trigonometric case we
ﬁnd
f jk = 0 ,

g jk = 12 ctg (π ( j − k)/N ) ,

h jk = i sin−1 (π ( j − k)/N ) ,

(14.11)

whereas the solutions in the hyperbolic case are
f jk =

2u sh(κ( j − k))

g jk = 12 cth(κ( j − k)) ,

h jk = i sh−1 (κ( j − k)) .

(14.12)

The parameter h 0 has to be real in order for J α to be self adjoint. Choosing h 0 =
− sin(π/N ) in the trigonometric case and h 0 = −sh(κ) in the hyperbolic case we get
back to our original deﬁnition (14.2) of the hopping amplitudes. It is an unexpected
fact that J α does not depend on u in the trigonometric case, where therefore (see Section 14.4) hopping part and interaction part of the Hamiltonian separately commute
with J α .
What is the nature of the operators J α ? They are of different kind than the conserved
operators generated by the logarithm of the transfer matrix of the Hubbard model. In fact it
turns out that the operators J α combined with the spin operators S α (see equation (2.66))
generate a representation of Drinfeld’s Y(su(2)) Yangian [107], i.e., the spin operators S α
and the conserved quantities J α satisfy the relations

have been used. Equations (14.13a) are nothing but the su(2) commutation relations between
the spin operators. Equations (14.13b) mean that the J α transform like a vector representation of su(2), and are easily conﬁrmed for our J α . (14.13c) is called the Yangian Serre
relation. Since both, (14.13b) and (14.13c), are homogeneous, we could have introduced
a deformation parameter, say h 2 = 0, on the right-hand side of the Yangian Serre relation
(14.13c). Because this parameter merely ﬁxes the scale of J α and has no deeper physical
meaning, we suppressed it here. Equations (14.13) have been conﬁrmed by direct calculation [172]. We have to warn the reader though, that the calculation is rather lengthy. Before
we comment on its details we formulate one more result.
Under the transformation (14.5) the generators S α , J β transform into an independent
set of generators S  α , J  β of another representation of the Y(su(2)) Yangian. The two
representations mutually commute, hence can be combined into a representation of the
direct sum Y(su(2))⊕Y(su(2)). Their mutual commutativity is non-trivial. It depends on
the speciﬁc form of the hopping amplitudes t jk and on the functional equations (14.10).
It thus may be claimed as being of ‘dynamical origin’. Of course, applying a local gauge
transformation with parameters ϕ j = jπ/2 to the operators −S  ± they turn into η± while
S  z turns into η z . Thus, one of the Yangian representations extends the spin representation
of su(2) while the other one extends the η-spin representation.
It seems rather hard to verify the validity of the Yangian Serre relation for our operators J α
in the original formulation formulation (14.13c). We may use the following simpliﬁcation
instead: let
K α = −iε αβγ [J β , J γ ] − 4δ(S β )2 S α .

(14.15)

Then a short but slightly tricky calculation (see appendices 14.A.5 and 14.A.7) shows that
(14.13c) can be replaced by the equation
[J α , K β ] + [J β , K α ] = 0 .

(14.16)

The left-hand side of (14.16) has a property that turns out to be very useful in practical
calculations. It is traceless. Assume we are given an operator J α , and we do already know
that it transforms as a vector representation of su(2). Then this knowledge assures the
identity [J α , K α ] = 0. It is therefore sufﬁcient to show that the left-hand side of equation
(14.16) is proportional to δ αβ . This is a severe simpliﬁcation, since the symmetrization
of the commutator produces numerous terms proportional to δ αβ , which can be neglected

(14.18c)

The homogeneity of the lattices has not been used in the veriﬁcation of the Yangian Serre
relation in the bulk. However, it is necessary to guarantee the commutativity of J α with
the Hamiltonian. This situation is similar to the case of the Yangian symmetric spin chains.
Therefore the existence of a Yangian symmetric long-range Hubbard Hamiltonian on an
inhomogeneous lattice was conjectured in [172]. In analogy to the spin chain case [199] the
generator of its Yangian symmetry might be constructed by adding ‘potential terms’ to the
second order Yangian generator K α , equation (14.15).
We would like to emphasize that Yangian symmetry does not imply integrability. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the models considered here are exactly solvable, and are special
cases of a more general exactly solvable non-Yangian-symmetric model with elliptic hopping amplitudes, which is known to have additional conserved operators of non-Yangian
type [210]. A proof of the ‘integrability’ of this model would provide the basis for an understanding of the Haldane-Shastry spin chain and the nearest-neighbour Hubbard model on a
common ground. At our present state of knowledge these models appear rather dissimilar.
The integrability of the Haldane-Shastry chain has been shown by exploiting a mapping
to a related dynamical model [446], whereas the integrability of the nearest-neighbour
Hubbard model is based on Shastry’s R-matrix (12.120). We expect that a proof of the
integrability of the non-nearest-neighbour Hubbard models would reveal a more generic
structure.

14.4 Special cases
Our representation (14.9) of the generators J α of the Y(su(2)) Yangian contains two free
parameters κ and u in the hyperbolic case. This offers the possibility to consider various
limiting cases. Another possibility comes from considering the restriction to the spin chain
space of states with every lattice site occupied by precisely one electron. As we shall
see below this restriction makes sense in the trigonometric as well as in hyperbolic the
case.

14.4 Special cases

571

We have shown above that the ordinary Hubbard Hamiltonian is a special case of the
Hamiltonian (14.1) with hyperbolic hopping amplitudes and is recovered in the limit κ → ∞
through a local gauge transformation c j,a → i j c j,a . Let us apply the same manipulations to
the ﬁrst-level generator J α of the representation of the Yangian. For κ → ∞ the solutions
(14.12) of the functional equations (14.10) have the limits f jk = δ| j−k|,1 /2u, g jk = sign( j −
k)/2, h jk = 0. We thus obtain

for α = x, y, z. These operators are the generators of the Yangian symmetry of the Hubbard
model on the inﬁnite lattice. The Yangian generators E 1 , F1 and H1 of Uglov and Korepin
[462] are linear combinations of these operators, E 1 = 2u(J x + iJ y ), F1 = 2u(J x − iJ y )
and H1 = 4u J z .
Keeping κ ﬁxed but sending u to inﬁnity we obtain another interesting limiting case.1

This formula also holds for the trigonometric case where f jk = 0. Clearly, S α and J0 , α, β =
x, y, z, generate a representation of Y(su(2)). But what is the corresponding Y(su(2))invariant Hamiltonian?
We note that
[S α , P0 ] = [J0α , P0 ] = 0 ,

(14.23)

.
where P0 = j (1 − n j↑ n j↓ ) is the familiar projection operator (see appendix 2.A and
Chapter 12.3.5) onto the space with no doubly occupied lattice site. The equations (14.23)
mean that S α and J0α leave the space with no doubly occupied lattice site invariant. They
are consequences of the local identities
[S αj , P0 ] = [(S 0j + Sk0 − 2)S αjk , P0 ] = 0

(14.24)

which follow from (14.6), (14.7). Let us consider the Hamiltonian H = T + 4u D, where

572

The Yangian symmetry of the Hubbard model

This Hamiltonian commutes with J α , since the Hamiltonian (14.1) does and since [J α , N̂ ] =
0. Hence,
[H, J α ] = [T, J0α ] + 4u[D, J0α ] + u1 [T, J1α ] + 4[D, J1α ] = 0

(14.26)

for all u ∈ R. We conclude that [D, J0α ] = 0, which proves our claim above that in the
trigonometric case hopping part and interaction part of the Hamiltonian separately commute
with J α . We further conclude that [T, J0α ] = 4[J1α , D] and thus, using (14.23) and P0 D =
D P0 = 0,
[P0 T P0 , J0α ] = P0 [T, J0α ]P0 = 4P0 [J1α , D]P0 = 0 .
This means that the t-0 Hamiltonian

with trigonometric [476] or hyperbolic hopping amplitudes (14.2) commutes with the Yangian generators J0α . Again by (14.23) it also commutes with the spin operators S α . Therefore
the trigonometric and hyperbolic t-0 models are Yangian invariant.
We have yet another option to further specialize the generators J0α . Equation (14.23)
means that S α and J0α leave the space with a ﬁxed number of doubly occupied sites invariant.
Moreover, [J0α , N̂ ] = [S α , N̂ ] = 0. It follows that the restrictions of J0α and S α to the ‘spin
chain space of states’, say H S , where every lattice site is occupied by exactly one electron,
form a representation of the Y(su(2)) Yangian. Now, since [(S 0j + Sk0 − 2), S αjk ] = 0 and
since S 0j + Sk0 − 2 annihilates H S , the restriction of J0α to H S is

For this expression to be zero both sums have to vanish independently. The vanishing of
the square bracket under the ﬁrst sum is easily seen to be equivalent to s jk = c|t jk |2 , where
t jk is the hopping amplitude (14.2) and c is an arbitrary constant. Inserting this result into
the second sum we see that it only vanishes when restricted to the spin chain space of
states, where we can replace Sk0 by 1 and S αj by 12 σ jα . On the spin chain space of states
the Hamiltonian HS reduces to the well studied (for a review see [195]) Haldane-Shastry

would be Yangian invariant. This is, however, not the case. Due to (14.31) only the restriction
of Ht−J to the spin chain space of states, which is equivalent to the Heisenberg Hamiltonian,
commutes with JSα . This nicely relates to the fact that for general J the t-J model is not
solvable by nested Bethe ansatz [377].

14.5 Conclusions
Following [172] we have constructed a pair of fermionic representations of the Y(su(2))
Yangian, one of them extending the spin representation of su(2) the other one the η-spin
representation. The two representations of the Yangian are simply related to one another by
the Shiba transformation (14.5). It is was therefore sufﬁcient to concentrate our discussion
on the spin representation of the Yangian deﬁned by the spin operators S α and the additional ‘ﬁrst level generators’ J α , equations (14.9), (14.11) and (14.12). These generators
commute with the Hamiltonian (14.1) which therefore can be called Yangian symmetric.
For the Hamiltonian as well as for the generators J α we have to distinguish between a
trigonometric case which applies to a ﬁnite chain with periodic boundary conditions and
a hyperbolic case which applies to an inﬁnite chain. The hyperbolic case has two free parameters, the Hubbard interaction u and the decay length of the hopping κ. Thus, we could
rather say we have obtained a two-parametric family of representations of the Y(su(2)) Yangian together with a two-parametric Yangian invariant Hamiltonian. This two-parametric
family has several interesting limiting cases which were discussed in Section 14.4. Most
important for us is the limit κ → ∞ which, in conjunction with a gauge transformation, led
us to the generators (14.19) of the spin representation of the Yangian of the usual Hubbard
model.

574

The Yangian symmetry of the Hubbard model

This representation commutes with the Hubbard Hamiltonian on the inﬁnite interval and
is not compatible with periodic boundary conditions. Hence, there is no natural action of the
ﬁrst level Yangian generators on the Bethe ansatz eigenstates of Chapter 3 and Chapter 12.
Yet, we shall see in Chapter 15 that the eigenstates of the Hubbard model one the inﬁnite
interval over the empty lattice vacuum can be constructed directly by a variant of the
quantum inverse scattering method. These eigenstates are then shown to transform like
tensor products of so-called evaluation representations of the Yangian.
In a number of appendices we shall present some background material about Yangians.
Our account will stay elementary. We will concentrate on the speciﬁc example of the
Y(su(2)) Yangian and will not say much about the general theory of quantum groups. We
included proofs of several theorems which are not easily accessible in the literature. It
is our hope that the appendix will provide a useful bridge for those readers who are familiar
with the quantum inverse scattering method and would like to start studying the mathematical literature on quantum groups.

In this appendix we elaborate further on the mathematical structure of the class of models
which have the same R-matrix R(λ) = P Ř(λ) as the su(d)-XXX spin chain (see (12.49),
(12.55)). For our convenience we write this R-matrix here as
R(λ) = λ + η P ,

(14.A.1)

i.e., we set η = ic and change the normalization as compared to (12.49). R(λ) is often called
the gl(d) invariant R-matrix.

14.A.2 Quantum symmetric functions and a theorem of Kulish and Sklyanin
Using (14.A.5) we can represent the sum over the principle minors of rank N of the determinant of a monodromy
matrix



⊗N
−
system as σ N(cl) (λ) = tr P1,...,N
T (cl) (λ)
. This function is easily seen to be the N th order symmetric polynomial in the eigenvalues of T (cl) (λ) which is known to be a generating
function of involutive integrals of motion (see [277] and references therein). One may ask,
what is the quantum analogue of σ N(cl) (λ)? The answer is not known in the general case. For
models with the R-matrix (14.A.1), however, Kulish and Sklyanin were able to construct
such quantum analogue [277]. Their construction is based on equation (14.A.5) and will be
presented below.
For any monodromy matrix T (λ) representing the Yang-Baxter algebra with rational
R-matrix (14.A.1) and for any N = 1, . . . , d we deﬁne the ‘quantum symmetric function’
 −

σ N (λ) = tr P1,...,N
T1 (λ)T2 (λ + η) . . . TN (λ + (N − 1)η) .
(14.A.12)
Note that the classical limit (η → 0) of σ N (λ) is σ N(cl) (λ) and that σ1 (λ) is the transfer matrix
of the system.

Theorem 1. (Kulish and Sklyanin [277]). The quantum symmetric functions σ N (λ) form a
commutative family:
[σ N (λ), σ M (µ)] = 0 ,

(14.A.13)

for all N , M = 1, . . . , d and for all λ, µ ∈ C.
The higher quantum symmetric functions may generate additional conserved quantities
which, because of the theorem, commute with the conserved quantities generated by the
transfer matrix t(λ) = σ1 (λ).
The remaining part of this subsection is devoted to the proof of the theorem. Since the
proof is rather lengthy, we divided it into several lemmata.

Proof. We will prove equation (14.A.14a) by induction over N . The argument is based on
the resolved recursion formula (14.A.8a) and on the elementary fact that
R jk (−N η) = −η(N − P jk ) .

Using the latter equation for N = 1 we ﬁnd

and (14.A.14a) is proven for N = 2.

and the proof of (14.A.14a) is complete. We used (14.A.17) and the induction hypothesis
in the ﬁrst equation, the Yang-Baxter algebra in the second equation, and again (14.A.17)
in the third equation. The proof of the remaining equations is very similar. For the proof of
(14.A.14b) and (14.A.14d) one has to take into account that R12 (λ) = R21 (λ).

14.A.3 The quantum determinant
In this section we work out the properties of the ‘highest’ quantum symmetric function
σd (λ). We have already seen that this function turns into the determinant of the classical
monodromy matrix in the classical limit η → 0. We shall see below that even for non-zero
η the function σd (λ) has all the characteristic properties of the usual determinant. For this
reason we call
detq (T (λ)) = σd (λ − (d − 1)η)

(14.A.39)

the quantum determinant of the monodromy matrix T (λ). The shift in the spectral parameter
by (d − 1)η has been introduced for later notational convenience.
The quantum determinant was ﬁrst introduced in [213], where it was used to invert the
monodromy matrix. Its most remarkable property is its commutativity with all the elements
of the monodromy matrix. In other words, the quantum determinant is in the centre of the
Yang-Baxter algebra. The reason why we discuss the quantum determinant here is that it
also generates the centre of the Yangian quantum group Y(gl(n)) which (for n = 2) will be
introduced in the following section.
Let us mention two alternative expressions for the quantum determinant of T (λ). Using
the totally antisymmetric tensor

to consider the important example of the fundamental representation of the Yang-Baxter
algebra generated by (14.A.1). Recall that the corresponding fundamental L-matrix (see
αγ
Section 12.1) has matrix elements L αβ (λ) = Rβδ (λ)eγδ .

where detq (L(λ)) is the quantum determinant of the fundamental L-matrix associated with
the R-matrix (14.A.1). According to lemma 6 this quantum determinant is proportional to
the unit matrix Id , which completes the proof of (iv).

In the next section, where we introduce the Yangians Y(gl(2)) and Y(sl(2)), we shall

Let us illustrate some of our results again with our chief example, the inhomogeneous
spin- 12 -XXX chain (see Sections 12.1.6 and 12.1.7). The quantum determinant of the elementary L-matrix, (12.52) with α, β = 1, 2, follows from lemma 6 by a change in notation
and normalization,
detq (L j (λ, ν j )) =

λ − ν j − ic

λ − νj

(14.A.65)

Here we suppressed the identity operator in quantum space on the right-hand side of the equation. The quantum determinant of the monodromy matrix T (λ) = L L (λ, ν L ) . . . L 1 (λ, ν1 )
then follows by multiplicativity, equation (14.A.50),

Thus, for the fundamental representation the quantum determinant is just a number (multiplied by the identity operator) and generates no additional conserved quantities. We wish

588

to emphasize, however, that the situation may be different for general non-fundamental
representations, where the quantum determinant may be a non-trivial operator.
It follows from (14.A.66) and (14.A.51) that the monodromy matrix T (λ) of the inhomogeneous spin- 12 -XXX chain is invertible for λ = ν j , ν j + ic, j = 1, . . . , L, and that

14.A.4 The Yangians Y(gl(2)) and Y(sl(2))
Yangians associated with any simple Lie algebra a were introduced by Drinfeld in his
seminal article [107] which marked the advent of quantum groups. Of the different possible
characterizations of the Yangians [107, 108, 247] (see also Chapter12 of [82]) in terms of
generators we shall choose the least general one [247] as a starting point of our account.
It has the advantage of being closely related to concepts we are already familiar with,
the Yang-Baxter algebra and the quantum determinant. This is the favoured approach to
Yangians in the physics literature (e.g. [58,195,337]). For simple Lie algebras it is restricted
to a = sl(n), but an extention to a = gl(n) is possible. We shall be rather modest and consider
only the Yangians associated with sl(2) and gl(2) which will be enough for our purposes.
Our presentation in this section closely follows the appendix of [337].
The Yangian Y(gl(2)) is the associative algebra (with unit e) generated by the entries of
the matrix coefﬁcients Tn in the formal asymptotic series

of the Yang-Baxter algebra with rational R-matrix Ř(λ) = η + λP.
Inserting (14.A.68) into (14.A.69) and comparing order by order in λ and µ we obtain
two inﬁnite sets of relations for the Tm :
T1 ⊗ Tn − P(Tn ⊗ T1 )P = P(Tn ⊗ I2 − I2 ⊗ Tn ) ,

(σ ⊗ I2 )P = 12 (σ α ⊗ I2 + I2 ⊗ σ α − iεαβγ σ β ⊗ σ γ ) ,

(14.A.72b)
(14.A.72c)
(14.A.72d)
(14.A.72e)

To obtain an example of how this works take, for instance, the trace of equation (14.A.70a).
Then, because of the invariance of the trace under cyclic exchange of matrices with com0
muting entries, the left-hand side of the equation turns into [J00 , Jn−1
]. The right-hand side
can be calculated by means of (14.A.72a). It vanishes since tr(I2 ) = 2 and tr(σ α ) = 0.
Proceeding in this spirit we arrive after a little algebra at the following set of equations,
[J0α , Jn0 ] = 0 ,

(14.A.73a)

[J0α , Jnβ ] = iε αβγ Jnγ ,

(14.A.73g)

These equations are equivalent to (14.A.70). They provide a characterization of the Yangian
Y(gl(2)) in terms of the generators Jn0 and Jnα .
It turns out that the generators are not all independent. (14.A.73g) can be used to derive
β
a recursion relation expressing Jnα in terms of Jm0 , Jm , m ≤ n − 1. For this purpose we ﬁrst
set m = 0 and replace n by n − 1 in (14.A.73g). Then we use (14.A.73b) on the left-hand
side and multiply by εδαβ . The resulting equation is equivalent to the recursion relation

for n ∈ N. Using J00 = a20 and equations (14.A.74) and (14.A.79) we can recursively express
Jn0 and Jnα in terms of J0α , J1α and the an . In other words, the Yangian Y(gl(2)) is generated
by J0α , J1α , α = x, y, z, and by the coefﬁcients of the asymptotic expansion of the quantum
determinant which belong to its centre. Setting all the an equal to zero we obtain the
Yangian Y(sl(2)). Thus, the Yangian Y(sl(2)) is the associative algebra generated by entries
of the matrices Tn in (14.A.68) modulo the relations (14.A.69) and the further constraint
that detq (T (λ)) = 1. The Yangian Y(sl(2)) has only six independent generators, J0α , J1α ,
α = x, y, z.
14.A.5 The deformed Serre relation for Y(sl(2)) and Y(gl(2))
We have seen in the preceding section that the Yangian Y(sl(2)) has only a ﬁnite number
β
of independent ‘elementary’ generators: given J0α and J1 , the inﬁnitely many remaining
generators occurring in (14.A.73) are determined by the recursion relations (14.A.74) and
(14.A.79). This raises the interesting question of whether we can deﬁne the Yangian entirely

which are contained

β
only J0α and J1 . It is clear on the other hand, that these two relations do not completely
determine the structure of the Yangian, for they merely indicate that the J0α generate sl(2)
β
as a subalgebra of Y(sl(2)) and that the J1 transform like a vector representation of sl(2).
Starting from (14.A.73) we shall derive an independent higher-order relation between
β
the elementary Yangian generators J0α , J1 which is called the Yangian Serre relation. The
Yangian Serre relation was introduced by Drinfeld [107]. Drinfeld could show that the Yangian Serre relation together with the two equations (14.A.80) uniquely determines Y(sl(2))
as a Hopf algebra (for the Hopf algebra structure of Y(sl(2)) see the next Section 14.A.6).
For our derivation of the Serre relations from (14.A.73) we shall need the explicit exβ
pressions for J2 , J00 and J10 as obtainable from (14.A.79) and (14.A.74),

Here we introduced the notation (14.14) for the fully symmetrized triple product {·, ·, ·} and
the ‘structure constants’ aλµναβγ and cλµν in the last line.
Equation (14.A.89) is the Yangian Serre relation as introduced by Drinfeld [107].
(14.A.80) and (14.A.89) are compatible with a Hopf algebra structure (co-product, co-unit
and antipode) which will be derived the following section.
To round off this section let us introduce another, basis independent form of the Yangian
Serre relation which is frequently encountered in the literature (see e.g. [80–82]). For this
purpose we introduce the notation
J0 (x) = 12 tr(x T1 ) = xα J0α ,

(14.A.90a)

J1 (x) = 12 tr(x T2 ) = xα J1α ,

Similarly, the sl(2) relations (14.A.80) can be rewritten as
[J0 (x), J0 (y)] = J0 ([x, y]) ,

(14.A.93a)

[J0 (x), J1 (y)] = J1 ([x, y]) .

(14.A.93b)

By virtue of (14.A.93a) J0 (x) generates sl(2) as a Lie subalgebra of the Yangian. Since
the map x → J0 (x) is bijective, one may therefore identify x with J0 (x) as, for instance,
in [80–82].
Remark. The Yangian Serre relation (14.A.89) holds for Y(sl(2)) and also for Y(gl(2))
as should be clear from our derivation. However, while the algebra Y(sl(2)) is uniquely
deﬁned by the sl(2) relations (14.A.80) and the Yangian Serre relation (14.A.89), these
relations deﬁne Y(gl(2)) only modulo its non-trivial centre, generated by the quantum
determinant. Saying that Y(sl(2)) is uniquely deﬁned by (14.A.80) and (14.A.89) means
to say that the whole set of relations (14.A.73) follows from (14.A.80), (14.A.89) and the
recursion relations (14.A.74) and (14.A.79). We are not aware of a direct proof of this fact
in the literature. Clearly a proof should proceed by induction over n, but due to the rather
complicated form of (14.A.79) this proof may be involved. Instead Drinfeld [107] used the
‘natural’ Hopf algebra structure of Y(sl(2)) to be discussed in the following section in order
to show its uniqueness as a ‘quantized Lie bialgebra’.

14.A.6 The Hopf algebra structure of Y(sl(2))
Up to this point we have regarded the Yangian Y(sl(2)) as an associative algebra, i.e., as
a vector space endowed with an associative multiplication. We shall see below that much
more structure is implicitly contained in our deﬁnition.
We observed in Section 12.1.5 that tensor products of representations of the Yang-Baxter
algebra (e.g. products of elementary L-matrices) are again representations. This is one of
the essential properties of the Yang-Baxter algebra. It allowed us to construct integrable,

594

Appendices to Chapter 14

interacting L-site spin chains from elementary L-matrices describing a single site. In anticipation of a deﬁnition below, which is obtained by promoting this property from the level
of representations to the level of algebras, we called it the co-multiplication property.
The elements of a monodromy matrix obtained by ‘co-multiplication of elementary Lmatrices’ are

(14.A.94)

where the tensor products on the right hand side are tensor products in quantum space. In
former sections we were hiding these tensor products in our notation, either by using
subindices, or the notation L(λ| j) (see e.g. theorem 2) in order to indicate on which
quantum space the L-matrix was acting non-trivially. In the following we shall partially
adjust our notation to the conventions used in mathematics. We will write (multiple) tensor
products of Y(sl(2)) explicitly and use indices for the description of the matrix structure in
auxiliary space. Then (14.A.69), for instance, turns into
j

jm

Ř iljm (λ − µ) Tk (λ)Tnm (µ) = T ji (µ)Tml (λ) Řkn (λ − µ) .

(14.A.95)

For brevity let us now write A = Y(sl(2)). We deﬁne a homomorphism of vector spaces
(linear map)  : A → A ⊗ A by


j
(T (λ))ik =  T (λ)ik = T ji (λ) ⊗ Tk (λ) .

(14.A.96)

Using (14.A.95) we ﬁnd that

 jm
Ř iljm (λ − µ)  Tk (λ)  Tnm (µ) =  T ji (µ)  Tml (λ) Řkn (λ − µ) .

(14.A.97)

Furthermore, the multiplication property (14.A.50) of the quantum determinant implies

2
detq ((T (λ))) = detq (T (λ)) = 1 .

(14.A.98)

Now (14.A.97) and (14.A.98) are precisely the equations that deﬁne the algebra structure of
A = Y(sl(2)). This means that  is a homomorphism of algebras. In other words  induces
the algebra structure of A onto the tensor product A ⊗ A.  is called the co-multiplication
or co-product.

It is not difﬁcult to compute the images of the elementary generators J0α and J1 under
the action of . On the one hand we have

where we used the fact that J00 = a0 /2 = 0 and (14.A.72c) in (14.A.102b). Equation
β
(14.A.97) implies, of course, that (J0α ) and (J1 ) satisfy the sl(2) relations (14.A.80)
and the Yangian Serre relation (14.A.89).
Next, we deﬁne a linear map ε : A → C, setting


ε Tki (λ) = δki .
(14.A.103)
ε is called the co-unit.
With the aid of the co-unit we obtain (in a sense) the inverse of , for we have




j
(ε ⊗ id) Tki (λ) = ε T ji (λ) ⊗ Tk (λ) = 1 ⊗ Tki (λ) = Tki (λ) ,


j
(id ⊗ ε) Tk (λ) = T ji (λ) ⊗ ε Tk (λ) = Tki (λ) ⊗ 1 = Tki (λ) .
(14.A.104b)
In the last equations we identiﬁed as usual A with C ⊗ A or A ⊗ C.
β
The images of the elementary generators J0α and J1 under the action of the co-unit are
again easily obtained. Because of the linearity of ε we have ε(δki e) = δki and ε(Tn ik ) = 0 for
all n ∈ N. Thus,
ε(J0α ) = ε(J1α ) = 0 .

(14.A.105)

With this trivial action on the generators ε is an algebra homomorphism A → C which
generates the so-called trivial representation in C.
A vector space equipped with a co-unit ε and a co-multiplication  which satisfy the
‘compatibility conditions’ (14.A.104) is called a coalgebra. Thus, we have seen that the
Yangian Y(sl(2)) has a natural coalgebra structure. It is an algebra and a coalgebra at the same
time. Clearly the co-multiplication  deﬁned in (14.A.96) is coassociative: ( ⊗ id) =
(id ⊗ ).
Algebras and coalgebras are described as ‘dual notions’ in the mathematical literature
(see e.g. [82]): the multiplication in an algebra naturally deﬁnes a linear map µ : A ⊗
A → A if one sets µ(a ⊗ b) = ab for any two elements a, b ∈ A. Mathematicians call this

596

Appendices to Chapter 14

map ‘the multiplication’. They further introduce a linear map ι : C → A which formalizes
the identiﬁcation of a number λ ∈ C with the element λe ∈ A, ι(λ) = λe. Then ι and µ
satisfy relations similar (or dual) to the relations between ε and . The associativity of the
multiplication is, for instance, expressed as µ(µ ⊗ id) = µ(id ⊗ µ). The idea of duality
becomes more transparent when expressed in the language of commutative diagrams. For
this issue the reader is referred to [82].
We are now prepared for the abstract deﬁnition of a Hopf algebra.
Deﬁnition. Hopf algebra.
(i) A Hopf algebra A (over C) is both an associative algebra and a coassociative coalgebra.
(ii) The co-multiplication  and the co-unit ε are homomorphisms of algebras.
(iii) A is equipped with a bijective map S : A → A, called the antipode, such that
µ(S ⊗ id) = µ(id ⊗ S) = ι ◦ ε .

(14.A.106)

We have seen so far that the Yangian Y(sl(2)) with co-unit (14.A.103) and comultiplication (14.A.96) satisﬁes (i) and(ii). Can we ﬁnd an antipode such that also
(14.A.106) holds? To answer this question let us act with (14.A.106) on Tki (λ). We obtain

 j
 j 
S T ji (λ) Tk (λ) = T ji (λ)S Tk (λ) = δki e .
(14.A.107)
From the latter equation we conclude that we must necessarily have S(T (λ)) = T −1 (λ).
But, since detq (T (λ)) = 1, this inverse exists for the Yangian, and we obtain by (14.A.51)


S Tki (λ) = (T −1 )ik (λ) = (σ y T t (λ − η)σ y )ik .
(14.A.108)
We have thus shown that the Yangian Y(sl(2)) has the structure of a Hopf algebra.

As an exercise for the reader we propose to verify (14.A.106) for the elementary generators
β
J0α and J1 .
Setting S(T (λ)T (µ)) = (T (λ)T (µ))−1 = T −1 (λ)T −1 (µ) we see that the antipode naturally extends to an antiautomorphism of A, i.e., S(ab) = S(b)S(a) for any two
elements a, b ∈ A. This is a property of the antipode which holds in any Hopf
algebra [1].
Let us summarize: we have shown by identifying the structure maps , ε, µ, ι and S
that the Yangian Y(sl(2)) has a natural Hopf algebra structure, and we have computed the
β
images of the elementary generators J0α and J1 under , ε and S.
Although it would provide a deeper insight into the algebraic structure of integrable systems we avoided Drinfeld’s original way [107, 109] of introducing Yangians as ‘quantizations of Lie bialgebras’ (see also [82]). Drinfeld’s original reasoning requires a background
in algebra which is beyond the needs and the level of abstraction of this book. The intention
of this appendix is to provide a bridge from the quantum inverse scattering method to the
theory of quantum groups (the Yangians are special quantum groups), such that the interested reader is able to start studying the mathematical literature (e.g. the books [82, 310])
on his or her own.
Recall that we began our considerations with the Yang-Baxter algebra relations (14.A.69)
imposed on the formal asymptotic series (14.A.68). We have shown that the algebra
generated by the coefﬁcients of the formal asymptotic series has a ﬁnite number of elβ
ementary generators J0α and J1 , α, β = 1, 2, 3, if we impose the additional constraint
detq (T (λ)) = 1. Then we have derived a set of relations (14.A.80) and (14.A.89) satisﬁed
by the elementary generators and have ﬁnally worked out the Hopf algebra structure of the
algebra.
Drinfeld reverses this reasoning. He deﬁnes the Yangian Y(a) of an arbitrary simple
Lie algebra a by prescribing the action of the Hopf algebra structure maps on a ﬁnite
number of generators (J0 (I α ), J1 (I α ) with {I α } an orthonormal basis of a) and imposing
appropriate ‘constraints’ (the deformed Serre relations) on these generators in such a way
that the co-multiplication becomes a homomorphism of algebras. For a = sl(2) this means,
in particular, that the Hopf algebra structure is deﬁned by (14.A.102), (14.A.105) and
(14.A.111) and the algebra structure by the sl(2) relations (14.A.80) and the Yangian Serre
relation (14.A.89). In Drinfeld’s approach the choice of the co-multiplication is primary.
His choice is motivated by the ‘quantization problem’ for Lie bialgebras [107,276] which is
related to the problem of assigning a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation to every solution
of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. A theorem of Drinfeld (theorem 1 of [107]) states
that the Yangian Y(a) is unique as a quantization of the Lie bialgebra associated with a (for
details see [82, 107, 109]).
The representation theory of the Yangian Y(sl(2)) has been worked out by Chari and
Pressley. Their paper [80] is written on a moderate level of abstraction and should be rather
easily accessible. The representation theory makes essential use of an alternative realization
of the Yangians, again introduced by Drinfeld [108].

Appendices to Chapter 14

14.A.7 Some details of the veriﬁcation of the Yangian Serre relation for the Hubbard
model with variable range hopping
In this last section of the appendix we would like to relate the appendix with the main body
of the chapter and add a few technical comments.
First of all we have to adjust the notation. Equation (14.13) follows from (14.A.80)
and (14.A.89) by setting δ = −η2 /4, S α = J0α and J α = J1α . Moreover K α = 2J2α , and
(14.15) follows from (14.A.81) and (14.A.82) in the Y(sl(2)) case a0 = a1 = 0. Our claim
in the main text that we obtain an equivalent set of equations by replacing the Yangian
Serre relation in (14.13) with (14.16) is easily proven by reversing the order of steps in the
calculation in appendix 14.A.5 that led from (14.A.83) to (14.A.89).
Finally we wish to justify our statement that equations (14.13a) and (14.13b) imply
α
[J , K α ] = 0. We prove the slightly stronger statement that (14.A.80)–(14.A.82) lead

shown by exploiting (14.A.80)) in the fourth equation. The large curly brackets indicate
that we have three equivalent expressions in the third equation.

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite
interval limit

In this chapter we carry out the thermodynamic limit on the level of the monodromy matrix
introduced in Chapter 12. This means to change the strategy as compared to the Bethe ansatz
solutions put forward in Chapters 3 and 12 which depended crucially on the use of periodic
boundary conditions. The discreteness of the quasi momenta k j in the Bethe ansatz wave
function was due to the ﬁnite length L of the system. For inﬁnite L there will be no Lieb-Wu
equations which were our main tool for studying the Hubbard model in this book. Instead
the commutation relations for the elements of the inﬁnite interval monodromy matrix will
utilized in the calculations shown below.
We basically follow the articles [335,336], where the quantum inverse scattering method,
in the way as originally designed in [131, 404, 454], was applied to the Hubbard model.
Our account will be restricted to the case of zero electron density. Quite generally, the
quantum inverse scattering method, as originally conceived in the spirit of the ‘inverse
scattering theory’ for classical non-linear evolution equations, is restricted to uncorrelated
vacua (ground states) which limits the applicability of the method. Nevertheless, applying
it to the empty band ground state of the Hubbard model we shall obtain valuable additional
insights into its structure. We shall reveal the connection between Shastry’s R-matrix and
the Yangian symmetry discussed in Chapter 14. We shall construct creation and annihilation
operators of elementary excitations. These form a representation of the ZamolodchikovFaddeev algebra which means that their commutation relations provide the full bare Smatrix. We shall further see that the scattering states of elementary excitations transform as
tensor products of evaluation representations under the Yangian.

15.1 Preliminaries
Before proceeding to the description of the inﬁnite interval limit we have to adapt some
of our conventions to this purpose. First of all the Hubbard Hamiltonian for the inﬁnite

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

where we subtracted 1 in the local interaction part in order to have H |0 = 0. We also
slightly modify the L-matrix, setting
L̂ j (λ) = in j↑ +n j↓ L j (λ, 0)

(15.2)

for j ∈ Z, where L j (λ, 0) on the right hand side of this equation is the L-matrix introduced
in (12.227). The slight modiﬁcation of the L-matrix induces a modiﬁcation of the R-matrix
which must be replaced with
Ř(λ, µ) = V Ř(λ, µ)V −1 ,

V = diag(1, i, i, −1) ⊗ I4 ,

(15.3)

where Ř(λ, µ) is our original R-matrix (12.135). Then L̂ j (λ) is a representation of the graded
Yang-Baxter algebra with R-matrix (15.3) and grading p(1) = p(4) = 0, p(2) = p(3) = 1,
 


(15.4)
Ř(λ, µ) L̂ j (λ) ⊗s L̂ j (µ) = L̂ j (µ) ⊗s L̂ j (λ) Ř(λ, µ) .
In preparation of the thermodynamic limit we introduce a monodromy matrix T̂mn (λ) as
T̂mn (λ) = L̂m−1 (λ)L̂m−2 (λ) . . . L̂n (λ) ,

m, n ∈ Z, m > n .

(15.5)

It follows that T̂mn (λ) is another representation of the graded Yang-Baxter algebra (15.4).

15.2 Passage to the inﬁnite interval
We shall see in what follows that the thermodynamic limit leads to drastic simpliﬁcations
of the commutation relations between the elements of the monodromy matrix encoded
in the structure of a simpliﬁed R-matrix derived from (15.3). The commutation relations
will become simple enough to allow us to identify creation and annihilation operators of
elementary excitations, generators of conserved quantities and symmetry operators.
In taking the thermodynamic limit one cannot proceed naively. Some contributions to the
monodromy matrix which oscillate at large distances have to be treated appropriately, in
close analogy with the classical case [134]. These oscillating contributions depend on the
chosen vacuum which is characterized by the density of electrons ρ N and by the magnetization density ρ M . As a result of the thermodynamic limit we will obtain the ﬁnite energy
excitations over this vacuum. In contrast to the case of the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the ﬁnite periodic system we will not be able any more to distinguish between a pseudo-vacuum,
upon which all eigenstates of the transfer matrix are built by the action of creation operators,
and the physical vacuum, which is the true ground state of the model. In general, both states
will be characterized by different values of ρ M , ρ N and thus will be separated by an inﬁnite
energy difference in the thermodynamic limit.
The oscillating contributions to the monodromy matrix will be removed by splitting off
the asymptotics of its vacuum expectation value for m, −n → ∞, which therefore has to be
known a priori. For this reason the method [131, 404, 454] is restricted to (asymptotically)
uncorrelated vacua. In the case of the Hubbard model there are four possible choices:
the empty band (ρ M = ρ N = 0), the completely ﬁlled band (ρ M = 0, ρ N = 2), and the

15.2 Passage to the inﬁnite interval

601

half-ﬁlled band with all spins up (ρ M = 1, ρ N = 1) or all spins down (ρ M = −1, ρ N = 1).
In the following we will restrict ourselves to the empty-band vacuum |0 which is deﬁned by
cm,a |0 = 0 ,

m ∈ Z, a =↑, ↓ .

(15.6)

Let us now describe the general method in which we closely follow [404]. We deﬁne the
Hilbert space H of states of ‘compact support’ as the space of all ﬁnite linear combinations of
†
†
vectors cm 1 ,a1 . . . cm N ,a N |0 . The vacuum expectation value of the L-matrix will be denoted
by
V (λ) = 0|L̂m (λ)|0 .

(15.7)

V (λ) is independent of m, since the vacuum is translationally invariant. Let us introduce
L̃ j (λ) = V (λ)− j−1 L̂ j (λ)V (λ) j ,

(15.8)

T̃mn (λ) = V (λ)−m T̂mn (λ)V (λ)n .

(15.9)

It is easy to see that the limits limn→−∞ x|T̃mn (λ)|y and limm→∞ x|T̃mn (λ)|y exist for all
|x , |y ∈ H. These weak limits determine a pair of operators
T̃m+ (λ) = lim T̃nm (λ) ,

(15.10a)

T̃m− (λ) = lim T̃mn (λ)

lim T̃m+ (λ) = lim T̃m− (λ) = I4 .

Multiplying (15.5) from the left by L̂m (λ) or from the right by L̂n−1 (λ), we obtain two
recursion relations for T̂mn (λ), which induce a pair of recursion relations for T̃m+ (λ) and
T̃m− (λ). By use of the asymptotic condition (15.11) these are equivalent to the following
pair of Volterra type ‘integral equations’ for T̃m± (λ),

The above considerations imply the existence of the weak limit

T̃ (λ) is the ‘regularized’ monodromy matrix. As can be inferred from equation (15.12), or
(15.13) respectively, T̃ (λ) has the ‘integral representation’

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

Note that 0|(L̃m (λ) − I4 )|0 = 0 by construction. Hence, 0|T̃ (λ)|0 = I4 . Equation
(15.15) can be taken as the deﬁnition of the monodromy matrix on the inﬁnite line. Later
we will use it in order to obtain the generators of the Yangian and to calculate the action of
products of operator entries of T̃ (λ) on the vacuum |0 .
All we have to do to set equation (15.15) at work for a concrete model is to calculate
L̃m (λ). This is easily done for the Hubbard model. Using (12.285) and (15.2) we ﬁnd
V (λ) = diag(e2h , − tg (λ), − tg (λ), tg 2 (λ)e2h ) ,

(15.16)

and we conclude that

Here we have used the functions k(λ) and p(λ) introduced in (12.331), (12.332).
Next we will turn to the calculation of the commutation relations between the elements
of T̃ (λ). Let
L(2)
m (λ, µ) = Lm (λ) ⊗s Lm (µ) ,

(15.18)

(2)
Tmn
(λ, µ) = Tmn (λ) ⊗s Tmn (µ) .

(15.19)

We may apply the same regularization scheme we applied to Tmn (λ) also to the matrix
(2)
Tmn
(λ, µ). We simply have to replace V (λ) by
V (2) (λ, µ) = 0|L(2)
m (λ, µ)|0 .

(15.20)

Note that V (2) (λ, µ) is not just the tensor product V (λ) ⊗s V (µ). There appear additional
off-diagonal terms due to normal ordering of the operators. Following the same steps as in
our discussion above we obtain a regularized tensor-product matrix
T̃ (2) (λ, µ) =

On the other hand, taking the vacuum expectation value of the local exchange relation
(15.4) yields
R(λ, µ)V (2) (λ, µ) = V (2) (µ, λ)R(λ, µ) ,

(15.22)

R(λ, µ)T̃ (2) (λ, µ) = T̃ (2) (µ, λ)R(λ, µ) .

(15.23)

and we conclude that

(2)
If T̃mn
(λ, µ) is deﬁned in analogy with T̃mn (λ), with V (2) (λ, µ) replacing V (λ) in (15.9),
then
(2)
T̃mn (λ) ⊗s T̃mn (µ) = Um (λ, µ)−1 T̃mn
(λ, µ)Un (λ, µ) ,

(15.24)

where we have introduced the matrix


Un (λ, µ) = V (2) (λ, µ)−n V (λ)n ⊗s V (µ)n .

(15.25)

Let us tentatively assume that the limits
U+ (λ, µ)−1 = lim Um (λ, µ)−1 , U− (λ, µ) = lim Um (λ, µ)
m→∞

m→−∞

(15.26)

exist in some appropriate sense. Then, according to equation (15.24) T̃mn (λ) ⊗s T̃mn (µ) has
a weak limit for m, −n → ∞. This limit may be identiﬁed with T̃ (λ) ⊗s T̃ (µ),
T̃ (λ) ⊗s T̃ (µ) = U+ (λ, µ)−1 T̃ (2) (λ, µ)U− (λ, µ) .

(15.27)

Inserting the above equation into (15.23), we arrive at the exchange relation for the monodromy matrix T̃ (λ) on the inﬁnite interval,

 

R̃(+) (λ, µ) T̃ (λ) ⊗s T̃ (µ) = T̃ (µ) ⊗s T̃ (λ) R̃(−) (λ, µ) ,
(15.28)
where
R̃(±) (λ, µ) = U± (µ, λ)−1 R(λ, µ)U± (λ, µ) .

(15.29)

The calculation of the matrices U± (λ, µ) is cumbersome but straightforward. Some of
the technical steps involved are discussed in the appendix of [336]. Here we only note
that there is no common domain of convergence for all matrix elements of U+ (λ, µ) and
U− (λ, µ). Therefore equation (15.28) has to be interpreted as a set of equations for the
matrix elements with different domains of validity. The behaviour of the matrix elements
at the boundaries of these domains is singular (see appendix of [336]) and it is only at these
boundaries where the matrix elements of U+ (λ, µ) and U− (λ, µ) may be distinct. In the
αβ
αβ
following we stay away from these singular points. Then U+ γ δ (λ, µ) = U− γ δ (λ, µ) and
there is no difference between R̃(+) (λ, µ) and R̃(−) (λ, µ).
It is a nontrivial matter of fact that all the matrix elements of U± (λ, µ) calculated from
(15.25) and (15.26) turn out to be rational functions of the original Boltzmann weights
ρ j (λ, µ). Therefore the matrix elements of the new R-matrix R̃(λ, µ) = R̃(+) (λ, µ) =
R̃(−) (λ, µ) equally depend rationally on the Boltzmann weights. Numerous cancellations of

604

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

terms occur such that the new R-matrix has only 18 non-vanishing elements as compared
to the 36 non-vanishing elements of the original R-matrix. As in our treatment of the
algebraic Bethe ansatz in Chapter 12 the structure of the commutation relations between
the monodromy matrix elements encoded in (15.28) comes out more clearly when written
in block form: we deﬁne 2 × 2 matrices A(λ), B(λ), C(λ), D(λ) by assuming that T̃ (λ) is
of the form (12.272). Then applying the similarity transformation X deﬁned in (12.279) to
(15.28) we end up with

All information about the Hubbard model on the inﬁnite line at zero density is contained
in equations (15.30), (15.31) and (15.15). These equations will be studied in the following
sections in order to determine and to classify the spectrum of elementary excitations of the
Hubbard model. We wish to emphasize that the commutation relations encoded in (15.30)
and (15.31) are much simpler as compared to the relations (12.280) which were the starting
point for the algebraic Bethe ansatz calculation of Chapter 12. In fact, if it were not for
3 ρ4
the two diagonal elements 1−ρ
of ř (λ, µ) all commutation relations would reduce to the
ρ4 ρ8
mere interchange of two factors along with the multiplication of some rational function of
the Boltzmann weights.

15.3 Yangian symmetry and commuting operators
It is clear from the form of (15.30) that the 2 × 2 matrices A(λ), . . . , D(λ) generate subalgebras of (15.28). The understanding of the structure of these subalgebras will be the
key for the interpretation of our results. Our ﬁrst task will be to ﬁnd again the Hubbard
Hamiltonian which got lost during our passage to the inﬁnite line. Before, in Chapter 12,
we obtained it by expanding the logarithm of str(T (λ)) in the vicinity of λ = 0. But this
cannot work anymore, because the inﬁnite line monodromy matrix T̃ (λ) is not analytic at
λ = 0. Amazingly, the study of the subalgebra generated by A(λ),

 

ř (λ, µ) A(λ) ⊗ A(µ) = A(µ) ⊗ A(λ) ř (λ, µ) ,
(15.32)
will provide an alternative generating function of commuting operators.
The matrix ř (λ, µ) in equation (15.32) is exactly the R-matrix (12.302) introduced by
Ramos and Martins [371] which played a key role in the construction of the algebraic Bethe
ansatz for the Hubbard model. In our calculation above it appeared quite naturally and
had not to be introduced ad hoc. From Chapter 12.6 we know already that the change of
variables
v(λ) = −i ctg (2λ)ch(2h) = − sin k(λ) + iu = − sin p(λ) − iu

(15.33)

transforms ř (λ, µ) into the rational R-matrix of the XXX spin chain,
ř (λ, µ) =

2iu + (v(λ) − v(µ))P
.
2iu + v(λ) − v(µ)

(15.34)

Part of the general theory of the Yang-Baxter algebra connected with this R-matrix was
developed in Chapter 12.1 and in the appendix to Chapter 14. We learned in particular that

(15.36)

Here λ̌ is determined by the condition that v(λ̌) = v(λ) − 2iu.
In our case the asymptotic expansions (15.35) and (15.36) can be calculated term by term
from equation (15.15). Some care is necessary in the calculation since the limit v(λ) → ∞
can be carried out in several different ways, only one of which leads to ﬁnite results for J0α ,
J1α . We have to take Im(λ) → ∞ and at the same time have to choose the correct branch of
the solution of equation (12.109) which determines h as a function of λ. Solving (12.109) for

e−2h we obtain

(15.37)

In order to achieve convergence of the matrix elements T̃βα (α, β = 2, 3) we have to choose
the lower sign here. Then e−2h(λ) is approximately equal to −2u sin(2λ) for large positive
values of u sin(2λ), and we obtain

The leading terms in the series (15.15) are of order e2iλ , e4iλ , . . . . Thus, from the ﬁrst two
sums in (15.15), we get the expansion of the matrix A(λ) up to the order e4iλ , and the last
equation in (15.38) yields the required expansion in v(λ)−1 up to second order.
We obtain the following explicit expressions for the zeroth and ﬁrst-level Yangian generators,

Here we used again the notation introduced in Chapter 2.2.5. J0α is equal to the operator
S α of the total spin, J1α is up to a prefactor of −u equal to the ﬁrst-level Yangian generator
obtained in Chapter 14 (see (14.19)). The prefactor is conventional and can be attributed
to a different deformation parameter (η = 2iu instead of η = −2i) in the Yangian Serre
relation (see (14.13c), (14.A.89)).

The v(λ)

(15.40)

where H is the Hubbard Hamiltonian in the form (15.1). Thus, we have found the Hamiltonian among the operators in the centre of Y(gl(2)) and at the same time have shown in
a completely different way than in Chapter 14 that the Hubbard Hamiltonian is Yangian
invariant.
In Chapter 14 we have learned that the Shiba transformation (2.59) preserves the deformed
Serre relations (14.A.89) but transforms the representation (15.39) into an independent
representation connected with the η-pairing symmetry and commuting with the original
one. The reason why we obtained only the representation connected with the rotations is that
we performed the inﬁnite interval limit with respect to the vacuum |0 which is rotationally
invariant but breaks the invariance with respect to the non-Abelian gauge transformations
generated by the ηα . A fully SO(4) invariant vacuum would be the singlet ground state at

15.4 Constructing N-particle states

half-ﬁlling. Alas, at present we do not know how to perform an inﬁnite interval limit with
respect to such type of correlated ground state.

15.4 Constructing N-particle states
In this section we construct creation and annihilation operators of elementary excitations
and study their commutation relations. We shall see that the elementary excitations over the
empty band vacuum decay into two classes: electrons (with charge −e and spin ± 12 ) and
bound states (with charge −2me, m ∈ N and spin 0). General excitation are scattering states
of elementary excitations. Our creation and annihilation operators are constructed in such a
way that products of these operators generate normalized scattering states. The information
about the S-matrix is then encoded in the commutation relations of the operators: the
operators provide representations of the Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra whose ‘structure
constants’ are the elements of the two-particle S-matrix.
We also obtain the commutation relations between the generators of the Yangian and
the creation and annihilation operators of the elementary excitations. These commutation
relations allow us to organize the scattering states into Yangian multiplets. It turns out, in
particular, that scattering states of N electrons form a single Yangian multiplet of exponential, 2 N -fold degeneracy. This means that all states in the multiplet can alternatively be
created by acting with the Yangian generators on a Yangian highest-weight state which is
a linear superposition of non-interacting plane waves (all spins point upwards). The bound
states, on the other hand, are all Yangian singlet.

15.4.1 Scattering states of electrons
The commutation relations of the monodromy matrix elements with the number operators
N̂↑ and N̂↓ , (12.275), remain valid in the inﬁnite interval limit, i.e., after replacing T (λ) with
T̃ (λ). This is because V (λ) commutes with I2 ⊗ σ z and σ z ⊗ I2 . Thus, the interpretation
of the elements of T̃ (λ) as creation, annihilation or particle number conserving operators
remains the same as in Chapter 12.6.1. In particular, C11 (λ) and B22 (λ) add one up-spin
electron to a state while C21 (λ) and B21 (λ) add one down-spin electron. D11 (λ) and D22 (λ)
conserve the particle number.
The repeated action of operators B2a (λ), Ca1 (λ) on the vacuum produces N -particle eigenstates of the quantum determinant of A(λ). This follows from the commutation relations
in appendix 15.A.3. For small enough N the associated wave functions can be calculated
from the ‘integral representation’ (15.15). They ﬁnd their natural interpretation as unnormalized scattering states of N particles. In previous studies (e.g. [131, 366, 454]) it turned
out that the standard normalization, with the amplitude of the incident wave equal to unity,
could be obtained by introducing the operator analogue of the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the
corresponding classical inverse scattering problem. For this purpose the creation operators
had to be multiplied by the inverse of generators of conserved quantities.

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

This idea was applied to the Hubbard model in [336], where the following two pairs of
normalized creation operators were proposed:
Fa (λ)† = −ieh cos(λ) Ca1 (λ)D11 (λ)−1 ,

(15.41a)

Z a (λ)† = (−1)3−a ie−h cos(λ) B23−a (λ)D22 (λ)−1

(15.41b)

for a = 1, 2 corresponding to spin-up and spin-down, respectively. The numerical prefactors
have been determined by demanding that the one-particle states generated by Fa (λ)† and
Z a (µ)† be normalized,

Hereafter we assume that k(λ) and p(µ) are real. Then the one-particle wave functions
which can be read off from (15.42) are bounded for m → ±∞ and hence describe physical
excitations.
The behaviour of the monodromy matrix elements T̃βα (λ) under hermitian conjugation
can be easily calculated from (12.277), (15.2), (15.9) and (15.16). The result is shown in
appendix 15.A.1. It can be used to obtain the annihilation operators conjugated to Fa (λ)†
and Z a (λ)† . Let λ = π2 − λ∗ and h  = h(λ ). Then

Fa (λ)Z b (µ)† = −Z b (µ)† Fa (λ) .

(15.44f)

These equations show that the operators Fa (λ), Fa (λ)† and Z a (λ), Z a (λ)† form (right and
left) representations of the (graded) Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra [131, 182, 242–244,
420, 502] with two-particle S-matrix ř (λ, µ). The grading is such that all operators are
odd. The Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra guarantees by construction the factorization of
the N -particle S-matrix into products of two-particle S-matrices. In the context of quantum
ﬁeld theory the Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra is usually treated as a more or less abstract

15.4 Constructing N-particle states

means for handling the S-matrix. Here we are in the fortunate situation to have the explicit
expressions (15.41), (15.43), (15.15).
The aforementioned equations allow us to calculate the action of the FaddeevZamolodchikov operators on the vacuum. With a growing number of particles this task
becomes very cumbersome. However, the two-particle sector can still be worked out by
hand. Using (15.15) and the commutation relations between the elements of the monodromy
matrix we obtain

Note that the two-particle states (15.45a)–(15.45d) generated by Fa (λ)† are in-states if

610

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

explained above. As for the operators Z a (λ)† we observe similar things. The two-particle
states (15.45e)–(15.45h) are normalized in-states if p(λ) > p(µ) and normalized out-states
if p(λ) < p(µ). These facts, together with the examples of other integrable models [366,454]
lead us to the following conjecture:
Conjecture 1. Provided that k(λ j ) is real for j = 1, . . . , N , the N -particle state
Fa1 (λ1 )† . . . Fa N (λ N )† |0

(15.46)

is a normalized in-state if k(λ1 ) < · · · < k(λ N ) and a normalized out-state if k(λ1 ) > · · · >
k(λ N ).
Provided that p(µ j ) is real for j = 1, . . . , N , the N -particle state
Z a1 (µ1 )† . . . Z a N (µ N )† |0

(15.47)

is a normalized in-state if p(µ1 ) > · · · > p(µ N ) and a normalized out-state if p(µ1 ) <
· · · < p(µ N ).
The proof of this conjecture seems difﬁcult for general N since it seems to be unavoidable
to use the series (15.15) and the explicit form (15.17) of L̃m (λ).
We have constructed two pairs (Fa (λ)† and Z a (λ)† , a = 1, 2) of normalized one-particle
creation operators. Similar as in the construction of the algebraic Bethe ansatz eigenstates
in Chapter 12.6, where we could have worked with the creation operators B2a (λ) instead of
Ca1 (λ), not both pairs of Faddeev-Zamolodchikov operators are really needed for constructing multi-particle states. We may use the operator Fa (λ)† only (or Z a (λ)† only). The reason
is the following. From (15.42) we deduce that
Z a (λ)† |0 = Fa (λ̃)† |0 ,

(15.48)

where p(λ) = k(λ̃). Hence, the action of a mixed product of operators Fa (λ)† and Z a (λ)†
on the vacuum can be expressed in the form (15.46) by use of (15.44e) and (15.48). In
particular, one easily obtains
Z a N (λ N )† . . . Z a1 (λ1 )† |0 = (−1)

N (N −1)
2

Fa1 (λ̃1 )† . . . Fa N (λ̃ N )† |0 ,

(15.49)

where p(λ j ) = k(λ̃ j ). The order of the operators is reversed when written in terms of Fa (λ)†
instead of Z a (λ)† .

15.4.2 Action of the Yangian on scattering states of N electrons
Using the commutation relations contained in (15.30) of the submatrix A(λ) of the inﬁnite
interval monodromy matrix with the remaining submatrices B(λ), C(λ), D(λ) and the
asymptotic expansion (15.35) we can calculate the commutators of the Yangian generators
J0α and J1α with B(λ), C(λ) and D(λ). The result is shown in appendix 15.A.2. From the

15.4 Constructing N-particle states

(15.50d)

These formulae induce the adjoint action of the Yangian on multi-particle scattering
states [286, 337].
Taking into account that J0α |0 = J1α |0 = 0 we obtain the action of the Yangian on the
one-particle sector as

J1α Fa (λ)† |0 = − 12 sin k(λ)Fb (λ)† σba

(15.51b)

Since the action of J1α is − sin k(λ) times that of J0α , the representation is called the fundamental representation W1 (− sin k(λ)) [80–82]. In the two-particle sector we obtain

This is a tensor product, W1 (− sin k(λ1 )) ⊗ W1 (− sin k(λ2 )), of two fundamental representations with co-multiplication  deﬁned by
(J0α ) = J0α ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ J0α ,

(15.53a)
β

γ

(J1α ) = J1α ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ J1α + 2u ε αβγ J0 ⊗ J0 .

(15.53b)

The representation is four-dimensional and irreducible since k(λ1 ) and k(λ2 ) are real.
Due to the Yangian invariance of the Hamiltonian the four states in the Yangian multiplet are degenerate. The action of the su(2) sub-algebra associated with the spin degrees
of freedom decomposes the Yangian multiplet into su(2)-triplet and su(2)-singlet, or, to
turn it the other way round, the Yangian mixes spin singlet and spin triplet into a larger
multiplet.
In a similar way the N -particle states Fa1 (λ1 )† . . . Fa N (λ N )† |0 with a j = 1, 2 transform under the Yangian as tensor product representations W1 (− sin k(λ1 )) ⊗ · · · ⊗
W1 (− sin k(λ N )). These representations are irreducible since the quasi-momenta k(λ j ) are
real [80]. However, they are not irreducible with respect to the action of the sub-algebra
su(2). The 2 N N -particle states form a large degenerate multiplet with respect to the
Yangian, but decompose into the usual spin multiplets under the restricted action of its
su(2) sub-algebra.

612

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

The irreducibility of the N -particle multiplet leads us to the conclusion that we can
construct all the N -particle states (15.46) by acting with Yangian generators J0α , J1α on the
Yangian highest-weight state
F1 (λ1 )† . . . F1 (λ N )† |0 .

(15.54)

The wave function of the highest weight state (15.54) must be of plane-wave form, since due
to the Pauli principle the on-site interaction does not affect particles of like spin. Therefore,
assuming that the state (15.54) is normalized (see Conjecture 1), we conjecture that the
above state (15.54) is equal to the superposition of plane waves
†

†

c↑ (k(λ1 )) . . . c↑ (k(λ N ))|0 ,

(15.55)


†
†
where ca (k) = j∈Z c j,a e−i jk . Thus, we have found an alternative method for constructing
multi-particle scattering states. They can also be obtained by applying the Yangian to planewave states of the form (15.55). A similar situation was encountered in case of the Fermi
gas with repulsive δ-function interaction [337] which is the proper continuum limit of the
Hubbard model in the zero-density phase (see appendix 2.B).
Yangian representations of multi-particle states can of course also be constructed by use of
a
Z (λ)† . The alert reader will have noticed the only small difference which is in the different
signs in front of u in equations (15.50b) and (15.50d), leading to different deﬁnitions of the
co-multiplication. Instead of (15.53) we obtain
 (J0α ) = J0α ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ J0α ,

(15.56a)
β

γ

 (J1α ) = J1α ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ J1α − 2u ε αβγ J0 ⊗ J0 .

(15.56b)

But this does not cause any harm. The order of the quasi-momenta in (15.49) is reversed in
the multi-particle states expressed in terms of Fa (λ)† compared to those expressed in terms
of Z a (λ)† . This corresponds to the reversed order of the tensor product ⊗ in the deﬁnition
of the co-multiplication, which compensates the different sign in front of u in (15.53b) and
(15.56b).

15.4.3 Free electron limit
The various parameters u, λ, h, v, k and p which we used so far are connected through
the formulae (12.109) and (15.33). Thus, only two of them are independent. As a test of
consistency of the results in this section let us consider the free fermion limit u → 0. This
limit is most conveniently taken for ﬁxed v, for if we ﬁx v = v(λ) and v̄ = v(µ) in equations
(15.45a)–(15.45h) and let u approach 0, we see that the products of operators Fa (λ)† and
†
Z a (λ)† act like products of creation operators of Bloch states ca (k0 ) on the vacuum. Here
k0 = p0 is determined by the corresponding limit in equation (15.33),
sin k0 = −v .

(15.57)

15.4 Constructing N-particle states

613

λ and h are now dependent variables. Considering (12.109) and (15.33) for ﬁxed v and
small u we ﬁnd the following solutions
i ctg λ = 1 + u(1 − v 2 )− 2 + O(u 2 ) ,
1

(15.58a)

1

e2h = i(1 − v 2 ) 2 − v + O(u 2 ) .

(15.58b)

Using these equations and some standard trigonometric identities we can express all the
functions of h and λ, which enter the deﬁnition of L̃m (λ) (see (15.17)) in terms of v and u.
Note that equations (15.58) are not the only possible solution of (12.109) and (15.33) for
ﬁxed v and small u. We chose the branches such that limu→0 L̃m (λ)|v = I4 . For small u the
1
odd elements of L̃m (λ) − I4 are of the order of u 2 and the even elements are of the order of
1
u. Thus, only the ﬁrst sum on the right hand side of (15.15) contributes in order u 2 to the
odd elements of T̃ (λ) − I4 , and we obtain

a = 1, 2 .

(15.60)

The corresponding formulae for Fa (λ) and Z a (λ) are true by hermitian conjugation. Equations (15.44a)–(15.44f) turn into the usual anticommutators between Fermi operators since
lim ř (λ, µ) v,v̄ = P ,

u→0

(15.61)

where P is the permutation matrix. Hence, it is natural to interpret the Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra as a deformation with deformation parameter u of the canonical anticommutation relations between Fermi operators.

15.4.4 Bound states and scattering states of bound states
One of the delicate points in Bethe ansatz calculations is the question of completeness. For a
lattice model in a ﬁnite volume completeness can in principle be established by counting the
ﬁnitely many linearly independent Bethe ansatz eigenstates and possibly using symmetries
of the model. This programme is not as easy to apply in practice as it may seem at ﬁrst
sight. It is neither easy to show the linear independence of the coordinate Bethe ansatz wave
function, nor to determine the number of solutions of a typical set of Bethe ansatz equations.
Proofs based on counting therefore usually rely on a number of further assumptions, the
most important of which is that an appropriately formulated string hypothesis gives the
correct number of (regular) Bethe ansatz states. Depending on the reader’s taste such kind
of proof may rather be called a consistency test. For the Hubbard model subject to periodic

614

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

boundary conditions it was obtained in [123, 125] and is discussed at length in appendix B
of Chapter 4.
Within our inﬁnite chain formalism the question of completeness is even more difﬁcult
to answer. All we can offer here is that we construct the inﬁnite-interval bound states that
correspond to the k- string states in the ﬁnite volume. As we have seen in the preceding
section the operators Fa (λ)† and Z a (λ)† create single electrons in scattering states. These
correspond to solutions of the Lieb-Wu equations (3.95), (3.96) with real quasi momenta k j .
From the commutation relations of the inﬁnite-interval monodromy matrix with the particle
number operator we know that the only other candidate creation operator except for B2a (λ),
Ca1 (λ) is the operator D21 (λ) which adds two particles to the system. The action of D21 (λ) on
the empty band is easily calculated from (15.15),

We have to take into account here that k(λ) and p(λ) are not independent, but are connected
by the constraint (15.33), sin k − sin p = 2iu. Furthermore, for the wave function in (15.62)
to be bounded we need to have Im(k + p) = 0 and Im(k − p) < 0. With these conditions
(15.62) describes precisely the bound state of two electrons obtained in Section 3.2.4 within
the coordinate Bethe ansatz. In Section 4.2 we showed that this state can be interpreted as
an exact k--2 string.
There are no operators that create more than two particles among the elements of the
monodromy matrix. However, the string hypothesis suggests the existence of bound states
of pairs. In order to obtain an idea of how to deﬁne the corresponding bound-state operators
let us recall the string hypothesis. We will denote the spin rapidities of the coordinate Bethe
ansatz by  j and the charge momenta by k j . According to Chapter 4 there are two types of
string solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations:
(i) (-string) m  j ’s form a string conﬁguration in which the real parts of the  j ’s are
identical, while the imaginary parts are arranged at equal spacing 2iu. The centre of the
string should be real.
(ii) (k--string) 2m ki ’s and m  j ’s form a string conﬁguration. The values of the ki ’s and
 j ’s are
k1 = π − arcsin( + imu) ,
k2 = arcsin( + i(m − 2)u) ,
k3 = π − k2 ,
..
.

(15.63)

k2m−2 = arcsin( − i(m − 2)u) ,
k2m−1 = π − k2m−2 ,
k2m = π − arcsin( − imu) ,
 j =  + i(m + 1 − 2 j)u ,

 real ,

j = 1, 2, . . . , m .

15.4 Constructing N-particle states

615

We expect these solutions to represent exact bound states in the inﬁnite interval limit. Since
we are dealing with the zero density vacuum, there should be no spin excitations, and we
do not have to consider the -string here.
We shall now introduce an alternative construction of the bound state (15.62) which can
be generalized to bound states of more particles. Using (15.15) and (15.17) it follows that
the bound state (15.62) is proportional to C21 (λ )C11 (λ )|0 , if λ and λ satisfy the following
conditions;
p(λ ) = π − k(λ ) mod 2π ,

(15.64a)

k(λ ) = p(λ) mod 2π ,

(15.64b)

k(λ ) = k(λ) mod 2π .

(15.64c)

These are three conditions for three parameters λ, λ , λ which at ﬁrst sight seems to violate
the arbitrariness of λ. Yet, there is a redundancy in these equations. (15.64a) and (15.64b)
imply that
p(λ ) = π − p(λ) mod 2π ,

(15.65)

which is compatible with (15.64c) by taking into account the constraint (15.33). Thus, we
have obtained two possible 2-string creation operators, which are connected to each other
by the relation

1 − ei( p(λ )−k(λ ))

(15.66)

λ, λ and λ in this equation have to satisfy (15.64). Note that it follows from (15.30) that
C21 (λ )C11 (λ ) = −C11 (λ )C21 (λ ) .

(15.67)

We can now proceed with the general 2m-string states. We conjecture that the creation
operator of a k--2m-string can (up to an overall normalization factor) be expressed as
C (2m) (λ1 , . . . , λ2m ) = C21 (λ1 )C11 (λ2 )C21 (λ3 )C11 (λ4 ) . . . C21 (λ2m−1 )C11 (λ2m ) ,

(15.68)

where
k(λ2s ) + p(λ2s−1 ) = π mod 2π ,
sin k(λ2s−1 ) = sin k(λ1 ) + 2(s − 1)iu ,

(15.69a)
s = 1, . . . , m .

(15.69b)

Following previous works [166, 167, 275, 278, 279, 421, 508] we shall call this operator a
bound-state operator. The questions of the domain of existence of the term on the right
hand side and of its analytic properties are rather delicate. An interpretation as a ‘composite
operator’ was proposed in appendix C of [336]. Here we treat C (2m) (λi ) rather formally
and assume that the commutation relations of this operator with arbitrary elements of the
inﬁnite-interval monodromy matrix are given by (12.280) for all allowed values of spectral

616

S-matrix and Yangian symmetry in the inﬁnite interval limit

parameters. One can easily verify that the functions sin k(λi ) in (15.69a) form the same
conﬁguration as in the k--string, if their centre
ζ =

2m
1 
sin k(λi ) = sin k(λ1 ) + (m − 2)iu
2m i=1

(15.70)

is real.
We can normalize the bound-state operator by a similar method as used for the creation
operators of electrons Fa (λ)† . Let
D (2m) (λ1 , . . . , λ2m ) = D11 (λ1 )D11 (λ2 )D11 (λ3 )D11 (λ4 ) . . . D11 (λ2m−1 )D11 (λ2m ) .

(15.71)

Then we deﬁne a normalized bound-state operator as
F (2m) (λ1 , . . . , λ2m )† = C (2m) (λ1 , . . . , λ2m )D (2m) (λ1 , . . . , λ2m )−1 .

(15.72)

Similar deﬁnitions of bound-state operators have been used before in the context of the
XXZ-chain [275, 278, 279] and the Bose gas with attractive δ-function interaction [166,
167, 368, 508].
Formally using the commutation relations (15.30) for the elements of the monodromy
matrix we obtain for our bound state operators

(15.73)

(15.74)

where ζ is the centre of the 2m-string and η the centre of the 2n-string. As before, we
interpret these relations as Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra. This time particles without
internal degrees of freedom are involved. Then the factor on the right-hand side of (15.73)
is the S-matrix for the scattering of a bound state represented by a 2m-string on another
bound state with spectral parameters of a 2n-string. Similarly, the factor on the right-hand
side of (15.74) is the S-matrix describing the scattering of a 2m-string by an electron. The
bound-state bound-state S-matrix in (15.73) is of the same form as for the scattering of
bound states of magnons in the XXX-chain [278, 279].
As for the transformation under the Yangian we can easily see that
[J0α , F (2m) (λi )† ] = [J1α , F (2m) (λi )† ] = 0 ,

(15.75)

which follows from the commutation relations shown in appendix 15.A.2. We conclude that
the k--2m-string states are Yangian singlets,
J0α F (2m) (λi )† |0 = 0 ,

15.5 Eigenvalues of quantum determinant and Hamiltonian
In the previous section we constructed independent sets of creation operators Fa (λ)† and
F (2m) (λ1 , . . . , λ2m )† (see (15.41a), (15.72)). Using the commutation relations (15.A.6) and
detq A(µ)|0 = |0 we conclude that the scattering states created by these operators are
eigenstates of the quantum determinant of A(µ), e.g.,

by Z a (λ)† and for states involving bound states. In order to calculate the corresponding

to second order in v(µ)−1 ,

Applying a similar procedure to general states also involving bound states we reproduce
the formula (4.52) which was obtained on the basis of the string

It follows from our considerations
that the operator ln detq (A(µ)) has an ‘additive

spectrum’, i.e., applying ln detq (A(µ)) to multiple scattering states produces a sum over
terms which each depends only on λ j , j = 1, . . . , N . This observation was used
 in [336] to
obtain a conjecture about how the higher conserved operators generated by ln detq (A(µ))
are related to the conserved operators [183, 187] previously constructed by hand.

15.6 Conclusions
This section was devoted to an algebraic study of the Hubbard model on the inﬁnite interval.
Our presentation closely followed [335,336], where the relation between Shastry’s R-matrix
and the Y(su(2)) Yangian was ﬁrst explained. We saw how the Yangian acts on scattering
states and we constructed explicit representations of the Faddeev-Zamolodchikov algebra
providing us in a simple way with the bare S-matrix of the Hubbard model.

Appendices to Chapter 15

15.A Some useful formulae
This appendix contains a collection of formulae that could be useful for those readers who
wish to verify the results of the present chapter.
15.A.1 Conjugation properties of the inﬁnite interval monodromy matrix
The behaviour of the monodromy matrix elements under hermitian conjugation are obtained
by combining equation (12.277) with the deﬁnitions (15.2) and (15.16), (15.17):
A(λ)† = σ y A( π2 − λ∗ )σ y ,

(15.A.1)

B(λ)† = −iσ y B( π2 − λ∗ )σ y ,

(15.A.2)

C(λ)† = −iσ y C( π2 − λ∗ )σ y ,

(15.A.3)

D(λ)† = σ y D( π2 − λ∗ )σ y .

(15.A.4)

As in (12.277) the dagger in these equations means hermitian conjugation of the matrix
elements but not of the 2 × 2 matrices.
15.A.2 Elements of the monodromy matrix under Yangian transformations
The commutation relations of the elements of the inﬁnite-interval monodromy matrix contained in the submatrices B(λ), C(λ) and D(λ) with the Yangian generators are obtained
by extracting those of A(λ) with these matrices from (15.30) and inserting the asymptotic
expansion (15.35),
[J0α , B(λ)] = − 12 σ α B(λ) ,

Hubbard model in the attractive case

In this Chapter we discuss attractive case of the Hubbard model. We follow the papers [485]
and [121].

We shall consider the case of even L [number of sites of the chain]. The energy levels of
the model are given by
E = −2



cos kl − 2u Ne + u L .

(16.2)

l=1

Here Ne is the number of electrons and kl are the momenta of individual electrons. Later
we shall add a magnetic ﬁeld and chemical potential to the Hamiltonian.
In the attractive case u < 0 we can solve the model independently, using a technique
similar to the one of the repulsive case. On the other hand we can use symmetries of the
model to reduce the attractive case to the repulsive one. Let us mention relevant symmetries:
The model is invariant under the space reﬂection: j ↔ L − j + 1.
†
Partial particle-hole transformation is also important: c j,↑ ↔ c j,↑ ; c j,↓ ↔ (−1) j c j,↓ .
Combination of these two can be represented as a nice unitary transformation:
†

W1 c j,↑ W1−1 = c L− j+1,↑ ;

W1 c j,↓ W1−1 = (−1) L− j+1 c L− j+1,↓

(16.3)

Here W1 is an involution W12 = I . Here by I we mean the identify operator. The involution
can be represented as an exponent of a sum of local operators: W1 = exp[i Sˆ1 ] = W1−1
and

The involution changes the sign of the Hamiltonian:

(16.5)

The operator of number of electrons and the third component of spin are transformed in the
following way:
W1 N̂ W1 = L + N̂↓ − N̂↑ ,

W1 ( N̂↑ − N̂↓ )W1 = L − N̂

(16.6)

The involution replaces charge and spin degrees of freedom.

The Hamiltonian change the sign and repulsion is replaced by attraction:
W2 H0 (u)W2 = −H0 (−u),

(16.8)

The operator of number of electrons and the third component of spin does not change under
W2 .
The product of both involutions act like this:
W2 W1 H0 (u)W1 W2 = H0 (−u);

W2 W1 N̂ W1 W2 = L − ( N̂↑ − N̂↓ );

W2 W1 ( N̂↑ − N̂↓ )W1 W2 = L − N̂

(16.9)

This product replaces repulsion by attraction in an intelligent way. It maps low-lying
states into low-lying states. In 1983 F. Woynarovich found the action of these involutions
on Bethe Ansatz [485]. We already presented eigenfunctions of the Hubbard Hamiltonian
earlier in the book . These states parameterized by set of Ne momenta {kl } and another set
of M spin rapidities {λα }. Sometimes λα called spectral parameters. They satisfy Lieb-Wu
equations [298] :

(16.10)

Here Ne and M should belong to a fundamental region: Ne ≤ L and M ≤ Ne /2.
We denote corresponding eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian by |{kl }, {λα }, u .
We can deﬁne operator of momentum P̂ in a formal way. It is an operator with eigen Ne
functions |{kl }, {λα }, u and eigenvalues P = l=1
kl .
Woynarovich found that the involutions W act on eigenstates in the following way:
W2 |{kl }, {λα }, u = |{kl + π }, {−λα }, −u
W1 |{kl }, {λα }, u = |{k g }, {λα }, u

(16.11)

622

Hubbard model in the attractive case

Here {k g } are holes. Let us deﬁne these holes formally. The ﬁrst of the Lieb-Wu equations
can be considered as an equation for one kl [at ﬁxed λα ]. It can be represented as an equation
for the roots of a polynomial:
P(x) = x

(16.12)

α=1

Here xl = exp[ikl ]. The power of the polynomial is L + 2M, so it has L + 2M roots. We
use only Ne of them to construct the eigenfunction |{kl }, {λα }, u . We denote by {x g } the L +
2M − Ne remaining roots. Corresponding k g appear in the eigenfunctions after an action
of W1 involution. We call them holes. Please note that the new eigenfunction |{k g }, {λα }, u
still belongs to a fundamental region L + 2M − Ne ≤ L and 2M ≤ L + 2M − Ne . In
Appendix 16.A we show that k g satisfy Lieb-Wu equation with the same set of λα . In the
same Appendix 16.A we shall also see that involutions act on the momentum in the following
way:
W2 P̂ W2 = P̂ + π Ne , mod(2π )
W1 P̂ W1 = π (L + 1) + π M − P̂,

mod(2π ).

(16.13)

Since L is even we can drop it from the right-hand side. Now we can combine both
involutions into an equation:
W1 W2 P̂ W2 W1 = π (N↑ + 1) − P̂,

mod(2π )

(16.14)

We shall call the product W1 W2 Woynarovich mapping. In the following sections we shall
use it to construct the ground state and excitations in the attractive case, starting from the
repulsive one.

16.1 Half-ﬁlled case
16.1.1 Ground state
Let us start our analysis of the ground state from the half ﬁlled case [no magnetic ﬁeld]. In the
repulsive case the ground state was invariant under Yangian symmetry [the eigenfunction of
the ground state was annihilated by all generators of Yangian]. This high symmetry is more
typical for quantum ﬁeld theory then for condensed matter. This was the reason why we
were able to solve all integral equations explicitly and get an expression for the ground-state
energy in terms of special functions. This is the reason why the half-ﬁlled band is in the
centre of the phase diagram. In the repulsive case for the ground state we had Ne = L and
2M = Ne . The product of two involutions W2 W1 (Woynarovich mapping) maps it to the
ground state of the attractive case. We shall denote ground state in the inﬁnite volume by
|gs . The number of electrons and spin does not change L + 2M − Ne = L and 2M = Ne .
In the repulsive case λ ﬁlled a symmetric interval. So the set of {λ} does not change under
Woynarovich mapping. Also the set of real {kl } is mapped into a set of complex {kl }. In the

16.1 Half-ﬁlled case

623

attractive case the ground state is ﬁlled with bound states:
sin k ± = λ ± iu + O(exp(−L),

Imλ = 0

(16.15)

This is a bound state of an electron with spin up and an electron with spin down. It is
called k − λ string. Root density of {λ} in the attractive case is the same as it was in the
repulsive:

σ (λ) =

(16.17)

Woynarovich matched the expressions for e(u) from repulsive and attractive sides. He
proved that both e(u) and de(u)/du are continuous across u = 0. Decomposition of e(u)
into Taylor series in u/π can be found in [439]:

.

The series is divergent; it is actually an asymptotic series. This indicates a singularity at
u = 0. The singularity might be related to charge and spin separation. At u = 0 excitation,
electrons carry charge and spin. For other values of u charge and spin separates.
We also need to notice that coefﬁcients of asymptotic series can be expressed in terms of
the values of the Riemann ζ function at odd arguments and rational coefﬁcients. The values
of the Riemann ζ function at odd arguments are important objects of number theory; they
are conjectured to be algebraically independent transcendental numbers. This has profound
consequences for correlation functions of the XXX spin chain.
Under Woynarovich mapping spin and charge degrees of freedom change places. Spin
SU (2) interchanges with η − SU (2). In the attractive case the ground state is also invariant
under both SU (2) [both spins are equal to zero]. It is a one-dimensional representation of
each SU (2). The ground state is also invariant under the whole Yangian of S O(4), as it was
in the repulsive case.

Hubbard model in the attractive case

16.1.2 Excitations
The product of the two involutions W2 W1 maps exited states into exited states. Charge and
spin degrees of freedom interchange. Charge and spin separate as they did in the repulsive
case [120, 121].
Spin wave has a gap:

(16.19)
(16.20)

It does not carry electrical charge. It has spin 1/2. This is actually the spinon. The η
‘spin’ of these excitations is zero.
Charge-waves (the spinless charged carriers) have the dispersions

(16.21)
(16.22)

These excitations can be called holon and antiholon. The holon has electrical charge
opposite to the electrical charge of an electron and the antiholon has electrical charge equal
to the electrical charge of an electron. The expression for the momentum of holon and
antiholon differs by π . These excitations are gapless. They have spin equal to zero. The η
‘spin’ of these excitation is 12 .
This is the complete list of all elementary excitations at half ﬁlled band in zero magnetic
ﬁeld. All other energy levels are scattering states of these elementary excitations [120,121].
One can also calculate the scattering matrix of these excitations. Scattering matrix is the
same as in the repulsive case, one should only relabel excitations [ change charge and spin
degrees of freedom].
Another important object is a Fermi velocity:

value of chemical potential µc = 2|u| − 2 1 + u 2 corresponds to an empty lattice. The
density of the ground state D = Ne /L monotonically depends on µ. Spin of the ground
state is still equal to zero.
Let us brieﬂy discuss excitations. The simplest excitation seems to be a hole. The energy
of the hole can be denoted by ε(λ). It satisﬁes an integral equation:

If we map this excitation to repulsive case [by Woynarovich mapping] it will turn into a
magnon [at half ﬁlled band in a magnetic ﬁeld]. In the previous chapters we showed that
the magnon is not an elementary excitation [below critical ﬁeld]; a magnon is a scattering
state of two spinons. We can apply a similar analysis here in the attractive case. It will show
that the hole, which we considered above not to be an elementary excitation, consists of
two holons. Dispersions of the holons can be obtained from dispersions of the spinons [in
the repulsive case] by Woynarovich mapping.

(16.35)

At small magnetic ﬁeld the ground state is ﬁlled with k − λ strings. These are bound
states of an electron with spin up and another electron with spin down. If the magnetic ﬁeld
is strong enough it will break the pairs. The energy of one electron with spin up embedded
into the ground state below half ﬁlling is:
 
E e (k) = −2 cos k + 2|u| − µ − B − 2

(16.37)

(16.38)

At a larger magnetic ﬁeld then critical free electrons with spin up will start ﬁlling up the
ground state. This means that the ground state will consist of two Fermi spheres: one consists
of k − λ strings with real λ, another consists of real k [free electrons with spin up]. The reason
why a broken pair is not replaced by one electron with spin up and another electron with
spin down is because we are considering a grand canonical ensemble. We ﬁx the magnetic

16.4 Phase diagram

627

ﬁeld and a chemical potential, and then we compare energies in the sectors with different
quantum numbers. Electrons with spin up have lowest energy because of the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld. If we increase magnetic ﬁeld even further then more k − λ strings will
be replaces by electrons with spin up. When the magnetic ﬁeld passes the second critical
value
Bc2 = 2 + 2|u|

(16.39)

the ground state will be ﬁlled only with electrons with spin up; all k − λ strings will
disappear.

16.4 Phase diagram
In the attractive case the phase diagram can be obtained by 90 degree rotation from the
repulsive case. In ﬁgure 16.1 we present only the fundamental part of the phase diagram.
The rest of the phase diagram can be obtained by particle -hole transformation and by
replacing electrons with spin up by electrons with spin down. In order to obtain our phase
diagram in the attractive case we take the phase diagram from the repulsive case and replace
B by (−µ) and µ by (−B). Actually, ground-state energy E G S (µ, B, T, u) has the following symmetry: E G S (µ, B, T, u) = E G S (−B, −µ, T, −u) − µ − B. Let us comment on the
phases.
Phase I is an empty lattice. Boundaries are given by the same equations as in the repulsive
case. For example

Phase II is less than half ﬁlled and fully polarized. The ground state is ﬁlled only with
electrons with spin up and there are fewer electrons than lattice sites. The critical point is
Bc2 = 2 + 2|u|.

(16.41)

Phase III is half ﬁlled and fully polarized. The number of electrons is equal to the number
of lattice cites, all spins are up spins.
Phase IV is less than half ﬁlled and partially polarized. The ground state is ﬁlled with
k − λ strings [bound state of an electron with spin up and another electron with spin down]
and real k [electrons with spin up].

Phase V is less then half ﬁlled. It has no polarization [spin is equal to zero]. The ground
state is ﬁlled only with k − λ strings.
The origin µ = B = 0 corresponds to the half ﬁlled band [no polarization]. This state is
invariant under Yangian symmetry. This is the centre of the phase diagram.
The rest of the phase diagram can be restored by symmetry. The phase diagram is symmetric for free electrons and for the repulsive Hubbard model. Here the same symmetry
holds.

16.5 Critical behaviour
At T = 0 some correlation functions decay algebraically, others exponentially. In this
section we will be interested only in correlation functions, which decay algebraically. These
correlations can be described by conformal ﬁeld theory [Virasoro algebra]. Conformal
dimensions [critical exponents] and the central charge can be extracted from the ﬁnite
size corrections. This is the same calculation we did in the repulsive case; only now spin
degrees of freedom are gapped. So we have only one conformal ﬁeld theory with central
charge equal to c = 1. It describes correlations of operators, which do not change spin.
Critical behaviour in a sense is close to Bose gas. It is very well understood, see Chapter
XVIII of [270]. Conformal dimensions can be described in terms of the dressed charge. It is
a special value of a function Z (λ). The function is deﬁned by an integral equation, similar
to (16.29):
 
Z (λ) +
K (λ, ν)Z (ν)dν = 1.
(16.43)
−

The dressed charge is the value of this function at the edge of integration Z (). Below we
shall also use
γ −1 = 2Z 2 ().

(16.44)

Analysis of the integral equation shows that γ is a monotonic function of the density D.
The integral equation for the dressed charge has been studied in detail in papers [65–67]. It

16.5 Critical behaviour

was proved that γ changes in the interval:
1
≤ γ ≤ 1.
2

(16.45)

The γ approaches 12 in the low density limit, it goes to 1 for the half ﬁlled band. It will be
important to us that
γ ≤

1
.
γ

(16.46)

It turns into equality only for the half ﬁlled band. Let us consider examples of some
correlations. Let us start with the superconducting correlation function. The formula, which
describes the long distance asymptotic as |x| → ∞ is:
†

†

cx,↑ cx,↓ c1,↑ c1,↓ ∼

1
.
|x|γ

(16.47)

Let us also mention the correlation function of local densities. Its asymptotic behaviour
contains oscillations:
†

†

†

cx,↑ cx,↑ c1,↑ c1,↑ − c1,↑ c1,↑ 2 ∼

cos(2π x D)
1

|x| γ

,

|x| → ∞

(16.48)

†

Let us mention that the Green function cx,↑ c1,↑ decays exponentially. Now we can
compare asymptotic of the superconducting correlation function with density-density correlation. The inequality γ ≤ 1/γ shows that the superconducting correlation function decays slower than density-density correlation. This means that super conducting correlations
dominate. More details on the conformal description of correlation functions in the attractive Hubbard model can be found in [65–67, 140]. Multi-point correlations also can be
described by conformal ﬁeld theory.
Entropy also can be described by conformal ﬁeld theory. At zero temperature the ground
state |gs is unique and the entropy of the whole inﬁnite ground state is zero. Nevertheless
there is some entropy in a subsystem [part of the ground state]. Let us consider electrons
present on some space interval (0, x) in the ground state. They can be described by a density
matrix:
ρ = tr∞ (|gs gs|)
Here we trace out the degrees of freedom of electrons on the uniﬁcation of intervals
(−∞, 0) ∪ (x, ∞). The entropy of the electrons on the interval (0, x) can be deﬁned as
von Neumann entropy of the density matrix:
S(x) = −trx ρ ln ρ
Here we are taking the trace with respect to degrees of freedom of electrons on the interval
(0, x). It is difﬁcult to calculate S(x); nevertheless for large x it simpliﬁes. In Appendix 16.B

630

Hubbard model in the attractive case

we show that the asymptotic can be described by conformal ﬁeld theory:
1
ln x.
3
Notice that speciﬁc entropy s = lim(S(x)/x) as x → ∞ vanishes according to the third law
of thermodynamics. This result tells us that ground-state electrons from the interval (0, x)
can be in
S(x) →

n = exp[S(x)] = x 1/3
different states |x, j here j = 1, . . . , n. Outside electrons, from the intervals (−∞, 0) ∪
(x, ∞) also can be in n different states |∞, j . The wave function of the ground state can
be represented in the form:
|gs =

n


|x, j |∞, j

j=1

Since n is large this describes entanglement of electrons from the interval (0, x) with the
rest of the ground state.
16.6 Thermodynamics
Partition function of the model is deﬁned by
Z = tr[e−H (u)/T ]

(16.49)

In the thermodynamic limit (L → ∞ , Ne → ∞, density n = Ne /L ﬁxed) the partition
function can be asymptotically represented as :
−fL

Z =e T

(16.50)

Here f is bulk free energy. We already described thermodynamics in the repulsive case in the
frame of the Yang-Yang approach. Thermodynamics was described in terms of Takahahsi’s
equations. In the attractive case we can use the same equations; now the coupling constant
u will take negative values in these equations, see [287, 288] .
Another approach to thermodynamics in the attractive case is based on symmetries mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. One can use the symmetries to relate the bulk free
energy in the attractive and repulsive cases:
f (µ, B, T, u) = f (−B, −µ, T, −u) − µ − B.

(16.51)

This describes the bulk free energy in the attractive case.
One can study analytical properties of f as a function of coupling constant u. The bulk
free energy behaves differently from the the ground state energy e(u). The bulk free energy
f does not have a singularity at u = 0, see [21].
Let us now discuss the entropy. Speciﬁc entropy s increases with temperature. So we
shall discuss two limiting cases of small temperature and large temperature.

16.6 Thermodynamics

631

At small temperature entropy density [speciﬁc entropy] vanishes linearly, see [6]:
s=

S
πT
=
.
L
3v

(16.52)

Here v is Fermi velocity.
At very large temperature entropy also simpliﬁes [because of a different reason]. Notice
that we ﬁxed the density n = Ne /L. We can express the speciﬁc entropy of the Hubbard
model at inﬁnite temperature s∞ in terms of Boltzmann entropy:
S B ( p) = − p ln p − (1 − p) ln(1 − p)
Here p is a probability.
At inﬁnite temperature different lattice sites are independent. If magnetic ﬁeld B =
0 then half of the electrons have spin up another half have spin down. For an electron
with spin up the probability of its presence in a lattice site is p = n/2. This means that
a contribution of electrons with spin up to the speciﬁc entropy of the Hubbard model is
S B (n/2). Electrons with spin down will give the same contribution to the entropy. So the
total speciﬁc entropy of the Hubbard model at ﬁxed density and inﬁnite temperature is
s∞ = 2S B (n/2):
s∞ = ln 4 − n ln n − (2 − n) ln(2 − n),

T = ∞,

B = 0,

n is ﬁxed
(16.53)

This agrees with the Takahashi equations. Let us emphasize again that entropy increases
monotonically with temperature from its values at small temperature to its values at large
temperature.
We can also study the entropy of electrons S(x) on the space interval (0, x). According
to the second law of thermodynamics S(x) is proportional to the length of the interval:
S(x) = sx

(16.54)

Now let us comment on correlation functions. At small temperatures the correlation function can be calculated by conformal mapping. Now they decay exponentially. Asymptotic
of superconducting correlation is given by the following expression:
†

†

cx,↑ cx,↓ c1,↑ c1,↓ ∼ exp [−

πTγ
x].
v

(16.55)

Asymptotic of the correlation function of charge-density waves is:
†

†

†

cx,↑ cx,↑ c1,↑ c1,↑ − c1,↑ (0)c1,↑ (0) 2 ∼ cos(2π n D) exp [−

πT

γv

(16.56)

Some times nonlocal correlation are also interesting. An example is emptiness-formation
probability P(x). It is a probability that [because of ﬂuctuations] there will be no electrons

on a space interval of the length x. It is difﬁcult to calculate, but large x asymptotic is
simple:


−P x
P(x) ∼ exp
(16.57)
T
Here P is a pressure: P = −( f − u). This formula follows from Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistics, because P x is work necessary to remove electrons from the interval (0, x).

16.B Appendix B
Here we follow the argument of the paper [269]. Conformal ﬁeld theory [51] is useful for
the description of low-temperature behaviour of gapless models in one space and one time
dimensions. We are interested in speciﬁc entropy s [entropy per unit length]. Let us start
with speciﬁc heat C = T ds/dT . Low-temperature behaviour was obtained in [6]:
C=

πTc
,
3v

as

T →0

(16.B.1)

Here c is a central charge of corresponding Virasoro algebra and v is Fermi velocity. We
are more interested in s. We can integrate the equation and ﬁx the integration constant from

636

Appendices to Chapter 16

the third law of thermodynamics (s = 0 at T = 0). So for speciﬁc entropy we have the same
low temperature behaviour:
s=

πTc
,
3v

as

T →0

(16.B.2)

We consider entropy of electrons on the interval (0, x). The second law of thermodynamics
states that the entropy is extensive parameter. So the entropy of electrons on the interval
S(x) is proportional to the size x:
S(x) = sx

T > 0.

at

(16.B.3)

The laws of thermodynamics are applicable to a subsystem of macroscopic size, meaning
large x. Here speciﬁc entropy s depends on the temperature. For small temperature the
dependence simpliﬁes, see (16.B.2):
S(x) =

πTc

3v

T

(16.B.4)

Let us ﬁnd how S(x) depends on x for zero temperature. It is some function of the size x:
S(x) = f (x),

at

T =0

(16.B.5)

Now let us apply the ideas of conformal ﬁeld theory, see [6, 51] and also Chapter XVIII
of [270]. We can arrive at small temperatures from zero temperature by conformal mapping
exp [2π T z/v]. It maps the whole complex plane of z without the origin to a strip of the
width 1/T . This replaces zero temperature by positive temperature T . The function f does
not change, only its argument does. The conformal mapping results in a replacement of
the variable x [argument of the function] by [v/π T ] sinh[π T x/v]. Now the entropy of a
subsystem is given by the formula:



v
πT x
S(x) = f
sinh
, at T > 0
(16.B.6)
πT
v
So at positive temperature the entropy of a subsystem is described in terms of the same
function with a different argument. In order to ﬁnd the function f we should match two
different expressions for asymptotic of S(x) for positive temperature. For large x the formula
(16.B.6) simpliﬁes:



π T (x − x0 )
S(x) = f exp
, T x → ∞.
(16.B.7)
v
Here π T x0 /v = − ln(v/2π T ) . This formula should coincide with (16.B.4). Both represent the entropy of a subsystem for small positive temperatures. This provides an equation
for f :

π T (x − x0 )
πTc
f exp

(16.B.8)

16.B Appendix B

637

This formula describes asymptotic of large x, so we have added −x0 to the right-hand
side. In the low-temperature case x  x0 . We are considering the region x > 1/T and
x0 ∼ ln(1/T ) at T → 0.
In order to solve the equation for f , let us introduce a new variable y =
exp [π T (x − x0 )/v]. Then the last equation turns into:
c
f (y) = ln y
(16.B.9)
3
Thus we have found how the function f depends on its argument. The dependence will
not change as we change the notation of the argument from y to x. So at zero temperature
entropy of electrons containing on the interval (0, x) is:
c
S (x) = ln x as x → ∞, T = 0
(16.B.10)
3
Let us remember that for the attractive Hubbard model c = 1, see [65].

f (x) = f (0) (x) − K X ∗ f (x) .
Here K X is an integral operator which acts on a function f (x) as
 X
dy K (x − y) f (y).
K X ∗ f (x) =

(17.21)

(17.22)

−X

For simplicity we assume that the both the kernel K (x) of the integral operator and the
‘driving term’ f (0) (x) are even functions
K (x) = K (−x) ,

f (0) (−x) = f (0) (x) ,

(17.23)

which are deﬁned on the entire real axis. The integration boundary X is supposed to be
large but ﬁnite. The operator 1 + K∞ is non-degenerate and its resolvent K̄, deﬁned as
(1 + K∞ )−1 ≡ 1 − K̄

(17.24)

can be obtained e.g. by Fourier transformation. Following Yang and Yang [495] we now
rewrite (17.21) as
 −X  ∞
(1 + K∞ ) ∗ f (x) = f (0) (x) +
+
dy K (x − y) f (y).
(17.25)
−∞

X

Acting with (1 + K∞ )−1 on both sides of (17.25) we arrive at
 −X  ∞
+
f (x) = f ∞ (x) +
dy K̄ (x − y) f (y) ,
−∞

(17.26)

X

where K̄ is the kernel of the integral operator K̄ introduced in equation (17.24) and f ∞
is the solution of (17.21) for X = ∞. In many cases an explicit expression for f ∞ can be
derived by Fourier transformation. Using that f (x) = f (−x) and shifting the variables in

17.2 The Wiener-Hopf method

(17.26) by introducing g(z) = f (X + z) we obtain
 ∞
g(z) = f ∞ (X + z) +
dz  K̄ (z − z  ) f (z  )
0
 ∞
dz  K̄ (2X + z + z  ) f (z  ).
+

(17.27)

0

Assuming that the kernel K̄ (x) vanishes sufﬁciently fast with x > 0, we may solve the
integral equation (17.27) by a rapidly converging expansion [495]
g(z) =

∞


gn (x) .

(17.28)

n=0

The functions gn (z) fulﬁl linear integral equations of the form
 ∞
(0)
gn (z) = gn (z) +
dz  K̄ (z − z  )gn (z  ) ,

(17.29)

0

where
g0(0) (z) = f ∞ (X + z) ,
 ∞
gn(0) (z) =
dz  K̄ (2X + z + z  )gn−1 (z  ) ,

n ≥ 1.

(17.30)

0

The resulting equations for the functions gn (x) are of Wiener-Hopf type and can be solved
as follows (see e.g. [329]). We start by Fourier-transforming (17.29)
(1 − K̄ (ω))gn+ (ω) + gn− (ω) = gn(0) (ω) ,
where
gn± (ω) =

(17.31)


dz θ H (±z)gn (z) exp(iωz)

(17.32)

provide a decomposition of gn (ω) into a sum of two parts that are analytic in the upper
and lower half planes, respectively (θ H (z) is the Heaviside step function). The key to the
solution of the Wiener-Hopf equation (17.31) is to decompose the kernel into factors G ±
that are analytic in the upper and lower complex ω-plane, respectively
1 − K̄ (ω) = [G + (ω)G − (ω)]−1 ,

lim G ± (ω) = 1

(17.33)

−
[G + (ω)]−1 gn+ (ω) + G − (ω)gn− (ω) = Q +
n (ω) + Q n (ω)

(17.34)

ω→∞

Using such a factorization equation (17.31) becomes

where Q ±
n (ω) are analytic in the upper and lower half planes respectively:
−
−
(0)
Q+
n (ω) + Q n (ω) = G (ω)gn (ω).

(17.35)

Using the analytic properties of the functions involved we obtain the solution of

equation (17.34)
gn+ (ω) = G + (ω)Q +
n (ω) ,
Q−
n (ω)
.
gn− (ω) = −
G (ω)

(17.36)

For practical applications the following identities are useful
 ∞
dz gn (z) = gn+ (ω = 0), gn (z = 0) = −i lim ωgn+ (ω) .
