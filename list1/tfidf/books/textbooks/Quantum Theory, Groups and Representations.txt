Preface

This book began as course notes prepared for a class taught at Columbia
University during the 2012–13 academic year. The intent was to cover the
basics of quantum mechanics, up to and including relativistic quantum field
theory of free fields, from a point of view emphasizing the role of unitary
representations of Lie groups in the foundations of the subject. It has been
significantly rewritten and extended since that time, partially based upon
experience teaching the same material during 2014–15.
The approach to this material is simultaneously rather advanced, using
crucially some fundamental mathematical structures discussed, if at all, only
in graduate mathematics courses, while at the same time trying to do this in
as elementary terms as possible. The Lie groups needed are (with one crucial
exception) ones that can be described simply in terms of matrices. Much
of the representation theory will also just use standard manipulations of
matrices. The only prerequisite for the course as taught was linear algebra
and multivariable calculus (while a full appreciation of the topics covered
would benefit from quite a bit more than this). My hope is that this level of
presentation will simultaneously be useful to mathematics students trying to
learn something about both quantum mechanics and Lie groups and their
representations, as well as to physics students who already have seen some
quantum mechanics, but would like to know more about the mathematics
underlying the subject, especially that relevant to exploiting symmetry
principles.
The topics covered emphasize the mathematical structure of the subject
and often intentionally avoid overlap with the material of standard physics
courses in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, for which many
excellent textbooks are available. This document is best read in conjunction
with such a text. In particular, some experience with the details of the physics
not covered here is needed to truly appreciate the subject. Some of the main
differences with standard physics presentations include the following:

Preface

• The role of Lie groups, Lie algebras, and their unitary representations is
systematically emphasized, including not just the standard use of these
to derive consequences for the theory of a “symmetry” generated by
operators commuting with the Hamiltonian.
• Symplectic geometry and the role of the Lie algebra of functions on
phase space in the classical theory of Hamiltonian mechanics are
emphasized. “Quantization” is then the passage to a unitary representation (unique by the Stone–von Neumann theorem) of a subalgebra of
this Lie algebra.
• The role of the metaplectic representation and the subtleties of the
projective factor involved are described in detail. This includes phenomena depending on the choice of a complex structure, a topic known
to physicists as “Bogoliubov transformations.”
• The closely parallel story of the Clifford algebra and spinor representation is extensively investigated. These are related to the Heisenberg
Lie algebra and the metaplectic representation by interchanging commutative (“bosonic”) and anticommutative (“fermionic”) generators,
introducing the notion of a “Lie superalgebra” generalizing that of a Lie
algebra.
• Many topics usually first encountered in physics texts in the context of
relativistic quantum field theory are instead first developed in simpler
non-relativistic or finite dimensional contexts. Non-relativistic quantum field theory based on the Schrödinger equation is described in
detail before moving on to the relativistic case. The topic of irreducible
representations of space–time symmetry groups is first addressed with
the case of the Euclidean group, where the implications for the
non-relativistic theory are explained. The analogous problem for the
relativistic case, that of the irreducible representations of the Poincaré
group, is then worked out later on.
• The emphasis is on the Hamiltonian formalism and its
representation-theoretical implications, with the Lagrangian formalism
(the basis of most quantum field theory textbooks) de-emphasized. In
particular, the operators generating symmetry transformations are
derived using the moment map for the action of such transformations
on phase space, not by invoking Noether’s theorem for transformations
that leave invariant a Lagrangian.
• Care is taken to keep track of the distinction between vector spaces and
their duals. It is the dual of phase space (linear coordinates on phase
space) that appears in the Heisenberg Lie algebra, with quantization a
representation of this Lie algebra by linear operators.

Preface

• The distinction between real and complex vector spaces, along with the
role of complexification and choice of a complex structure, is systematically emphasized. A choice of complex structure plays a crucial part
in quantization using annihilation and creation operator methods,
especially in relativistic quantum field theory, where a different sort of
choice than in the non-relativistic case is responsible for the existence of
antiparticles.
Some differences with other mathematics treatments of this material are as
follows:
• A fully rigorous treatment of the subject is not attempted. At the same
time, an effort is made to indicate where significant issues arise should
one pursue such a treatment, and to provide references to rigorous
discussions of these issues. An attempt is also made to make clear the
difference between where a rigorous treatment could be pursued relatively straightforwardly and where there are serious problems of principle making a rigorous treatment hard to achieve.
• The discussion of Lie groups and their representations is focused on
specific examples, not the general theory. For compact Lie groups,
emphasis is on the groups Uð1Þ; SOð3Þ; SUð2Þ and their finite dimensional representations. Central to the basic structure of quantum
mechanics are the Heisenberg group, the symplectic groups Spð2n; R)
and the metaplectic representation, as well as the spinor groups and the
spin representation. The geometry of space–time leads to the study of
Euclidean groups in two and three dimensions, and the Lorentz (SO
(3,1)) and Poincaré groups, together with their representations. These
examples of non-compact Lie groups are a fundamental feature of
quantum mechanics, but not a conventional topic in the mathematics
curriculum.
• A central example studied thoroughly and in some generality is that
of the metaplectic representation of the double cover of Spð2n; R) (in
the commutative case), or spin representation of the double cover of
SOð2n; R) (anticommutative case). This specific example of a representation provides the foundation of quantum theory, with quantum
field theory involving a generalization to the case of n infinite.
• No attempt is made to pursue a general notion of quantization, despite
the great mathematical interest of such generalizations. In particular,
attention is restricted to the case of linear symplectic manifolds. The
linear structure plays a crucial role, with quantization given by a representation of a Heisenberg algebra in the commutative case and a
Clifford algebra in the anticommutative case. The very explicit methods
used (staying close to the physics formalism) mostly do not apply to

viii

Preface

more general conceptions of quantization (e.g., geometric quantization)
of mathematical interest for their applications in representation theory.
The scope of material covered in later sections of the book is governed by a
desire to give some explanation of what the central mathematical objects are
that occur in the Standard Model of particle physics, while staying within the
bounds of a one-year course. The Standard Model embodies our best current
understanding of the fundamental nature of reality, making a better understanding of its mathematical nature a central problem for anyone who
believes that mathematics and physics are intimately connected at their
deepest levels. The author hopes that the treatment of this subject here will
be helpful to anyone interested in pursuing a better understanding of this
connection.

0.1 Acknowledgements
The students of Mathematics W4391-2 at Columbia during 2012–13 and
2014–15 deserve much of the credit for the existence of this book and for
whatever virtues it might have. Their patience with and the interest they
took in what I was trying to do were a great encouragement, and the many
questions they asked were often very helpful. The reader should be aware that
the book they have in their hands, whatever its faults, is a huge improvement
over what these students had to put up with.
The quality of the manuscript was dramatically improved over that of
early versions through the extreme diligence of Michel Talagrand, who early
on took an interest in what I was doing, and over a long period of time
carefully read over many versions. His combination of encouragement and
extensive detailed criticism was invaluable. He will at some point be publishing his own take on many of the same topics covered here ([91]), which I
can’t recommend enough.
At some point I started keeping a list of those who provided specific
suggestions, it includes Kimberly Clinch, Art Brown, Jason Ezra Williams,
Mateusz Wasilewski, Gordon Watson, Cecilia Jarlskog, Alex Purins, James
Van Meter, Thomas Tallant, Todor Popov, Stephane T’Jampens, Cris
Moore, Noah Miller, Ben Israeli, Nigel Green, Charles Waldman, Peter
Grieve, Kevin McCann, Chris Weed, Fernando Chamizo, and various
anonymous commenters on my blog. My apologies to others who I’m sure
that I’ve forgotten.
The illustrations were done in TikZ by Ben Dribus, who was a great
pleasure to work with.
Much early enthusiasm and encouragement for this project was provided
by Eugene Ha at Springer. Marc Strauss and Loretta Bartolini have been the
ones there who have helped to finally bring this to a conclusion.

Thanks also to all my colleagues in the mathematics department at
Columbia, who have over the years provided a very supportive environment
for me to work in and learn more every day about mathematics.
Finally, I’m grateful for the daily encouragement and unfailing support
over the years from my partner Pamela Cruz that has been invaluable for
surviving getting to the end of this project and will make possible whatever
the next one might be.

Introduction and Overview

1.1 Introduction
A famous quote from Richard Feynman goes “I think it is safe to say that
no one understands quantum mechanics.” [22]. In this book, we will pursue
one possible route to such an understanding, emphasizing the deep connections of quantum mechanics to fundamental ideas of modern mathematics.
The strangeness inherent in quantum theory that Feynman was referring
to has two rather diﬀerent sources. One of them is the striking disjunction
and incommensurability between the conceptual framework of the classical
physics which governs our everyday experience of the physical world, and the
very diﬀerent framework which governs physical reality at the atomic scale.
Familiarity with the powerful formalisms of classical mechanics and electromagnetism provides deep understanding of the world at the distance scales
familiar to us. Supplementing these with the more modern (but still “classical” in the sense of “not quantum”) subjects of special and general relativity
extends our understanding into other much less familiar regimes, while still
leaving atomic physics a mystery.
Read in context though, Feynman was pointing to a second source of difﬁculty, contrasting the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics with
that of the theory of general relativity, a supposedly equally hard to understand subject. General relativity can be a diﬃcult subject to master, but its
mathematical and conceptual structure involves a fairly straightforward extension of structures that characterize nineteenth-century physics. The fundamental physical laws (Einstein’s equations for general relativity) are expressed as partial diﬀerential equations, a familiar if diﬃcult mathematical
subject. The state of a system is determined by a set of ﬁelds satisfying these
equations, and observable quantities are functionals of these ﬁelds. The mathematics is largely that of the usual calculus: diﬀerential equations and their
real-valued solutions.

1 Introduction and Overview

In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is best thought of as a different sort of mathematical object: a vector in a complex vector space with
a Hermitian inner product, the so-called “state space”. Such a state space
will sometimes be a space of functions known as wavefunctions. While these
may, like classical ﬁelds, satisfy a diﬀerential equation, one non-classical feature is that wavefunctions are complex-valued. What’s completely diﬀerent
about quantum mechanics is the treatment of observable quantities, which
correspond to self-adjoint linear operators on the state space. When such operators do not commute, our intuitions about how physics should work are
violated, as we can no longer simultaneously assign numerical values to the
observables.
During the earliest days of quantum mechanics, the mathematician
Hermann Weyl quickly recognized that the mathematical structures being
used were ones he was quite familiar with from his work in the ﬁeld of representation theory. From the point of view that takes representation theory
as a central theme in mathematics, the framework of quantum mechanics
looks perfectly natural. Weyl soon wrote a book expounding such ideas [100],
but this got a mixed reaction from physicists unhappy with the penetration
of unfamiliar mathematical structures into their subject (with some of them
characterizing the situation as the “Gruppenpest,” the group theory plague).
One goal of this book will be to try and make some of this mathematics as
accessible as possible, boiling down part of Weyl’s exposition to its essentials while updating it in light of many decades of progress toward better
understanding of the subject.
Weyl’s insight that quantization of a classical system crucially involves
understanding the Lie groups that act on the classical phase space and the
unitary representations of these groups has been vindicated by later developments which dramatically expanded the scope of these ideas. The use of
representation theory to exploit the symmetries of a problem has become a
powerful tool that has found uses in many areas of science, not just quantum
mechanics. I hope that readers whose main interest is physics will learn to
appreciate some of such mathematical structures that lie behind the calculations of standard textbooks, helping them understand how to eﬀectively
exploit them in other contexts. Those whose main interest is mathematics
will hopefully gain some understanding of fundamental physics, at the same
time as seeing some crucial examples of groups and representations. These
should provide a good grounding for appreciating more abstract presentations of the subject that are part of the standard mathematical curriculum.
Anyone curious about the relation of fundamental physics to mathematics
and what Eugene Wigner described as “The Unreasonable Eﬀectiveness of
Mathematics in the Natural Sciences” [101] should beneﬁt from an exposure
to this remarkable story at the intersection of the two subjects.
The following sections give an overview of the fundamental ideas behind
much of the material to follow. In this sketchy and abstract form, they will

1.1

likely seem rather mystifying to those meeting them for the ﬁrst time. As we
work through basic examples in the coming chapters, a better understanding
of the overall picture described here should start to emerge.

1.2 Basic principles of quantum mechanics
We will divide the conventional list of basic principles of quantum mechanics into two parts, with the ﬁrst covering the fundamental mathematics
structures.

1.2.1 Fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics
In classical physics, the state of a system is given by a point in a “phase
space,” which can be thought of equivalently as the space of solutions of an
equation of motion, or as (parametrizing solutions by initial value data) the
space of coordinates and momenta. Observable quantities are just functions
on this space (e.g., functions of the coordinates and momenta). There is one
distinguished observable, the energy or Hamiltonian, and it determines how
states evolve in time through Hamilton’s equations.
The basic structure of quantum mechanics is quite diﬀerent, with the formalism built on the following simple axioms:
Axiom (States). The state of a quantum mechanical system is given by a
nonzero vector in a complex vector space H with Hermitian inner product
·, ·.
We will review in chapter 4 some linear algebra, including the properties of
inner products on complex vector spaces. H may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimensional, with further restrictions required in the inﬁnite dimensional case (e.g.,
we may want to require H to be a Hilbert space). Note two very important
diﬀerences with classical mechanical states:
• The state space is always linear: A linear combination of states is also a
state.
• The state space is a complex vector space: these linear combinations can
and do crucially involve complex numbers, in an inescapable way. In the
classical case, only real numbers appear, with complex numbers used
only as an inessential calculational tool.
We will sometimes use the notation introduced by Dirac for vectors in the
state space H: Such a vector with a label ψ is denoted

4

1 Introduction and Overview

|ψ
Axiom (Observables). The observables of a quantum mechanical system are
given by self-adjoint linear operators on H.
We will review the deﬁnition of self-adjointness for H ﬁnite dimensional
in chapter 4. For H inﬁnite dimensional, the deﬁnition becomes much more
subtle, and we will not enter into the analysis needed.
Axiom (Dynamics). There is a distinguished observable, the Hamiltonian
H. Time evolution of states |ψ(t) ∈ H is given by the Schrödinger equation
i

d
|ψ(t) = H|ψ(t)
dt

(1.1)

The operator H has eigenvalues that are bounded below.
The Hamiltonian observable H will have a physical interpretation in terms
of energy, with the boundedness condition necessary in order to assure the
existence of a stable lowest energy state.
 is a dimensional constant, called Planck’s constant, the value of which
depends on what units one uses for time and for energy. It has the dimensions
[energy] · [time], and its experimental values are
1.054571726(47) × 10−34 Joule · seconds = 6.58211928(15) × 10−16 eV · seconds
(eV is the unit of “electron-Volt,” the energy acquired by an electron moving
through a one-Volt electric potential). The most natural units to use for
quantum mechanical problems would be energy and time units chosen so that
 = 1. For instance, one could use seconds for time and measure energies in
the very small units of 6.6×10−16 eV, or use eV for energies, and then the very
small units of 6.6 × 10−16 seconds for time. Schrödinger’s equation implies
that if one is looking at a system where the typical energy scale is an eV,
one’s state vector will be changing on the very short time scale of 6.6 × 10−16
seconds. When we do computations, usually we will set  = 1, implicitly
going to a unit system natural for quantum mechanics. After calculating a
ﬁnal result, appropriate factors of  can be inserted to get answers in more
conventional unit systems.
It is sometimes convenient, however, to carry along factors of , since this
can help make clear which terms correspond to classical physics behavior,
and which ones are purely quantum mechanical in nature. Typically, classical
physics comes about in the limit where
(energy scale)(time scale)

is large. This is true for the energy and time scales encountered in everyday
life, but it can also always be achieved by taking  → 0, and this is what will
often be referred to as the “classical limit.” One should keep in mind though
that the manner in which classical behavior emerges out of quantum theory
in such a limit can be a very complicated phenomenon.

1.2.2 Principles of measurement theory
The above axioms characterize the mathematical structure of a quantum
theory, but they do not address the “measurement problem.” This is the
question of how to apply this structure to a physical system interacting with
some sort of macroscopic, human-scale experimental apparatus that “measures” what is going on. This is a highly thorny issue, requiring in principle
the study of two interacting quantum systems (the one being measured and
the measurement apparatus) in an overall state that is not just the product
of the two states, but is highly “entangled” (for the meaning of this term, see
chapter 9). Since a macroscopic apparatus will involve something like 1023
degrees of freedom, this question is extremely hard to analyze purely within
the quantum mechanical framework (requiring for instance the solution of a
Schrödinger equation in 1023 variables).
Instead of trying to resolve in general this problem of how macroscopic
classical physics behavior emerges in a measurement process, one can adopt
the following two principles as providing a phenomenological description of
what will happen, and these allow one to make precise statistical predictions
using quantum theory:
Principle (Observables). States for which the value of an observable can be
characterized by a well-deﬁned number are the states that are eigenvectors for
the corresponding self-adjoint operator. The value of the observable in such a
state will be a real number, the eigenvalue of the operator.
This principle identiﬁes the states we have some hope of sensibly associating a label to (the eigenvalue), a label which in some contexts corresponds
to an observable quantity characterizing states in classical mechanics. The
observables with important physical signiﬁcance (for instance, the energy,
momentum, angular momentum, or charge) will turn out to correspond to
some group action on the physical system.
Principle (The Born rule). Given an observable O and two unit-norm states
|ψ1  and |ψ2  that are eigenvectors of O with distinct eigenvalues λ1 and λ2
O|ψ1  = λ1 |ψ1 , O|ψ2  = λ2 |ψ2 

6

1 Introduction and Overview

the complex linear combination state
c1 |ψ1  + c2 |ψ2 
will not have a well-deﬁned value for the observable O. If one attempts to
measure this observable, one will get either λ1 or λ2 , with probabilities
|c21 |
2
|c1 | + |c22 |
and

|c22 |
|c21 | + |c22 |

respectively.
The Born rule is sometimes raised to the level of an axiom of the theory, but
it is plausible to expect that, given a full understanding of how measurements
work, it can be derived from the more fundamental axioms of the previous
section. Such an understanding though of how classical behavior emerges in
experiments is a very challenging topic, with the notion of “decoherence”
playing an important role. See the end of this chapter for some references
that discuss these issues in detail.
Note that the state c|ψ will have the same eigenvalues and probabilities
as the state |ψ, for any complex number c. It is conventional to work with
states of norm ﬁxed to the value 1, which ﬁxes the amplitude of c, leaving
a remaining ambiguity which is a phase eiθ . By the above principles, this
phase will not contribute to the calculated probabilities of measurements.
We will, however, not take the point of view that this phase information can
just be ignored. It plays an important role in the mathematical structure, and
the relative phase of two diﬀerent states certainly does aﬀect measurement
probabilities.

1.3 Unitary group representations
The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is closely related to what
mathematicians describe as the theory of “unitary group representations.”
We will be examining this notion in great detail and working through many
examples in the coming chapters, but here is a quick summary of the general
theory.

1.3

Unitary group representations

7

1.3.1 Lie groups
A fundamental notion that appears throughout diﬀerent ﬁelds of mathematics
is that of a group:
Definition (Group). A group G is a set with an associative multiplication,
such that the set contains an identity element, as well as the multiplicative
inverse of each element.
If the set has a ﬁnite number of elements, this is called a “ﬁnite group.”
The theory of these and their use in quantum mechanics is a well-developed
subject, but one we mostly will bypass in favor of the study of “Lie groups,”
which have an inﬁnite number of elements. The elements of a Lie group make
up a geometrical space of some dimension, and choosing local coordinates on
the space, the group operations are given by diﬀerentiable functions. Most of
the Lie groups we will consider are “matrix groups,” meaning subgroups of
the group of n by n invertible matrices (with real or complex matrix entries).
The group multiplication in this case is matrix multiplication. An example
we will consider in great detail is the group of all rotations about a point
in three-dimensional space, in which case such rotations can be identiﬁed
with 3 by 3 matrices, with composition of rotations corresponding to the
multiplication of matrices.
Digression. A standard deﬁnition of a Lie group is as a smooth manifold,
with group laws given by smooth (inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable) maps. More generally, one might consider topological manifolds and continuous maps, but this
gives nothing new (by the solution to Hilbert’s Fifth problem). Most of the
ﬁnite dimensional Lie groups of interest are matrix Lie groups, which can be
deﬁned as closed subgroups of the group of invertible matrices of some ﬁxed
dimension. One particular group of importance in quantum mechanics (the
metaplectic group, see chapter 20) is not a matrix group, so the more general
deﬁnition is needed to include this case.

1.3.2 Group representations
Groups often occur as “transformation groups,” meaning groups of elements
acting as transformations of some particular geometric object. In the example
mentioned above of the group of three-dimensional rotations, such rotations
are linear transformations of R3 . In general:
Definition (Group action on a set). An action of a group G on a set M is
given by a map
(g, x) ∈ G × M → g · x ∈ M

8

1 Introduction and Overview

that takes a pair (g, x) of a group element g ∈ G and an element x ∈ M to
another element g · x ∈ M such that
g1 · (g2 · x) = (g1 g2 ) · x

(1.2)

and
e·x=x
where e is the identity element of G
A good example to keep in mind is that of three-dimensional space M =
R3 with the standard inner product. This comes with two diﬀerent group
actions preserving the inner product
• An action of the group G1 = R3 on R3 by translations.
• An action of the group G2 = O(3) of three-dimensional orthogonal transformations of R3 . These are the rotations about the origin (possibly
combined with a reﬂection). Note that in this case order matters: For
non-commutative groups like O(3), one has g1 g2 = g2 g1 for some group
elements g1 , g2 .
A fundamental principle of modern mathematics is that the way to understand a space M , given as some set of points, is to look at F (M ), the
set of functions on this space. This “linearizes” the problem, since the function space is a vector space, no matter what the geometrical structure of
the original set is. If the set has a ﬁnite number of elements, the function
space will be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space. In general, though, it will be
inﬁnite dimensional and one will need to further specify the space of functions (e.g., continuous functions, diﬀerentiable functions, functions with ﬁnite
norm) under consideration.
Given a group action of G on M , functions on M come with an action of
G by linear transformations, given by
(g · f )(x) = f (g −1 · x)

(1.3)

where f is some function on M .
The order in which elements of the group act may matter, so the inverse
is needed to get the group action property 1.2, since
g1 · (g2 · f )(x) = g2 · f (g1−1 · x)
= f (g2−1 · (g1−1 · x))
= f ((g2−1 g1−1 ) · x)
= f ((g1 g2 )−1 · x)
= (g1 g2 ) · f (x)

1.3

Unitary group representations

9

This calculation would not work out properly for non-commutative G if one
deﬁned (g · f )(x) = f (g · x).
One can abstract from this situation and deﬁne as follows a representation
as an action of a group by linear transformations on a vector space:
Definition (Representation). A representation (π, V ) of a group G is a homomorphism
π : g ∈ G → π(g) ∈ GL(V )
where GL(V ) is the group of invertible linear maps V → V , with V a vector
space.
Saying the map π is a homomorphism means
π(g1 )π(g2 ) = π(g1 g2 )
for all g1 , g2 ∈ G, i.e., it satisﬁes the property needed to get a group action.
We will mostly be interested in the case of complex representations, where
V is a complex vector space, so one should assume from now on that a
representation is complex unless otherwise speciﬁed (there will be cases where
the representations are real).
When V is ﬁnite dimensional and a basis of V has been chosen, then
linear maps and matrices can be identiﬁed (see the review of linear algebra
in chapter 4). Such an identiﬁcation provides an isomorphism
GL(V )  GL(n, C)
of the group of invertible linear maps of V with GL(n, C), the group of invertible n by n complex matrices. We will begin by studying representations
that are ﬁnite dimensional and will try to make rigorous statements. Later
on, we will get to representations on function spaces, which are inﬁnite dimensional, and will then often neglect rigor and analytical diﬃculties. Note
that only in the case of M a ﬁnite set of points will we get an action by ﬁnite
dimensional matrices this way, since then F (M ) will be a ﬁnite dimensional
vector space (C# of points in M ).
A good example to consider to understand this construction in the ﬁnite
dimensional case is the following:
• Take M to be a set of 3 elements x1 , x2 , x3 . So F (M ) = C3 . For f ∈
F (M ), f is a vector in C3 , with components (f (x1 ), f (x2 ), f (x3 )).
• Take G = S3 , the group of permutations of 3 elements. This group has
3! = 6 elements.
• Take G to act on M by permuting the 3 elements
(g, xj ) → g · xj

10

1 Introduction and Overview

• This group action provides a representation of G on F (M ) by the linear
maps
(π(g)f )(xj ) = f (g −1 · xj )
Taking the standard basis of F (M ) = C3 , the j’th basis element will correspond to the function f that takes value 1 on xj and 0 on the other two
elements. With respect to this basis, the π(g) give six 3 by 3 complex matrices, which under multiplication of matrices satisfy the same relations as the
elements of the group under group multiplication. In this particular case, all
the entries of the matrix will be 0 or 1, but that is special to the permutation
representation.
A common source of confusion is that representations (π, V ) are sometimes
referred to by the map π, leaving implicit the vector space V that the matrices
π(g) act on, but at other times referred to by specifying the vector space V ,
leaving implicit the map π. One reason for this is that the map π may be the
identity map: Often, G is a matrix group, so a subgroup of GL(n, C), acting
on V  Cn by the standard action of matrices on vectors. One should keep
in mind though that just specifying V is generally not enough to specify the
representation, since it may not be the standard one. For example, it could
very well be the trivial representation on V , where
π(g) = 1n
i.e., each element of G acts on V as the identity.

1.3.3 Unitary group representations
The most interesting classes of complex representations are often those for
which the linear transformations π(g) are “unitary,” preserving the notion of
length given by the standard Hermitian inner product and thus taking unit
vectors to unit vectors. We have the deﬁnition:
Definition (Unitary representation). A representation (π, V ) on a complex
vector space V with Hermitian inner product ·, · is a unitary representation
if it preserves the inner product, i.e.,
π(g)v1 , π(g)v2  = v1 , v2 
for all g ∈ G and v1 , v2 ∈ V .
For a unitary representation, the matrices π(g) take values in a subgroup
U (n) ⊂ GL(n, C). In our review of linear algebra (chapter 4), we will see
that U (n) can be characterized as the group of n by n complex matrices U
such that

1.3

Unitary group representations

11

U −1 = U †
where U † is the conjugate-transpose of U . Note that we will be using the
notation “† ” to mean the “adjoint” or conjugate-transpose matrix. This notation is pretty universal in physics, whereas mathematicians prefer to use
“∗ ” instead of “† .”

1.4 Representations and quantum
mechanics
The fundamental relationship between quantum mechanics and representation theory is that whenever we have a physical quantum system with a group
G acting on it, the space of states H will carry a unitary representation of G
(at least up to a phase factor ambiguity). For physicists working with quantum mechanics, this implies that representation theory provides information
about quantum mechanical state spaces when G acts on the system. For
mathematicians studying representation theory, this means that physics is a
very fruitful source of unitary representations to study: any physical system
with a group G acting on it will provide one.
For a representation π and group elements g that are close to the identity,
exponentiation can be used to write π(g) ∈ GL(n, C) as
π(g) = eA
where A is also a matrix, close to the zero matrix. We will study this situation in much more detail and work extensively with examples, showing in
particular that if π(g) is unitary (i.e., in the subgroup U (n) ⊂ GL(n, C)),
then A will be skew-adjoint:
A† = −A
where A† is the conjugate-transpose matrix. Deﬁning B = iA, we ﬁnd that
B is self-adjoint
B† = B
We thus see that, at least in the case of ﬁnite dimensional H, the unitary
representation π of G on H coming from an action of G of our physical system
gives us not just unitary matrices π(g), but also corresponding self-adjoint
operators B on H. Lie group actions thus provide us with a class of quantum
mechanical observables, with the self-adjointness property of these operators
corresponding to the unitarity of the representation on state space. It is a
remarkable fact that for many physical systems, the class of observables that
arise in this way include the ones of most physical interest.

12

1 Introduction and Overview

In the following chapters, we will see many examples of this phenomenon.
A fundamental example that we will study in detail is that of action by
translation in time. Here, the group is G = R (with the additive group law)
and we get a unitary representation of R on the space of states H. The
corresponding self-adjoint operator is the Hamiltonian operator H (divided
by ), and the representation is given by
i

t ∈ R → π(t) = e−  Ht
which one can check is a group homomorphism from the additive group R to
a group of unitary operators. This unitary representation gives the dynamics
of the theory, with the Schrödinger equation 1.1 just the statement that
− i HΔt is the skew-adjoint operator that gets exponentiated to give the
unitary transformation that moves states ψ(t) ahead in time by an amount
Δt.
One way to construct quantum mechanical state spaces H is as “wavefunctions,” meaning complex-valued functions on space–time. Given any group
action on space–time, we get a representation π on the state space H of such
wavefunctions by the construction of equation 1.3. Many of the representations of interest will, however, not come from this construction, and we will
begin our study of the subject in the next few chapters with such examples,
which are simpler because they are ﬁnite dimensional. In later chapters, we
will turn to representations induced from group actions on space–time, which
will be inﬁnite dimensional.

1.5 Groups and symmetries
The subject we are considering is often described as the study of “symmetry groups,” since the groups may occur as groups of elements acting by
transformations of a space M preserving some particular structure (thus, a
“symmetry transformation”). We would like to emphasize though that it is
not necessary that the transformations under consideration preserve any particular structure. In the applications to physics, the term “symmetry” is best
restricted to the case of groups acting on a physical system in a way that
preserves the equations of motion (e.g., by leaving the Hamiltonian function
unchanged in the case of a classical mechanical system). For the case of groups
of such symmetry transformations, the use of the representation theory of the
group to derive implications for the behavior of a quantum mechanical system
is an important application of the theory. We will see, however, that the role
of representation theory in quantum mechanics is quite a bit deeper than
this, with the overall structure of the theory determined by group actions
that are not symmetries (in the sense of not preserving the Hamiltonian).

1.6 For further reading
We will be approaching the subject of quantum theory from a diﬀerent direction than the conventional one, starting with the role of symmetry and
with the simplest possible ﬁnite dimensional quantum systems, systems which
are purely quantum mechanical, with no classical analog. This means that
the early discussion found in most physics textbooks is rather diﬀerent from
the one here. They will generally include the same fundamental principles
described here, but often begin with the theory of motion of a quantized particle, trying to motivate it from classical mechanics. The state space is then
a space of wavefunctions, which is inﬁnite dimensional and necessarily brings
some analytical diﬃculties.
Quantum mechanics is inherently a quite diﬀerent conceptual structure
than classical mechanics. The relationship between the two subjects is rather
complicated, but it is clear that quantum mechanics cannot be derived from
classical mechanics, so attempts to motivate it that way are unconvincing,
although they correspond to the very interesting historical story of how the
subject evolved. We will come to the topic of the quantized motion of a
particle only in chapter 10, at which point it should become much easier to
follow the standard books.
There are many good physics quantum mechanics textbooks available,
aimed at a wide variety of backgrounds, and a reader of this book should
look for one at an appropriate level to supplement the discussions here. One
example would be [81], which is not really an introductory text, but it includes
the physicist’s version of many of the standard calculations we will also be
considering. Some useful textbooks on the subject aimed at mathematicians
are [20], [41], [43], [57], and [90]. The ﬁrst few chapters of [28] provide an
excellent while very concise summary of both basic physics and quantum
mechanics. One important topic we will not discuss is that of the application
of the representation theory of ﬁnite groups in quantum mechanics. For this
as well as a discussion that overlaps quite a bit with the point of view of this
book while emphasizing diﬀerent topics, see [84]. For another textbook at the
level of this one emphasizing the physicist’s point of view, see [106].
For the diﬃcult issue of how measurements work and how classical physics
emerges from quantum theory, an important part of the story is the notion of
“decoherence.” Good places to read about this are Wojciech Zurek’s updated
version of his 1991 Physics Today article [110], as well as his more recent work
on “quantum Darwinism” [111]. There is an excellent book on the subject by
Schlosshauer [75], and for the details of what happens in real experimental
setups, see the book by Haroche and Raimond [44]. For a review of how classical physics emerges from quantum physics written from the mathematical
point of view, see Landsman [54]. Finally, to get an idea of the wide variety
of points of view available on the topic of the “interpretation” of quantum
mechanics, there is a volume of interviews [76] with experts on the topic.

14

1 Introduction and Overview

The topic of Lie groups and their representation theory is a standard part
of the mathematical curriculum at a more advanced level. As we work through
examples in later chapters, we will give references to textbooks covering this
material.

Chapter 2

The Group U (1) and its
Representations

The simplest example of a Lie group is the group of rotations of the plane,
with elements parametrized by a single number, the angle of rotation θ. It is
useful to identify such group elements with unit vectors eiθ in the complex
plane. The group is then denoted U (1), since such complex numbers can
be thought of as 1 by 1 unitary matrices. We will see in this chapter how
the general picture described in chapter 1 works out in this simple case.
State spaces will be unitary representations of the group U (1), and we will
see that any such representation decomposes into a sum of one-dimensional
representations. These one-dimensional representations will be characterized
by an integer q, and such integers are the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator
we will call Q, which is an observable of the quantum theory.
One motivation for the notation Q is that this is the conventional physics
notation for electric charge, and this is one of the places where a U (1)
group occurs in physics. Examples of U (1) groups acting on physical systems include:
• Quantum particles can be described by a complex-valued “wavefunction” (see chapter 10), and U (1) acts on such wavefunctions by pointwise phase transformations of the value of the function. This phenomenon can be used to understand how particles interact with electromagnetic ﬁelds, and in this case, the physical interpretation of the eigenvalue
of the Q operator will be the electric charge of the state. We will discuss
this in detail in chapter 45.
• If one chooses a particular direction in three-dimensional space, then the
group of rotations about that axis can be identiﬁed with the group U (1).
The eigenvalues of Q will have a physical interpretation as the quantum
version of angular momentum in the chosen direction. The fact that
such eigenvalues are not continuous, but integral, shows that quantum
angular momentum has quite diﬀerent behavior than classical angular
momentum.

2 The Group U (1) and its Representations

• When we study the harmonic oscillator (chapter 22), we will ﬁnd that it
has a U (1) symmetry (rotations in the position-momentum plane) and
that the Hamiltonian operator is a multiple of the operator Q for this
case. This implies that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (which give
the energy of the system) will be integers times some ﬁxed value. When
one describes multiparticle systems in terms of quantum ﬁelds, one ﬁnds
a harmonic oscillator for each momentum mode, and then the Q for that
mode counts the number of particles with that momentum.
We will sometimes refer to the operator Q as a “charge” operator, assigning
a much more general meaning to the term than that of the speciﬁc example
of electric charge. U (1) representations are also ubiquitous in mathematics,
where often the integral eigenvalues of the Q operator will be called “weights.”
In a very real sense, the reason for the “quantum” in “quantum mechanics”
is precisely because of the role of U (1) groups acting on the state space. Such
an action implies observables that characterize states by an integer eigenvalue
of an operator Q, and it is this “quantization” of observables that motivates
the name of the subject.

2.1 Some representation theory
Recall the deﬁnition of a group representation:
Definition (Representation). A (complex) representation (π, V ) of a group
G on a complex vector space V (with a chosen basis identifying V  Cn ) is
a homomorphism
π : G → GL(n, C)
This is just a set of n by n matrices, one for each group element, satisfying
the multiplication rules of the group elements. n is called the dimension of
the representation.
We are mainly interested in the case of G a Lie group, where G is a diﬀerentiable manifold of some dimension. In such a case, we will restrict attention
to representations given by diﬀerentiable maps π. As a space, GL(n, C) is the
2
space Cn of all n by n complex matrices, with the locus of non-invertible
(zero determinant) elements removed. Choosing local coordinates on G, π
will be given by 2n2 real functions on G, and the condition that G is a differentiable manifold means that the derivative of π is consistently deﬁned.
Our focus will be not on the general case, but on the study of certain speciﬁc
Lie groups and representations π which are of central interest in quantum
mechanics. For these representations, one will be able to readily see that the
maps π are diﬀerentiable.

2.1

Some representation theory

17

To understand the representations of a group G, one proceeds by ﬁrst
identifying the irreducible ones:
Definition (Irreducible representation). A representation π is called irreducible if it is has no subrepresentations, meaning nonzero proper subspaces
W ⊂ V such that (π|W , W ) is a representation. A representation that does
have such a subrepresentation is called reducible.
Given two representations, their direct sum is deﬁned as:
Definition (Direct sum representation). Given representations π1 and π2
of dimensions n1 and n2 , there is a representation of dimension n1 + n2
called the direct sum of the two representations, denoted by π1 ⊕ π2 . This
representation is given by the homomorphism

(π1 ⊕ π2 ) : g ∈ G →


π1 (g) 0
0 π2 (g)

In other words, representation matrices for the direct sum are block-diagonal
matrices with π1 and π2 giving the blocks. For unitary representations
Theorem 2.1. Any unitary representation π can be written as a direct sum
π = π1 ⊕ π2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ πm
where the πj are irreducible.
Proof. If (π, V ) is not irreducible, there exists a W ⊂ V such that (π|W , W )
is a representation, and
(π, V ) = (π|W , W ) ⊕ (π|W ⊥ , W ⊥ )
Here, W ⊥ is the orthogonal complement of W in V (with respect to the
Hermitian inner product on V ). (π|W ⊥ , W ⊥ ) is a subrepresentation since, by
unitarity, the representation matrices preserve the Hermitian inner product.
The same argument can be applied to W and W ⊥ , and continue until (π, V )
is decomposed into a direct sum of irreducibles.

Note that non-unitary representations may not be decomposable in this
way. For a simple example, consider the group of upper triangular 2 by 2
2
matrices,
  acting on V = C . The subspace W ⊂ V of vectors proportional
1
to
is a subrepresentation, but there is no complement to W in V that
0
is also a subrepresentation (the representation is not unitary, so there is no
orthogonal complement subrepresentation).

18

2 The Group U (1) and its Representations

Finding the decomposition of an arbitrary unitary representation into irreducible components can be a very non-trivial problem. Recall that one gets
explicit matrices for the π(g) of a representation (π, V ) only when a basis for
V is chosen. To see if the representation is reducible, one cannot just look to
see if the π(g) are all in block-diagonal form. One needs to ﬁnd out whether
there is some basis for V for which they are all in such form, something very
non-obvious from just looking at the matrices themselves.
The following theorem provides a criterion that must be satisﬁed for a
representation to be irreducible:
Theorem (Schur’s lemma). If a complex representation (π, V ) is irreducible,
then the only linear maps M : V → V commuting with all the π(g) are λ1,
multiplication by a scalar λ ∈ C.
Proof. Assume that M commutes with all the π(g). We want to show that
(π, V ) irreducible implies M = λ1. Since we are working over the ﬁeld C
(this does not work for R), we can always solve the eigenvalue equation
det(M − λ1) = 0
to ﬁnd the eigenvalues λ of M . The eigenspaces
Vλ = {v ∈ V : M v = λv}
are nonzero vector subspaces of V and can also be described as ker(M − λ1),
the kernel of the operator M − λ1. Since this operator and all the π(g)
commute, we have
v ∈ ker(M − λ1) =⇒ π(g)v ∈ ker(M − λ1)
so ker(M − λ1) ⊂ V is a representation of G. If V is irreducible, we must
have either ker(M − λ1) = V or ker(M − λ1) = 0. Since λ is an eigenvalue,
ker(M − λ1) = 0, so ker(M − λ1) = V , and thus, M = λ1 as a linear
operator on V .

More concretely Schur’s lemma says that for an irreducible representation, if
a matrix M commutes with all the representation matrices π(g), then M must
be a scalar multiple of the unit matrix. Note that the proof crucially uses the
fact that eigenvalues exist. This will only be true in general if one works with
C and thus with complex representations. For the theory of representations
on real vector spaces, Schur’s lemma is no longer true.

2.1

Some representation theory

19

An important corollary of Schur’s lemma is the following characterization
of irreducible representations of G when G is commutative.
Theorem 2.2. If G is commutative, all of its irreducible representations are
one dimensional.
Proof. For G commutative, g ∈ G, any representation will satisfy
π(g)π(h) = π(h)π(g)
for all h ∈ G. If π is irreducible, Schur’s lemma implies that, since they
commute with all the π(g), the matrices π(h) are all scalar matrices, i.e.,
π(h) = λh 1 for some λh ∈ C. π is then irreducible when it is the one
dimensional representation given by π(h) = λh .

2.2 The group U (1) and its representations
One might think that the simplest Lie group is the one-dimensional additive group R, a group that we will study together with its representations
beginning in chapter 10. It turns out that one gets a much easier to analyze
Lie group by adding a periodicity condition (which removes the problem of
what happens as you go to ±∞), getting the “circle group” of points on a
unit circle. Each such point is characterized by an angle, and the group law
is addition of angles.
The circle group can be identiﬁed with the group of rotations of the plane
R2 , in which case it is called SO(2), for reasons discussed in chapter 4. It
is quite convenient, however, to identify R2 with the complex plane C and
work with the following group (which is isomorphic to SO(2)):
Definition (The group U (1)). The elements of the group U (1) are points
on the unit circle, which can be labeled by a unit complex number eiθ , or
an angle θ ∈ R with θ and θ + N 2π labeling the same group element for
N ∈ Z. Multiplication of group elements is complex multiplication, which by
the properties of the exponential satisfies
eiθ1 eiθ2 = ei(θ1 +θ2 )
so in terms of angles the group law is addition (mod 2π).
The name “U (1)” is used since complex numbers eiθ are 1 by 1 unitary
matrices.

By theorem 2.2, since U (1) is a commutative group, all irreducible representations will be one dimensional. Such an irreducible representation will be
given by a diﬀerentiable map
π : U (1) → GL(1, C)
GL(1, C) is the group of invertible complex numbers, also called C∗ . A diﬀerentiable map π that is a representation of U (1) must satisfy homomorphism
and periodicity properties which can be used to show:
Theorem 2.3. All irreducible representations of the group U (1) are unitary
and given by
πk : eiθ ∈ U (1) → πk (θ) = eikθ ∈ U (1) ⊂ GL(1, C)  C∗
for k ∈ Z.
Proof. We will write the πk as a function of an angle θ ∈ R, so satisfying the
periodicity property
πk (2π) = πk (0) = 1
Since it is a representation, π will satisfy the homomorphism property

2.2

Denoting the constant f  (0) by c, the only solutions to this diﬀerential equation satisfying f (0) = 1 are
f (θ) = ecθ
Requiring periodicity, we ﬁnd
f (2π) = ec2π = f (0) = 1
which implies c = ik for k ∈ Z, and f = πk for some integer k.



The representations we have found are all unitary, with πk taking values in
U (1) ⊂ C∗ . The complex numbers eikθ satisfy the condition to be a unitary
1 by 1 matrix, since
(eikθ )−1 = e−ikθ = eikθ
These representations are restrictions to the unit circle U (1) of irreducible
representations of the group C∗ , which are given by
πk : z ∈ C∗ → πk (z) = z k ∈ C∗
Such representations are not unitary, but they have an extremely simple form,
so it sometimes is convenient to work with them, later restricting to the unit
circle, where the representation is unitary.

2.3 The charge operator
Recall from chapter 1, the claim of a general principle that, when the state
space H is a unitary representation of a Lie group, we get an associated
self-adjoint operator on H. We will now illustrate this for the simple case

2 The Group U (1) and its Representations

22

of G = U (1), where the self-adjoint operator we construct will be called the
charge operator and denoted Q.
If the representation of U (1) on H is irreducible, by theorem 2.2 it must be
one dimensional with H = C. By theorem 2.3, it must be of the form (πq , C)
for some q ∈ Z. In this case, the self-adjoint operator Q is multiplication of
elements of H by the integer q. Note that the integrality condition on q is
needed because of the periodicity condition on θ, corresponding to the fact
that we are working with the group U (1), not the group R.
For a general U (1) representation, by theorems 2.1 and 2.3 we have
H = Hq1 ⊕ Hq2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Hqn
for some set of integers q1 , q2 , . . . , qn (n is the dimension of H, the qj may
not be distinct), where Hqj is a copy of C, with U (1) acting by the πqj
representation. One can then deﬁne
Definition. The charge operator Q for the U (1) representation (π, H) is
the self-adjoint linear operator on H that acts by multiplication by qj on the
irreducible subrepresentation Hqj . Taking basis elements in Hqj it acts on H
as the matrix

Thinking of H as a quantum mechanical state space, Q is our ﬁrst example
of a quantum mechanical observable, a self-adjoint operator on H. States in
the subspaces Hqj will be eigenvectors for Q and will have a well-deﬁned
numerical value for this observable, the integer qj . A general state will be a
linear superposition of state vectors from diﬀerent Hqj , and there will not be
a well-deﬁned numerical value for the observable Q on such a state.
From the action of Q on H, the representation can be recovered. The action
of the group U (1) on H is given by multiplying by i and exponentiating, to get

The standard physics terminology is that “Q is the generator of the U (1)
action by unitary transformations on the state space H.”
The general abstract mathematical point of view (which we will discuss in
much more detail in chapter 5) is that a representation π is a map between
manifolds, from the Lie group U (1) to the Lie group GL(n, C), that takes the
identity of U (1) to the identity of GL(n, C). As such it has a diﬀerential π  ,

2.3

The charge operator

23

which is a linear map from the tangent space at the identity of U (1) (which
here is iR) to the tangent space at the identity of GL(n, C) (which is the
space M (n, C) of n by n complex matrices). The tangent space at the identity
of a Lie group is called a “Lie algebra.” In later chapters, we will study many
diﬀerent examples of such Lie algebras and such maps π  , with the linear map
π  often determining the representation π.
In the U (1) case, the relation between the diﬀerential of π and the operator
Q is

that cannot be inverted). It has a distinguished point, the identity. The representation π takes the circle U (1) to a circle inside U (n). Its derivative π 
is a linear map taking the tangent space iR to the circle at the identity to a
line in the tangent space to U (n) at the identity.

2 The Group U (1) and its Representations

24

In the very simple example G = U (1), this abstract picture is over-kill
and likely confusing. We will see the same picture though occurring in many
other much more complicated examples in later chapters. Just like in this
U (1) case, for ﬁnite dimensional representations the linear maps π  will be
matrices, and the representation matrices π can be found by exponentiating
the π  .

2.4 Conservation of charge and U (1)
symmetry
The way we have deﬁned observable operators in terms of a group representation on H, the action of these operators has nothing to do with the dynamics.
If we start at time t = 0 in a state in Hqj , with deﬁnite numerical value qj for
the observable, there is no reason that time evolution should preserve this.
Recall from one of our basic axioms that time evolution of states is given by
the Schrödinger equation
d
|ψ(t) = −iH|ψ(t)
dt
(we have set  = 1). We will later more carefully study the relation of this
equation to the symmetry of time translation (the Hamiltonian operator H
generates an action of the group R of time translations, just as the operator
Q generates an action of the group U (1)). For now though, note that for
time-independent Hamiltonian operators H, the solution to this equation is
given by exponentiating H, with
|ψ(t) = U (t)|ψ(0)
where
U (t) = e−itH = 1 − itH +

(−it)2 2
H + ···
2!

The commutator of two operators O1 , O2 is deﬁned by
[O1 , O2 ] := O1 O2 − O2 O1
and such operators are said to commute if [O1 , O2 ] = 0. If the Hamiltonian
operator H and the charge operator Q commute, then Q will also commute
with all powers of H
[H k , Q] = 0

2.4

Conservation of charge and U (1) symmetry

25

and thus with the exponential of H, so
[U (t), Q] = 0
This condition
U (t)Q = QU (t)

(2.1)

implies that if a state has a well-deﬁned value qj for the observable Q at time
t = 0, it will continue to have the same value at any other time t, since
Q|ψ(t) = QU (t)|ψ(0) = U (t)Q|ψ(0) = U (t)qj |ψ(0) = qj |ψ(t)
This will be a general phenomenon: if an observable commutes with the
Hamiltonian observable, one gets a conservation law. This conservation law
says that if one starts in a state with a well-deﬁned numerical value for the
observable (an eigenvector for the observable operator), one will remain in
such a state, with the value not changing, i.e., “conserved.”
When [Q, H] = 0, the group U (1) is said to act as a “symmetry group”
of the system, with π(eiθ ) the “symmetry transformations.” Equation 2.1
implies that
U (t)eiQθ = eiQθ U (t)
so the action of the U (1) group on the state space of the system commutes
with the time evolution law determined by the choice of Hamiltonian. It
is only when a representation determined by Q has this particular property
that the action of the representation is properly called an action by symmetry
transformations and that one gets conservation laws. In general [Q, H] = 0,
with Q then generating a unitary action on H that does not commute with
time evolution and does not imply a conservation law.

2.5 Summary
To summarize the situation for G = U (1), we have found
• Irreducible representations π are one dimensional and characterized by
their derivative π  at the identity. If G = R, π  could be any complex
number. If G = U (1), periodicity requires that π  must be iq, q ∈ Z, so
irreducible representations are labeled by an integer.
• An arbitrary representation π of U (1) is of the form
π(eiθ ) = eiθQ

2 The Group U (1) and its Representations

where Q is a matrix with eigenvalues a set of integers qj . For a quantum
system, Q is the self-adjoint observable corresponding to the U (1) group
action on the system and is said to be a “generator” of the group action.
• If [Q, H] = 0, the U (1) group acts on the state space as “symmetries.”
In this case, the qj will be “conserved quantities,” numbers that characterize the quantum states, and do not change as the states evolve in
time.
Note that we have so far restricted attention to ﬁnite dimensional representations. In section 11.1, we will consider an important inﬁnite dimensional
case, a representation on functions on the circle which is essentially the theory of Fourier series. This comes from the action of U (1) on the circle by
rotations, giving an induced representation on functions by equation 1.3.

2.6 For further reading
I’ve had trouble ﬁnding another source that covers the material here. Most
quantum mechanics books consider it somehow too trivial to mention, starting their discussion of group actions and symmetries with more complicated
examples.

Chapter 3

Two-state Systems and SU (2)

The simplest truly non-trivial quantum systems have state spaces that are
inherently two-complex dimensional. This provides a great deal more structure than that seen in chapter 2, which could be analyzed by breaking up the
space of states into one-dimensional subspaces of given charge. We will study
these two-state systems in this section, encountering for the ﬁrst time the
implications of working with representations of a non-commutative group.
Since they give the simplest non-trivial realization of many quantum phenomena, such systems are the fundamental objects of quantum information
theory (the “qubit”) and the focus of attempts to build a quantum computer (which would be built out of multiple copies of this sort of fundamental
object). Many diﬀerent possible two-state quantum systems could potentially
be used as the physical implementation of a qubit.
One of the simplest possibilities to take would be the idealized situation of
a single electron, somehow ﬁxed so that its spatial motion could be ignored,
leaving its quantum state described solely by its so-called “spin degree of
freedom,” which takes values in H = C2 . The term “spin” is supposed to
call to mind the angular momentum of an object spinning about some axis,
but such classical physics has nothing to do with the qubit, which is a purely
quantum system.
In this chapter, we will analyze what happens for general quantum systems
with H = C2 by ﬁrst ﬁnding the possible observables. Exponentiating these
will give the group U (2) of unitary 2 by 2 matrices acting on H = C2 . This is
a speciﬁc representation of U (2), the “deﬁning” representation. By restricting
to the subgroup SU (2) ⊂ U (2) of elements of determinant one, one gets a
representation of SU (2) on C2 often called the “spin 12 ” representation.
Later on, in chapter 8, we will ﬁnd all the irreducible representations of
SU (2). These are labeled by a natural number
N = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .

and have dimension N + 1. The corresponding quantum systems are said to
have “spin N /2.” The case N = 0 is the trivial representation on C, and the
case N = 1 is the case of this chapter. In the limit N → ∞, one can make
contact with classical notions of spinning objects and angular momentum, but
the spin 12 case is at the other limit, where the behavior is purely quantummechanical.

3.1 The two-state quantum system
3.1.1 The Pauli matrices: observables
of the two-state quantum system
For a quantum system with two-dimensional state space H = C2 , observables
are self-adjoint linear operators on C2 . With respect to a chosen basis of C2 ,
these are 2 by 2 complex matrices M satisfying the condition M = M † (M †
is the conjugate-transpose of M ). Any such matrix will be a (real) linear
combination of four matrices:
M = c0 1 + c1 σ1 + c2 σ2 + c3 σ3
with cj ∈ R and the standard choice of basis elements given by

where the σj are called the “Pauli matrices.” This choice of basis is a convention, with one aspect of this convention that of taking the basis element
in the 3-direction to be diagonal. In common physical situations and conventions, the third direction is the distinguished “up-down” direction in space,
so often chosen when a distinguished direction in R3 is needed.
Recall that the basic principle of how measurements are supposed to work
in quantum theory says that the only states that have well-deﬁned values
for these four observables are the eigenvectors for these matrices, where the
value is the eigenvalue, real since the operator is self-adjoint. The ﬁrst matrix
gives a trivial observable (the identity on every state), whereas the last one,
σ3 , has the two eigenvectors

with eigenvalues +1 and −1. In quantum information theory, where this is
the qubit system, these two eigenstates are labeled |0 and |1 because of the
analogy with a classical bit of information. When we get to the theory of spin
in chapter 7, we will see that the observable 12 σ3 corresponds (in a non-trivial
way) to the action of the group SO(2) = U (1) of rotations about the third
spatial axis, and the eigenvalues − 21 , + 12 of this operator will be used to label
the two eigenstates, so

Such eigenstates | + 12  and | − 12  provide a basis for C2 , so an arbitrary
vector in H can be written as
1
1
|ψ = α| +  + β| − 
2
2
for α, β ∈ C. Only if α or β is 0 does the observable σ3 correspond to a
well-deﬁned number that characterizes the state and can be measured. This
will be either 12 (if β = 0 so the state is an eigenvector | + 12 ), or − 12 (if α = 0
so the state is an eigenvector | − 12 ).
An easy to check fact is that | + 12  and | − 12  are NOT eigenvectors
for the operators σ1 and σ2 . One can also check that no pair of the three
σj commutes, which implies that there are no vectors that are simultaneous
eigenvectors for more than one σj . This non-commutativity of the operators
is responsible for the characteristic paradoxical property of quantum observables: There exist states with a well-deﬁned number for the measured value
of one observable σj , but such states will not have a well-deﬁned number for
the measured value of the other two non-commuting observables.
The physical description of this phenomenon in the realization of this
system as a spin 12 particle is that if one prepares states with a well-deﬁned
spin component in the j-direction, the two other components of the spin
cannot be assigned a numerical value in such a state. Any attempt to prepare
states that simultaneously have speciﬁc chosen numerical values for the 3
observables corresponding to the σj is doomed to failure. So is any attempt to
simultaneously measure such values: If one measures the value for a particular
observable σj , then going on to measure one of the other two will ensure that
the ﬁrst measurement is no longer valid (repeating it will not necessarily give
the same thing). There are many subtleties in the theory of measurement for
quantum systems, but this simple two-state example already shows some of

(σ1 + iσ2 ) is called a “raising operator”: On eigenvectors of σ3 , it either
increases the eigenvalue by 2, or annihilates the vector. (σ1 − iσ2 ) is called a
“lowering operator”: On eigenvectors of σ3 , it either decreases the eigenvalue
by 2, or annihilates the vector. Note that these linear combinations are not
self-adjoint and are not observables, (σ1 + iσ2 ) is the adjoint of (σ1 − iσ2 )
and vice versa.

3.1.2 Exponentials of Pauli matrices: unitary
transformations of the two-state system
We saw in chapter 2 that in the U (1) case, knowing the observable operator Q on H determined the representation of U (1), with the representation
matrices found by exponentiating iθQ. Here, we will ﬁnd the representation corresponding to the two-state system observables by exponentiating
the observables in a similar way.
Taking the identity matrix ﬁrst, multiplication by iθ and exponentiation
gives the diagonal unitary matrix

This matrix commutes with any other 2 by 2 matrix, so we can treat its
action on H independently of the action of the σj .
Turning to the other three basis elements of the space of observables,
the Pauli matrices, it turns out that since all the σj satisfy σj2 = 1, their
exponentials also take a simple form.

As θ goes from θ = 0 to θ = 2π, this exponential traces out a circle in the
space of unitary 2 by 2 matrices, starting and ending at the unit matrix. This
circle is a group, isomorphic to U (1). So, we have found three diﬀerent U (1)
subgroups inside the unitary 2 by 2 matrices, but only one of them (the case
j = 3) will act diagonally on H, with the U (1) representation determined by



Q=
0 −1
For the other two cases j = 1 and j = 2, by a change of basis either one
could be put in the same diagonal form, but doing this for one value of j makes
the other two no longer diagonal. To understand the SU (2) action on H, one
needs to consider not just the U (1) subgroups, but the full three-dimensional
SU (2) group one gets by exponentiating general linear combinations of Pauli
matrices.
To compute such exponentials, one can check that these matrices satisfy
the following relations, useful in general for doing calculations with them
instead of multiplying out explicitly the 2 by 2 matrices:
[σj , σk ]+ ≡ σj σk + σk σj = 2δjk 1

(3.2)

Here, [·, ·]+ is called the anticommutator. This relation says that all σj satisfy
σj2 = 1 and distinct σj anticommute (e.g., σj σk = −σk σj for j = k).
Notice that the anticommutation relations imply that, if we take a vector
v = (v1 , v2 , v3 ) ∈ R3 and deﬁne a 2 by 2 matrix by

v·σ = v1 σ1 + v2 σ2 + v3 σ3 =

v3
v1 + iv2



3 Two-state Systems and SU (2)

32

then taking powers of this matrix we ﬁnd
(v · σ)2 = (v12 + v22 + v32 )1 = |v|2 1
If v is a unit vector, we have

1
(v · σ) =
v·σ
n

n even
n odd

Replacing σj by v · σ, the same calculation as for equation 3.1 gives (for
v a unit vector)
(3.3)
eiθv·σ = (cos θ)1 + i(sin θ)v · σ
Notice that the inverse of this matrix can easily be computed by taking
θ to −θ
(eiθv·σ )−1 = (cos θ)1 − i(sin θ)v · σ
We will review linear algebra and the notion of a unitary matrix in
chapter 4, but one form of the condition for a matrix M to be unitary is
M † = M −1
so the self-adjointness of the σj implies unitarity of eiθv·σ since
(eiθv·σ )† = ((cos θ)1 + i(sin θ)v · σ)†
= ((cos θ)1 − i(sin θ)v · σ † )
= ((cos θ)1 − i(sin θ)v · σ)
= (eiθv·σ )−1
The determinant of eiθv·σ can also easily be computed
det(eiθv·σ ) = det((cos θ)1 + i(sin θ)v · σ)


cos θ + i(sin θ)v3 i(sin θ)(v1 − iv2 )
= det
i(sin θ)(v1 + iv2 ) cos θ − i(sin θ)v3
= cos2 θ + (sin2 θ)(v12 + v22 + v32 )
=1
So, we see that by exponentiating i times linear combinations of the selfadjoint Pauli matrices (which all have trace zero), we get unitary matrices
of determinant one. These are invertible and form the group named SU (2),
the group of unitary 2 by 2 matrices of determinant one. If we exponentiated
not just iθv · σ, but i(φ1 + θv · σ) for some real constant φ (such matrices

3.1

The two-state quantum system

will not have trace zero unless φ = 0), we would get a unitary matrix with
determinant ei2φ . The group of all unitary 2 by 2 matrices is called U (2). It
contains as subgroups SU (2) as well as the U (1) described at the beginning of
this section. U (2) is slightly diﬀerent from the product of these two subgroups,
since the group element

SU (n) and U (n), groups of unitary n by n complex matrices.

where (α, β) ∈ C2 and

|α|2 + |β|2 = 1

The elements of SU (2) are thus parametrized by two complex numbers,
with the sum of their length-squared equal to one. Identifying C2 = R4 ,
these are vectors of length one in R4 . Just as U (1) could be identiﬁed as a
space with the unit circle S 1 in C = R2 , SU (2) can be identiﬁed with the
unit three-sphere S 3 in R4 .

3.2 Commutation relations for Pauli
matrices
An important set of relations satisﬁed by Pauli matrices are their commutation relations:
3

(3.4)
[σj , σk ] ≡ σj σk − σk σj = 2i
jkl σl
l=1

where jkl satisﬁes 123 = 1, is antisymmetric under permutation of two of its
subscripts, and vanishes if two of the subscripts take the same value. More
explicitly, this says:
[σ1 , σ2 ] = 2iσ3 , [σ2 , σ3 ] = 2iσ1 , [σ3 , σ1 ] = 2iσ2
These relations can easily be checked by explicitly computing with the matrices. Putting together equations 3.2 and 3.4 gives a formula for the product
of two Pauli matrices:
σj σk = δjk 1 + i

jkl σl

While physicists prefer to work with the self-adjoint Pauli matrices and
their real eigenvalues, the skew-adjoint matrices

can instead be used. These satisfy the slightly simpler commutation relations
[Xj , Xk ] =

or more explicitly
[X1 , X2 ] = X3 , [X2 , X3 ] = X1 , [X3 , X1 ] = X2

(3.5)

The non-triviality of the commutators reﬂects the non-commutativity of the
group. Group elements U ∈ SU (2) near the identity satisfy
U

1 + 1 X1 + 2 X2 + 3 X3

for j small and real, just as group elements z ∈ U (1) near the identity satisfy

The Xj and their commutation relations can be thought of as an inﬁnitesimal version of the full group and its group multiplication law, valid near the
identity. In terms of the geometry of manifolds, recall that SU (2) is the space
S 3 . The Xj give a basis of the tangent space R3 to the identity of SU (2),
just as i gives a basis of the tangent space to the identity of U (1).

3.3 Dynamics of a two-state system
Recall that the time-dependence of states in quantum mechanics is given by
the Schrödinger equation
d
|ψ(t) = −iH|ψ(t)
dt
where H is a particular self-adjoint linear operator on H, the Hamiltonian
operator. Considering the case of H time-independent, the most general such
operator H on C2 will be given by
H = h0 1 + h 1 σ 1 + h 2 σ 2 + h 3 σ 3
for four real parameters h0 , h1 , h2 , h3 . The solution to the Schrödinger equation is then given by exponentiation:
|ψ(t) = U (t)|ψ(0)
where

U (t) = e−itH

The h0 1 term in H contributes an overall phase factor e−ih0 t , with the
remaining factor of U (t) an element of the group SU (2) rather than the
larger group U (2) of all 2 by 2 unitaries.
Using our equation 3.3, valid for a unit vector v, our U (t) is given by
h
, and θ = −t|h|, so we ﬁnd
taking h = (h1 , h2 , h3 ), v = |h|

In this special case, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are h0 ± h3 .

spatial motion), the Hamiltonian is given by
H=

(3.6)

where the Bj are the components of the magnetic ﬁeld, and the physical
constants are the gyromagnetic ratio (g), the electric charge (e), the mass
(m), and the speed of light (c). By computing U (t) above, we have solved the
ge

problem of ﬁnding the time evolution of such a system, setting hj = 4mc
For the special case of a magnetic ﬁeld in the 3-direction (B1 = B2 = 0), we
see that the two diﬀerent states with well-deﬁned energy (| + 12  and | − 12 ,
recall that the energy is the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian) will have an
energy diﬀerence between them of
2h3 =

2mc

This is known as the Zeeman eﬀect and is readily visible in the spectra of
atoms subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld. We will consider this example in more
detail in chapter 7, seeing how the group of rotations of R3 enters into the
story. Much later, in chapter 45, we will derive the Hamiltonian 3.6 from
general principles of how electromagnetic ﬁelds couple to spin 12 particles.

3.4 For further reading
Many quantum mechanics textbooks now begin with the two-state system,
giving a much more detailed treatment than the one given here, including
much more about the physical interpretation of such systems (see, e.g., [96]).
Volume III of Feynman’s Lectures on Physics [25] is a quantum mechanics
text with much of the ﬁrst half devoted to two-state systems. The ﬁeld of
“Quantum Information Theory” gives a perspective on quantum theory that
puts such systems (in this context called the “qubit”) front and center. One
possible reference for this material is John Preskill’s notes on quantum computation [69].

Linear Algebra Review, Unitary
and Orthogonal Groups

A signiﬁcant background in linear algebra will be assumed in later chapters,
and we will need a range of speciﬁc facts from that subject. These will include
some aspects of linear algebra not emphasized in a typical linear algebra
course, such as the role of the dual space and the consideration of various
classes of invertible matrices as deﬁning a group. For now, our vector spaces
will be ﬁnite dimensional. Later on, we will come to state spaces that are
inﬁnite dimensional and will address the various issues that this raises at
that time.

4.1 Vector spaces and linear maps
A vector space V over a ﬁeld k is a set with a consistent way to take linear
combinations of elements with coeﬃcients in k. We will only be using the
cases k = R and k = C, so such ﬁnite dimensional V will just be Rn or Cn .
Choosing a basis (set of n linearly independent vectors) {ej }, an arbitrary
vector v ∈ V can be written as follows:
v = v1 e1 + v2 e2 + · · · + vn en

The reader should be warned that we will often not notationally distinguish
between a linear operator L and its matrix with matrix entries Ljk with
respect to some unspeciﬁed basis, since we are often interested in properties
of operators L that, for the corresponding matrix, are basis-independent (e.g.,
is the operator or matrix invertible?). The invertible linear operators on V
form a group under composition, a group we will sometimes denote GL(V ),
with “GL” indicating “General Linear.” Choosing a basis identiﬁes this group
with the group of invertible matrices, with group law matrix multiplication.
For V n-dimensional, we will denote this group by GL(n, R) in the real case,
GL(n, C) in the complex case.

We see from this that we can think of the transformed vector as we did
above in terms of transformed coeﬃcients vj with respect to ﬁxed basis vectors but also could leave the vj unchanged and transform the basis vectors.
At times, we will want to use matrix notation to write formulas for how the
basis vectors transform in this way and then will write

Note that putting the basis vectors ej in a column vector like this causes the
matrix for L to act on them by the transposed matrix.

Dual vector spaces

4.2 Dual vector spaces
To any vector space V , we can associate a new vector space, its dual:
Definition (Dual vector space). For V a vector space over a ﬁeld k, the dual
vector space V ∗ is the vector space of all linear maps V → k, i.e.,
V ∗ = {l : V → k such that l(αv + βw) = αl(v) + βl(w)}
for α, β ∈ k, v, w ∈ V .
Given a linear transformation L acting on V , we can deﬁne:
Definition (Transpose transformation). The transpose of L is the linear
transformation
Lt : V ∗ → V ∗
given by

(Lt l)(v) = l(Lv)

(4.1)

for l ∈ V ∗ , v ∈ V .
For any choice of basis {ej } of V , there is a dual basis {e∗j } of V ∗ that
satisﬁes
e∗j (ek ) = δjk
Coordinates on V with respect to a basis are linear functions, and thus elements of V ∗ . The coordinate function vj can be identiﬁed with the dual basis
vector e∗j since
e∗j (v) = e∗j (v1 e1 + v2 e2 + · · · + vn en ) = vj
It can easily be shown that the elements of the matrix for L in the basis ej
are given by
Ljk = e∗j (Lek )
and that the matrix for the transpose map (with respect to the dual basis)
is the matrix transpose
(LT )jk = Lkj
Matrix notation can be used to write elements
l = l1 e∗1 + l2 e∗2 + · · · + ln e∗n ∈ V ∗
of V ∗ as row vectors

For any representation (π, V ) of a group G on V , we can deﬁne a corresponding representation on V ∗ :
Definition (Dual or contragredient representation). The dual or contragredient representation on V ∗ is given by taking as linear operators
(π −1 )t (g) : V ∗ → V ∗

(4.2)

These satisfy the homomorphism property since
(π −1 (g1 ))t (π −1 (g2 ))t = (π −1 (g2 )π −1 (g1 ))t = ((π(g1 )π(g2 ))−1 )t
One way to characterize this representation is as the action on V ∗ such that
pairings between elements of V ∗ and V are invariant, since
l(v) → ((π −1 (g))t l)(π(g)v) = l(π(g)−1 π(g)v) = l(v)

Change of basis

43

4.3 Change of basis
Any invertible transformation A on V can be used to change the basis ej of
V to a new basis ej by taking
ej → ej = Aej
The matrix for a linear transformation L transforms under this change of
basis as follows:
Ljk = e∗j (Lek ) → (ej )∗ (Lek ) =(Aej )∗ (LAek )
=(AT )−1 (e∗j )(LAek )
=e∗j (A−1 LAek )
=(A−1 LA)jk
In the second step, we are using the fact that elements of the dual basis
transform as the dual representation. This is what is needed to ensure the
relation
(ej )∗ (ek ) = δjk
The change of basis formula shows that if two matrices L1 and L2 are
related by conjugation by a third matrix A
L2 = A−1 L1 A
then they represent the same linear transformation, with respect to two different choices of basis. Recall that a ﬁnite dimensional representation is given
by a set of matrices π(g), one for each group element. If two representations
are related by
π2 (g) = A−1 π1 (g)A
(for all g, A does not depend on g), then we can think of them as being
the same representation, with diﬀerent choices of basis. In such a case, the
representations π1 and π2 are called “equivalent,” and we will often implicitly
identify representations that are equivalent.

4.4 Inner products
An inner product on a vector space V is an additional structure that provides
a notion of length for vectors, of angle between vectors, and identiﬁes V ∗  V .
In the real case:

44

4 Linear Algebra Review, Unitary and Orthogonal Groups

Definition (Inner product, real case). An inner product on a real vector
space V is a symmetric ((v, w) = (w, v)) map
(·, ·) : V × V → R
that is non-degenerate and linear in both variables.
Our real inner products will usually be positive-deﬁnite ((v, v) ≥ 0 and
(v, v) = 0 =⇒ v = 0), with indeﬁnite inner products only appearing in
the context of special relativity, where an indeﬁnite inner product on fourdimensional space–time is used.
In the complex case:
Definition (Inner product, complex case). A Hermitian inner product on a
complex vector space V is a map
·, · : V × V → C
that is conjugate symmetric
v, w = w, v
non-degenerate in both variables, linear in the second variable, and antilinear
in the ﬁrst variable: for α ∈ C and u, v, w ∈ V
u + v, w = u, w + v, w, αu, v = αu, v
An inner product gives a notion of length-squared || · ||2 for vectors, with
||v||2 = v, v
Note that whether to specify antilinearity in the ﬁrst or second variable is a
matter of convention. The choice we are making is universal among physicists,
with the opposite choice common among mathematicians. Our Hermitian
inner products will be positive-deﬁnite (||v||2 > 0 for v = 0) unless speciﬁcally
noted otherwise (i.e., characterized explicitly as an indeﬁnite Hermitian inner
product).
An inner product also provides an isomorphism V  V ∗ by the map
v ∈ V → lv ∈ V ∗
where lv is deﬁned by

lv (w) = (v, w)

(4.3)

4.4

Inner products

45

in the real case, and
lv (w) = v, w
in the complex case (where this is a complex antilinear rather than linear
isomorphism).
Physicists have a useful notation due to Dirac for elements of a vector
space and its dual, for the case when V is a complex vector space with a
Hermitian inner product (such as the state space H for a quantum theory).
An element of such a vector space V is written as a “ket vector”
|α
where α is a label for a vector in V . Sometimes the vectors in question will be
eigenvectors for some observable operator, with the label α the eigenvalue.
An element of the dual vector space V ∗ is written as a “bra vector”
α|
with the labeling in terms of α determined by the isomorphism 4.3, i.e.,
α| = l|α
Evaluating α| ∈ V ∗ on |β ∈ V gives an element of C, written
α|(|β) = α|β
Note that in the inner product, the angle bracket notation means something
diﬀerent than in the bra-ket notation. The similarity is intentional though
since α|β is the inner product of a vector labeled by α and a vector labeled
by β (with “bra-ket” a play on words based on this relation to the inner
product bracket notation). Recalling what happens when one interchanges
vectors in a Hermitian inner product, one has
β|α = α|β
For a choice of orthonormal basis {ej }, i.e., satisfying
ej , ek  = δjk
a useful choice of label is the index j, so
|j = ej
Because of orthonormality, coeﬃcients of vectors |α with respect to the basis
{ej } are

46

j|α
and the expansion of a vector in terms of the basis is written
n

|α =

Similarly, for elements α| ∈ V ∗ ,

and this kind of expression is referred to by physicists as a “completeness
relation,” since it requires that the set of |j be a basis with no missing
elements. The operator
Pj = |jj|
is the projection operator onto the jth basis vector.
Digression. In this book, all of our indices will be lower indices. One way to
keep straight the diﬀerence between vectors and dual vectors is to use upper
indices for components of vectors and lower indices for components of dual
vectors. This is quite useful in Riemannian geometry and general relativity,
where the inner product is given by a metric that can vary from point to point,
causing the isomorphism between vectors and dual vectors to also vary. For
quantum mechanical state spaces, we will be using a single, standard, ﬁxed
inner product, so there will be a single isomorphism between vectors and dual
vectors. In this case, the bra-ket notation can be used to provide a notational
distinction between vectors and dual vectors.

4.5 Adjoint operators
When V is a vector space with inner product, the adjoint of L can be deﬁned
by:
Definition (Adjoint operator). The adjoint of a linear operator L : V → V
is the operator L† satisfying
Lv, w = v, L† w
for all v, w ∈ V .
Note that mathematicians tend to favor L∗ as notation for the adjoint of L,
as opposed to the physicist’s notation L† that we are using.
In terms of explicit matrices, since lLv is the conjugate-transpose of Lv,
the matrix for L† will be given by the conjugate-transpose LT of the matrix
for L:
L†jk = Lkj
In the real case, the matrix for the adjoint is just the transpose matrix. We
will say that a linear transformation is self-adjoint if L† = L, skew-adjoint if
L† = −L.

48

4 Linear Algebra Review, Unitary and Orthogonal Groups

4.6 Orthogonal and unitary
transformations
A special class of linear transformations will be invertible transformations
that preserve the inner product, i.e., satisfying
Lv, Lw = v, w
for all v, w ∈ V . Such transformations take orthonormal bases to orthonormal
bases, so one role in which they appear is as a change of basis between two
orthonormal bases.
In terms of adjoints, this condition becomes
Lv, Lw = v, L† Lw = v, w
so

L† L = 1

or equivalently

L† = L−1

In matrix notation, this ﬁrst condition becomes
n

(L† )jk Lkl =

k=1

n

Lkj Lkl = δjl
k=1

which says that the column vectors of the matrix for L are orthonormal
vectors. Using instead the equivalent condition
LL† = 1
we ﬁnd that the row vectors of the matrix for L are also orthonormal. Since
such linear transformations preserving the inner product can be composed
and are invertible, they form a group, and some of the basic examples of Lie
groups are given by these groups for the cases of real and complex vector
spaces.

4.6.1 Orthogonal groups
We will begin with the real case, where these groups are called orthogonal
groups:

4.6

Orthogonal and unitary transformations

49

Definition (Orthogonal group). The orthogonal group O(n) in n dimensions
is the group of invertible transformations preserving an inner product on a
real n-dimensional vector space V . This is isomorphic to the group of n by n
real invertible matrices L satisfying
L−1 = LT
The subgroup of O(n) of matrices with determinant 1 (equivalently, the subgroup preserving orientation of orthonormal bases) is called SO(n).
Recall that for a representation π of a group G on V , there is a dual
representation on V ∗ given by taking the transpose-inverse of π. If G is an
orthogonal group, then π and its dual are the same matrices, with V identiﬁed
by V ∗ by the inner product.
Since the determinant of the transpose of a matrix is the same as the
determinant of the matrix, we have
L−1 L = 1 =⇒ det(L−1 ) det(L) = det(LT ) det(L) = (det(L))2 = 1
so
det(L) = ±1
O(n) is a continuous Lie group, with two components distinguished by the
sign of the determinant: SO(n), the subgroup of orientation-preserving transformations, which include the identity, and a component of orientationchanging transformations.
The simplest non-trivial example is for n = 2, where all elements of SO(2)
are given by matrices of the form
cos θ
sin θ

− sin θ
cos θ

These matrices give counterclockwise rotations in R2 by an angle θ. The
other component of O(2) will be given by matrices of the form
cos θ
sin θ

sin θ
− cos θ

which describe a reﬂection followed by a rotation. Note that the group SO(2)
is isomorphic to the group U (1) by
cos θ
sin θ

− sin θ
cos θ

↔ eiθ

50

4 Linear Algebra Review, Unitary and Orthogonal Groups

so the representation theory of SO(2) is just as for U (1), with irreducible
complex representations one-dimensional and classiﬁed by an integer.
In chapter 6, we will consider in detail the case of SO(3), which is crucial
for physical applications because it is the group of rotations in the physical
three-dimensional space.

4.6.2 Unitary groups
In the complex case, groups of invertible transformations preserving the Hermitian inner product are called unitary groups:
Definition (Unitary group). The unitary group U (n) in n dimensions is the
group of invertible transformations preserving a Hermitian inner product on
a complex n-dimensional vector space V . This is isomorphic to the group of
n by n complex invertible matrices satisfying
T

L−1 = L = L†
The subgroup of U (n) of matrices with determinant 1 is called SU (n).
In the unitary case, the dual of a representation π has representation matrices
that are transpose-inverses of those for π, but
(π(g)T )−1 = π(g)
so the dual representation is given by conjugating all elements of the matrix.
The same calculation as in the real case here gives
det(L−1 ) det(L) = det(L† ) det(L) = det(L) det(L) = | det(L)|2 = 1
so det(L) is a complex number of modulus one. The map
L ∈ U (n) → det(L) ∈ U (1)
is a group homomorphism.
We have already seen the examples U (1), U (2), and SU (2). For general
values of n, the study of U (n) can be split into that of its determinant, which
lies in U (1) so is easy to deal with, followed by the subgroup SU (n), which
is a much more complicated story.
Digression. Note that it is not quite true that the group U (n) is the product
group SU (n) × U (1). If one tries to identify the U (1) as the subgroup of U (n)
of elements of the form eiθ 1, then matrices of the form

4.6

Orthogonal and unitary transformations

51

m

ei n 2π 1
for m an integer will lie in both SU (n) and U (1), so U (n) is not a product
of those two groups (it is an example of a semi-direct product, these will be
discussed in chapter 18).
We saw at the end of section 3.1.2 that SU (2) can be identiﬁed with the
three-sphere S 3 , since an arbitrary group element can be constructed by specifying one row (or one column), which must be a vector of length one in C2 .
For the case n = 3, the same sort of construction starts by picking a row
of length one in C3 , which will be a point in S 5 . The second row must be
orthonormal, and it can be shown that the possibilities lie in a three-sphere
S 3 . Once the ﬁrst two rows are speciﬁed, the third row is uniquely determined.
So as a manifold, SU (3) is eight-dimensional, and one might think it could
be identiﬁed with S 5 × S 3 . It turns out that this is not the case, since the
S 3 varies in a topologically non-trivial way as one varies the point in S 5 .
As spaces, the SU (n) are topologically “twisted” products of odd-dimensional
spheres, providing some of the basic examples of quite non-trivial topological
manifolds.

4.7 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
We have seen that the matrix for a linear transformation L of a vector space
V changes by conjugation, when we change our choice of basis of V . To
get basis-independent information about L, one considers the eigenvalues of
the matrix. Complex matrices behave in a much simpler fashion than real
matrices, since in the complex case the eigenvalue equation
det(λ1 − L) = 0

(4.5)

can always be factored into linear factors. For an arbitrary n by n complex
matrix, there will be n solutions (counting repeated eigenvalues with multiplicity). A basis will exist for which the matrix will be in upper triangular
form.
The case of self-adjoint matrices L is much more constrained, since transposition relates matrix elements. One has:
Theorem 4.1 (Spectral theorem for self-adjoint matrices). Given a selfadjoint complex n by n matrix L, there exists a unitary matrix U such that
U LU −1 = D
where D is a diagonal matrix with entries Djj = λj , λj ∈ R.

52

4 Linear Algebra Review, Unitary and Orthogonal Groups

Given L, its eigenvalues λj are the solutions to the eigenvalue equation 4.5
and U is determined by the eigenvectors. For distinct eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenvectors are orthogonal.
This spectral theorem here is a theorem about ﬁnite dimensional vector
spaces and matrices, but there are analogous theorems for self-adjoint operators on inﬁnite dimensional state spaces. Such a theorem is of crucial importance in quantum mechanics, where for L an observable, the eigenvectors are
the states in the state space with well-deﬁned numerical values characterizing
the state, and these numerical values are the eigenvalues. The theorem tells
us that, given an observable, we can use it to choose distinguished orthonormal bases for the state space by picking a basis of eigenvectors, normalized
to length one.
Using the bra-ket notation in this case, we can label elements of such a
basis by their eigenvalues, so
|j = |λj 
(the λj may include repeated eigenvalues). A general state is written as a
linear combination of basis states
|jj|ψ

|ψ =
j

which is sometimes written as a “resolution of the identity operator”
|jj| = 1

(4.6)

j

Turning from self-adjoint to unitary matrices, unitary matrices can also
be diagonalized by conjugation by another unitary. The diagonal entries will
all be complex numbers of unit length, so of the form eiλj , λj ∈ R. For the
simplest examples, consider the cases of the groups SU (2) and U (2). Any
matrix in U (2) can be conjugated by a unitary matrix to the diagonal matrix

which is the exponential of a corresponding diagonalized skew-adjoint matrix

Chapter 5

Lie Algebras and Lie
Algebra Representations

In this chapter, we will introduce Lie algebras and Lie algebra representations, which provide a tractable linear construction that captures much of the
behavior of Lie groups and Lie group representations. We have so far seen
the case of U (1), for which the Lie algebra is trivial, and a little bit about
the SU (2) case, where the ﬁrst non-trivial Lie algebra appears. Chapters 6
and 8 will provide details showing how the general theory works out for the
basic examples of SU (2), SO(3), and their representations. The very general
nature of the material in this chapter may make it hard to understand until
one has some experience with examples that only appear in later chapters.
The reader is thus advised that it may be a good idea to ﬁrst skim the material of this chapter, returning for a deeper understanding and better insight
into these structures after ﬁrst seeing them in action later on in more concrete
contexts.
For a group G, we have deﬁned unitary representations (π, V ) for ﬁnite
dimensional vector spaces V of complex dimension n as homomorphisms
π : G → U (n)
Recall that in the case of G = U (1) (see the proof of theorem 2.3) we could
use the homomorphism property of π to determine π in terms of its derivative
at the identity. This turns out to be a general phenomenon for Lie groups
G: We can study their representations by considering the derivative of π at
the identity, which we will call π  . Because of the homomorphism property,
knowing π  is often suﬃcient to characterize the representation π it comes
from. π  is a linear map from the tangent space to G at the identity to the
tangent space of U (n) at the identity. The tangent space to G at the identity
will carry some extra structure coming from the group multiplication, and
this vector space with this structure will be called the Lie algebra of G. The
linear map π  will be an example of a Lie algebra representation.
The subject of diﬀerential geometry gives many equivalent ways of deﬁning
the tangent space at a point of manifolds like G, but we do not want to enter

here into the subject of diﬀerential geometry in general. One of the standard
deﬁnitions of the tangent space is as the space of tangent vectors, with tangent
vectors deﬁned as the possible velocity vectors of parametrized curves g(t) in
the group G.
More advanced treatments of Lie group theory develop this point of view
(see, e.g., [98]) which applies to arbitrary Lie groups, whether or not they
are groups of matrices. In our case though, since we are interested in speciﬁc
groups that are usually explicitly given as groups of matrices, in such cases
we can give a more concrete deﬁnition, using the exponential map on matrices. For a more detailed exposition of this subject, using the same concrete
deﬁnition of the Lie algebra in terms of matrices, see, for instance, [42] or the
abbreviated online version [40].

5.1 Lie algebras
If a Lie group G is deﬁned as a diﬀerentiable manifold with a group law,
one can consider the tangent space at the identity, and that will be the Lie
algebra of G. We are, however, interested mainly in cases where G is a matrix
group, and in such cases, the Lie algebra can be deﬁned more concretely:
Definition (Lie algebra). For G a Lie group of n by n invertible matrices,
the Lie algebra of G (written Lie(G) or g) is the space of n by n matrices X
such that etX ∈ G for t ∈ R.
Here, the exponential of a matrix is given by usual power series formula for
the exponential
1
1
eA = 1 + A + A2 + · · · + An + · · ·
2
n!
which can be shown to converge (like the usual exponential), for any matrix
A. While this deﬁnition is more concrete than deﬁning a Lie algebra as a
tangent space, it does not make obvious some general properties of a Lie
algebra, in particular that a Lie algebra is a real vector space (see theorem
3.20 of [42]). Our main interest will be in using it to recognize certain speciﬁc
Lie algebras corresponding to speciﬁc Lie groups.
Notice that while the group G determines the Lie algebra g, the Lie algebra
does not determine the group. For example, O(n) and SO(n) have the same
tangent space at the identity and thus the same Lie algebra, but elements in
O(n) not in the component of the identity (i.e., with determinant −1) cannot
be written in the form etX (since then you could make a path of matrices
connecting such an element to the identity by shrinking t to zero).
Note also that, for a given X, diﬀerent values of t may give the same
group element, and this may happen in diﬀerent ways for diﬀerent groups

5.1

Lie algebras

57

sharing the same Lie algebra. For example, consider G = U (1) and G = R,
which both have the same Lie algebra g = R. In the ﬁrst case, an inﬁnity of
values of t gives the same group element, and in the second, only one does.
In chapter 6, we will see a more subtle example of this: SU (2) and SO(3) are
diﬀerent groups with the same Lie algebra.
We have G ⊂ GL(n, C) and X ∈ M (n, C), the space of n by n complex
matrices. For all t ∈ R, the exponential etX is an invertible matrix (with
inverse e−tX ), so in GL(n, C). For each X, we thus have a path of elements
of GL(n, C) going through the identity matrix at t = 0, with velocity vector
d tX
e = XetX
dt
which takes the value X at t = 0:
d tX
(e )|t=0 = X
dt
To calculate this derivative, use the power series expansion for the exponential
and diﬀerentiate term-by-term.
For the case G = GL(n, C), we have gl(n, C) = M (n, C), which is a linear
space of the right dimension to be the tangent space to G at the identity, so
this deﬁnition is consistent with our general motivation. For subgroups G ⊂
GL(n, C) given by some condition (e.g., that of preserving an inner product),
we will need to identify the corresponding condition on X ∈ M (n, C) and
check that this deﬁnes a linear space.
The existence of such a linear space g ⊂ M (n, C) will provide us with
a distinguished representation on a real vector space, called the “adjoint
representation”:
Definition (Adjoint representation). The adjoint representation (Ad, g) is
given by the homomorphism
Ad : g ∈ G → Ad(g) ∈ GL(g)
where Ad(g) acts on X ∈ g by
(Ad(g))(X) = gXg −1
To show that this is well deﬁned, one needs to check that gXg −1 ∈ g when
X ∈ g, but this can be shown using the identity

It is also easy to check that this is a homomorphism, with
Ad(g1 )Ad(g2 ) = Ad(g1 g2 )
A Lie algebra g is not just a real vector space, but comes with an extra
structure on the vector space:
Definition (Lie bracket). The Lie bracket operation on g is the bilinear
antisymmetric map given by the commutator of matrices
[·, ·] : (X, Y ) ∈ g × g → [X, Y ] = XY − Y X ∈ g
We need to check that this is well deﬁned, i.e., that it takes values in g.
Theorem. If X, Y ∈ g, [X, Y ] = XY − Y X ∈ g.
Proof. Since X ∈ g, we have etX ∈ G and we can act on Y ∈ g by the adjoint
representation
Ad(etX )Y = etX Y e−tX ∈ g
As t varies, this gives us a parametrized curve in g. Its velocity vector will
also be in g, so

One has (by the product rule, which can easily be shown to apply in this

To do calculations with a Lie algebra, one can choose a basis X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn
for the vector space g and use the fact that the Lie bracket can be written in
terms of this basis as
n

[Xj , Xk ] =
cjkl Xl
(5.2)
l=1

where cjkl is a set of constants known as the “structure constants” of the Lie
algebra. For example, in the case of su(2), the Lie algebra of SU (2) has a
basis X1 , X2 , X3 satisfying
[Xj , Xk ] =

3


jkl Xl

l=1

(see equation 3.5) so the structure constants of su(2) are the totally antisymmetric jkl .

5.2 Lie algebras of the orthogonal
and unitary groups
The groups we are most interested in are the groups of linear transformations
preserving an inner product: the orthogonal and unitary groups. We have
seen that these are subgroups of GL(n, R) or GL(n, C), consisting of those
elements Ω satisfying the condition
ΩΩ† = 1
In order to see what this condition becomes on the Lie algebra, write Ω = etX ,
for some parameter t, and X a matrix in the Lie algebra. Since the transpose
of a product of matrices is the product (order-reversed) of the transposed
matrices, i.e.,
(XY )T = Y T X T
and the complex conjugate of a product of matrices is the product of the
complex conjugates of the matrices, one has
(etX )† = etX
The condition

ΩΩ† = 1

†

60

5 Lie Algebras and Lie Algebra Representations

thus becomes

†

etX (etX )† = etX etX = 1

Taking the derivative of this equation gives
†

†

etX X † etX + XetX etX = 0
Evaluating this at t = 0 gives
X + X† = 0
so the matrices we want to exponentiate must be skew-adjoint (it can be
shown that this is also a suﬃcient condition), satisfying
X † = −X
Note that physicists often choose to deﬁne the Lie algebra in these cases
as self-adjoint matrices, then multiplying by i before exponentiating to get
a group element. We will not use this deﬁnition, with one reason that we
want to think of the Lie algebra as a real vector space, so want to avoid an
unnecessary introduction of complex numbers at this point.

5.2.1 Lie algebra of the orthogonal group
Recall that the orthogonal group O(n) is the subgroup of GL(n, R) of matrices Ω satisfying ΩT = Ω−1 . We will restrict attention to the subgroup SO(n)
of matrices with determinant 1, which is the component of the group containing the identity, with elements that can be written as
Ω = etX
These give a path connecting Ω to the identity (taking esX , s ∈ [0, t]). We
saw above that the condition ΩT = Ω−1 corresponds to skew-symmetry of
the matrix X
X T = −X
So in the case of G = SO(n), we see that the Lie algebra so(n) is the space of
skew-symmetric (X T = −X) n by n real matrices, together with the bilinear,
antisymmetric product given by the commutator:
(X, Y ) ∈ so(n) × so(n) → [X, Y ] ∈ so(n)

5.2

Lie algebras of the orthogonal and unitary groups

61

The dimension of the space of such matrices will be
1 + 2 + · · · + (n − 1) =

n2 − n
2

and a basis will be given by the matrices jk , with j, k = 1, . . . , n, j < k
deﬁned as
⎧
⎪
⎨−1 if j = l, k = m
(5.3)
(jk )lm = +1 if j = m, k = l
⎪
⎩
0
otherwise
In chapter 6, we will examine in detail the n = 3 case, where the Lie algebra
so(3) is R3 , realized as the space of antisymmetric real 3 by 3 matrices, with
a basis the three matrices 12 , 13 , 23 .

5.2.2 Lie algebra of the unitary group
For the case of the group U (n), the unitarity condition implies that X is
skew-adjoint (also called skew-Hermitian), satisfying
X † = −X
So the Lie algebra u(n) is the space of skew-adjoint n by n complex matrices,
together with the bilinear, antisymmetric product given by the commutator:
(X, Y ) ∈ u(n) × u(n) → [X, Y ] ∈ u(n)
2

Note that these matrices form a subspace of Cn of half the dimension,
so of real dimension n2 . u(n) is a real vector space of dimension n2 , but it is
NOT a space of real n by n matrices. It is the space of skew-Hermitian matrices, which in general are complex. While the matrices are complex, only real
linear combinations of skew-Hermitian matrices are skew-Hermitian (recall
that multiplication by i changes a skew-Hermitian matrix into a Hermitian
matrix). Within this space of skew-Hermitian complex matrices, if one looks
at the subspace of real matrices one gets the sub-Lie algebra so(n) of antisymmetric matrices (the Lie algebra of SO(n) ⊂ U (n)).
Any complex matrix Z ∈ M (n, C) can be written as a sum of
Z=

1
1
(Z + Z † ) + (Z − Z † )
2
2

where the ﬁrst term is self-adjoint and the second skew-Hermitian. This second term can also be written as i times a self-adjoint matrix

62

(Z − Z † ) = i





(Z − Z † )

so we see that we can get all of M (n, C) by taking all complex linear combinations of self-adjoint matrices.
There is an identity relating the determinant and the trace of a matrix
det(eX ) = etrace(X)
which can be proved by conjugating the matrix to upper triangular form and
using the fact that the trace and the determinant of a matrix are conjugation
invariant. Since the determinant of an SU (n) matrix is 1, this shows that the
Lie algebra su(n) of SU (n) will consist of matrices that are not only skewHermitian, but also of trace zero. So in this case, su(n) is again a real vector
space, with the trace zero condition a single linear condition giving a vector
space of real dimension n2 − 1.
One can show that U (n) and u(n) matrices can be diagonalized by conjugation by a unitary matrix and thus show that any U (n) matrix can be
written as an exponential of something in the Lie algebra. The corresponding
theorem is also true for SO(n) but requires looking at diagonalization into
2 by 2 blocks. It is not true for O(n) (you cannot reach the disconnected
component of the identity by exponentiation). It also turns out to not be
true for the groups SL(n, R) and SL(n, C) for n ≥ 2 (while the groups are
connected, they have elements that are not exponentials of any matrix in
sl(n, R) or sl(2, C), respectively).

5.3 A summary
Before turning to Lie algebra representations, we will summarize here the
classes of Lie groups and Lie algebras that we have discussed and that we
will be studying speciﬁc examples of in later chapters:
• The general linear groups GL(n, R) and GL(n, C) are the groups of all
invertible matrices, with real or complex entries, respectively. Their Lie
algebras are gl(n, R) = M (n, R) and gl(n, C) = M (n, C). These are
the vector spaces of all n by n matrices, with Lie bracket the matrix
commutator.
Other Lie groups will be subgroups of these, with Lie algebras sub-Lie
algebras of these Lie algebras.
• The special linear groups SL(n, R) and SL(n, C) are the groups of
invertible matrices with determinant one. Their Lie algebras sl(n, R)
and sl(n, C) are the Lie algebras of all n by n matrices with zero trace.

5.3

A summary

63

• The orthogonal group O(n) ⊂ GL(n, R) is the group of n by n real
matrices Ω satisfying ΩT = Ω−1 . Its Lie algebra o(n) is the Lie algebra
of n by n real matrices X satisfying X T = −X.
• The special orthogonal group SO(n) ⊂ SL(n, R) is the subgroup of O(n)
with determinant one. It has the same Lie algebra as O(n): so(n) = o(n).
• The unitary group U (n) ⊂ GL(n, C) is the group of n by n complex
matrices Ω satisfying Ω† = Ω−1 . Its Lie algebra u(n) is the Lie algebra
of n by n skew-Hermitian matrices X, those satisfying X † = −X.
• The special unitary group SU (n) ⊂ SL(n, C) is the subgroup of U (n)
of matrices of determinant one. Its Lie algebra su(n) is the Lie algebra
of n by n skew-Hermitian matrices X with trace zero.
In later chapters, we will encounter some other examples of matrix Lie
groups, including the symplectic group Sp(2d, R) (see chapter 16) and the
pseudo-orthogonal groups O(r, s) (see chapter 29).

5.4 Lie algebra representations
We have deﬁned a group representation as a homomorphism (a map of groups
preserving group multiplication)
π : G → GL(n, C)
We can similarly deﬁne a Lie algebra representation as a map of Lie algebras
preserving the Lie bracket:
Definition (Lie algebra representation). A (complex) Lie algebra representation (φ, V ) of a Lie algebra g on an n-dimensional complex vector space V
is given by a real linear map
φ : X ∈ g → φ(X) ∈ gl(n, C) = M (n, C)
satisfying
φ([X, Y ]) = [φ(X), φ(Y )]
Such a representation is called unitary if its image is in u(n), i.e., if it satisfies
φ(X)† = −φ(X)
More concretely, given a basis X1 , X2 , . . . , Xd of a Lie algebra g of dimension d with structure constants cjkl , a representation is given by a choice of d
complex n-dimensional matrices φ(Xj ) satisfying the commutation relations

64

cjkl φ(Xl )

l=1

The representation is unitary when the matrices are skew-adjoint.
The notion of a Lie algebra representation is motivated by the fact that
the homomorphism property causes the map π to be largely determined by
its behavior inﬁnitesimally near the identity and thus by the derivative π  .
One way to deﬁne the derivative of such a map is in terms of velocity vectors
of paths, and this sort of deﬁnition in this case associates to a representation
π : G → GL(n, C) a linear map
π  : g → M (n, C)

For the case of U (1), we classiﬁed in theorem 2.3 all irreducible representations (homomorphisms U (1) → GL(1, C) = C∗ ) by looking at the derivative
of the map at the identity. For general Lie groups G, something similar can be
done, showing that a representation π of G gives a representation of the Lie
algebra (by taking the derivative at the identity) and then trying to classify
Lie algebra representations.

This theorem shows that we can study Lie group representations (π, V )
by studying the corresponding Lie algebra representation (π  , V ). This will
generally be much easier since the π  are linear maps. Unlike the nonlinear
maps π, the map π  is determined by its value on basis elements Xj of g.
The π  (Xj ) will satisfy the same bracket relations as the Xj (see equation
5.2). We will proceed in this manner in chapter 8 when we construct and
classify all SU (2) and SO(3) representations, ﬁnding that the corresponding
Lie algebra representations are much simpler to analyze. Note though that
representations of the Lie algebra g do not necessarily correspond to representations of the group G (when they do they are called “integrable”). For
a simple example, looking at the proof of theorem 2.3, one gets unitary representations of the Lie algebra of U (1) for any value of the constant k, but
these are only representations of the group U (1) when k is integral.
For any Lie group G, we have seen that there is a distinguished representation, the adjoint representation (Ad, g). The corresponding Lie algebra representation is also called the adjoint representation, but written as
(Ad , g) = (ad, g). From the fact that
Ad(etX )(Y ) = etX Y e−tX
we can diﬀerentiate with respect to t and use equation 5.1 to get the Lie
algebra representation
ad(X)(Y ) =

d tX −tX
(e Y e
)|t=0 = [X, Y ]
dt

(5.4)

This leads to the deﬁnition:
Definition (Adjoint Lie algebra representation). (ad, g) is the Lie algebra
representation given by
X ∈ g → ad(X)

5.4

Lie algebra representations

67

where ad(X) is defined as the linear map from g to itself given by
Y → [X, Y ]
Note that this linear map ad(X), which can be written as [X, ·], can be
thought of as the inﬁnitesimal version of the conjugation action
(·) → etX (·)e−tX
The Lie algebra homomorphism property of ad says that
ad([X, Y ]) = ad(X) ◦ ad(Y ) − ad(Y ) ◦ ad(X)
where these are linear maps on g, with ◦ composition of linear maps, so
operating on Z ∈ g we have
ad([X, Y ])(Z) = (ad(X) ◦ ad(Y ))(Z) − (ad(Y ) ◦ ad(X))(Z)
Using our expression for ad as a commutator, we ﬁnd
[[X, Y ], Z] = [X, [Y, Z]] − [Y, [X, Z]]
This is called the Jacobi identity. It could have been more simply derived as
an identity about matrix multiplication, but here we see that it is true for a
more abstract reason, reﬂecting the existence of the adjoint representation.
It can be written in other forms, rearranging terms using antisymmetry of
the commutator, with one example the sum of cyclic permutations
[[X, Y ], Z] + [[Z, X], Y ] + [[Y, Z], X] = 0
Lie algebras can be deﬁned much more abstractly as follows:
Definition (Abstract Lie algebra). An abstract Lie algebra over a field k is
a vector space A over k, with a bilinear operation
[·, ·] : (X, Y ) ∈ A × A → [X, Y ] ∈ A
satisfying
1. Antisymmetry:
[X, Y ] = −[Y, X]
2. Jacobi identity:
[[X, Y ], Z] + [[Z, X], Y ] + [[Y, Z], X] = 0

68

5 Lie Algebras and Lie Algebra Representations

Such Lie algebras do not need to be deﬁned as matrices, and their Lie
bracket operation does not need to be deﬁned in terms of a matrix commutator (although the same notation continues to be used). Later on, we will
encounter important examples of Lie algebras that are deﬁned in this more
abstract way.

5.5 Complexification
Conventional physics discussion of Lie algebra representations proceed by
assuming complex coeﬃcients are allowed in all calculations, since we are
interested in complex representations. An important subtlety is that the Lie
algebra is a real vector space, often in a confusing way, as a subspace of
complex matrices. To properly keep track of what is going on, one needs to
understand the notion of “complexiﬁcation” of a vector space or Lie algebra.
In some cases, this is easily understood as just going from real to complex
coeﬃcients, but in other cases, a more complicated construction is necessary.
The reader is advised that it might be a good idea to just skim this section at
ﬁrst reading, coming back to it later only as needed to make sense of exactly
how things work when these subtleties make an appearance in a concrete
problem.
The way we have deﬁned a Lie algebra g, it is a real vector space, not a
complex vector space. Even if G is a group of complex matrices, its tangent
space at the identity will not necessarily be a complex vector space. Consider,
for example, the cases G = U (1) and G = SU (2), where u(1) = R and
su(2) = R3 . While the tangent space to the group GL(n, C) of all invertible
complex matrices is a complex vector space (M (n, C), all n by n matrices),
imposing some condition such as unitarity picks out a subspace of M (n, C)
which generally is just a real vector space, not a complex one. So the adjoint
representation (Ad, g) is in general not a complex representation, but a real
representation, with
Ad(g) ∈ GL(g) = GL(dim g, R)
The derivative of this is the Lie algebra representation
ad : X ∈ g → ad(X) ∈ gl(dim g, R)
and once we pick a basis of g, we can identify gl(dim g, R) = M (dim g, R).
So, for each X ∈ g, we get a real linear operator on a real vector space.
We most often would like to work with not real representations, but complex representations, since it is for these that Schur’s lemma applies (the proof
of 2.1 also applies to the Lie algebra case), and representation operators can

5.5

Complexification

69

be diagonalized. To get from a real Lie algebra representation to a complex
one, we can “complexify,” extending the action of real scalars to complex
scalars. If we are working with real matrices, complexiﬁcation is nothing but
allowing complex entries and using the same rules for multiplying matrices
as before.
More generally, for any real vector space, we can deﬁne:
Definition. The complexification VC of a real vector space V is the space of
pairs (v1 , v2 ) of elements of V with multiplication by a + bi ∈ C given by
(a + ib)(v1 , v2 ) = (av1 − bv2 , av2 + bv1 )
One should think of the complexiﬁcation of V as
VC = V + iV
with v1 in the ﬁrst copy of V and v2 in the second copy. Then, the rule
for multiplication by a complex number comes from the standard rules for
complex multiplication.
Given a real Lie algebra g, the complexiﬁcation gC is pairs of elements
(X, Y ) of g, with the above rule for multiplication by complex scalars, which
can be thought of as
gC = g + ig
The Lie bracket on g extends to a Lie bracket on gC by the rule
[(X1 , Y1 ), (X2 , Y2 )] = ([X1 , X2 ] − [Y1 , Y2 ], [X1 , Y2 ] + [Y1 , X2 ])
which can be understood by the calculation
[X1 + iY1 , X2 + iY2 ] = [X1 , X2 ] − [Y1 , Y2 ] + i([X1 , Y2 ] + [Y1 , X2 ])
With this Lie bracket, gC is a Lie algebra over the complex numbers.
For many of the cases we will be interested in, this level of abstraction
is not really needed, since they have the property that V will be given as a
subspace of a complex vector space, with the property that V ∩ iV = 0, in
which case VC will just be the larger subspace you get by taking complex
linear combinations of elements of V . For example, gl(n, R), the Lie algebra
of real n by n matrices, is a subspace of gl(n, C), the complex matrices, and
one can see that
gl(n, R)C = gl(n, C)
Recalling our discussion from section 5.2.2 of u(n), a real Lie algebra, with elements certain complex matrices (the skew-Hermitian ones), multiplication by
i gives the Hermitian ones, and complexifying will give all complex matrices

70

5 Lie Algebras and Lie Algebra Representations

so
u(n)C = gl(n, C)
This example shows that two diﬀerent real Lie algebras (u(n) and gl(n, R))
may have the same complexiﬁcation. For yet another example, so(n) is the
Lie algebra of all real antisymmetric matrices, so(n)C is the Lie algebra of
all complex antisymmetric matrices.
For an example where the general deﬁnition is needed and the situation
becomes easily confusing, consider the case of gl(n, C), thinking of it as a Lie
algebra and thus a real vector space. The complexiﬁcation of this real vector
space will have twice the (real) dimension, so
gl(n, C)C = gl(n, C) + igl(n, C)
will not be what you get by just allowing complex coeﬃcients (gl(n, C)), but
something built out of two copies of this.
Given a representation π  of a real Lie algebra g, it can be extended to a
representation of gC by complex linearity, deﬁning
π  (X + iY ) = π  (X) + iπ  (Y )
If the original representation was on a complex vector space V , the extended
one will act on the same space. If the original representation was on a real
vector space V , the extended one will act on the complexiﬁcation VC . Some
of the examples of these phenomena that we will encounter are the following:
• The adjoint representation
ad : g → gl(dim g, R) = M (dim g, R)
extends to a complex representation
ad : gC → gl(dim g, C) = M (dim g, C)
• Complex n-dimensional representations
π  : su(2) → M (n, C)
of su(2) extend to representations
π  : su(2)C = sl(2, C) → M (n, C)
Doing this allows one to classify the ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations of su(2) by studying sl(2, C) representations (see section
8.1.2).

5.5

• We will see that complex representations of a real Lie algebra called
the Heisenberg Lie algebra play a central role in quantum theory and in
quantum ﬁeld theory. An important technique for constructing such representations (using so-called “annihilation” and “creation” operators)
does so by extending the representation to the complexiﬁcation of the
Heisenberg Lie algebra (see section 22.4).
• Quantum ﬁeld theories based on complex ﬁelds start with a Heisenberg Lie algebra that is already complex (see chapter 37 for the case of
non-relativistic ﬁelds and section 44.1.2 for relativistic ﬁelds). The use
of annihilation and creation operators for such theories thus involves
complexifying a Lie algebra that is already complex, requiring the use
of the general notion of complexiﬁcation discussed in this section.

5.6 For further reading
The material of this section is quite conventional mathematics, with many
good expositions, although most aimed at a higher level than ours. Examples
at a similar level to this one are [85] and [93], which cover basics of Lie groups
and Lie algebras, but without representations. The notes [40] and book [42] of
Brian Hall are a good source for the subject at a somewhat more sophisticated
level than adopted here. Some parts of the proofs given in this chapter are
drawn from those two sources.

Chapter 6

The Rotation and Spin Groups
in Three and Four Dimensions

Among the basic symmetry groups of the physical world is the orthogonal group SO(3) of rotations about a point in three-dimensional space. The
observables one gets from this group are the components of angular momentum, and understanding how the state space of a quantum system behaves
as a representation of this group is a crucial part of the analysis of atomic
physics examples and many others. This is a topic one will ﬁnd in some version or other in every quantum mechanics textbook, and in chapter 8, we will
discuss it in detail.
Remarkably, it is an experimental fact that the quantum systems in nature
are often representations not of SO(3), but of a larger group called Spin(3),
one that has two elements corresponding to every element of SO(3). Such
a group exists in any dimension n, always as a “doubled” version of the
orthogonal group SO(n), one that is needed to understand some of the more
subtle aspects of geometry in n dimensions. In the n = 3 case, it turns out that
Spin(3)  SU (2), and in this chapter, we will study in detail the relationship
between SO(3) and SU (2). This appearance of the unitary group SU (2) is
special to geometry in 3 and 4 dimensions, and the theory of quaternions will
be used to provide an explanation for this.

that we have a representation on V = R2 here, but it is a real representation,
not one of the complex ones we have when we have a representation on a
quantum mechanical state space.
In three dimensions, the group SO(3) is three dimensional and noncommutative. Choosing a unit vector w and angle θ, one gets an element
R(θ, w) of SO(3), rotation by an angle θ about the w-axis. Using standard
basis vectors ej , rotations about the coordinate axes are given by

A standard parametrization for elements of SO(3) is in terms of 3 “Euler
angles” φ, θ, ψ with a general rotation given by
R(φ, θ, ψ) = R(ψ, e3 )R(θ, e1 )R(φ, e3 )

(6.1)

i.e., ﬁrst a rotation about the z-axis by an angle φ, then a rotation by an
angle θ about the new x-axis, followed by a rotation by ψ about the new
z-axis. Multiplying out the matrices gives a rather complicated expression
for a rotation in terms of the three angles, and one needs to ﬁgure out what
range to choose for the angles to avoid multiple counting.
The inﬁnitesimal picture near the identity of the group, given by the Lie
algebra structure on so(3), is much easier to understand. Recall that for
orthogonal groups, the Lie algebra can be identiﬁed with the space of antisymmetric matrices, so in this case there is a basis

Note that these are exactly the same commutation relations (equation 3.5)
satisﬁed by the basis vectors X1 , X2 , X3 of the Lie algebra su(2), so so(3) and
su(2) are isomorphic Lie algebras. They both are the vector space R3 with
the same Lie bracket operation on pairs of vectors. This operation is familiar
in yet another context, that of the cross product of standard basis vectors ej
in R3 :
e1 × e2 = e3 , e2 × e3 = e1 , e3 × e1 = e2
We see that the Lie bracket operation
(X, Y ) ∈ R3 × R3 → [X, Y ] ∈ R3
that makes R3 a Lie algebra so(3) is the cross product on vectors in R3 .
So far, we have three diﬀerent isomorphic ways of putting a Lie bracket
on R3 , making it into a Lie algebra:
1. Identify R3 with antisymmetric real 3 by 3 matrices and take the matrix
commutator as Lie bracket.
2. Identify R3 with skew-adjoint, traceless, complex 2 by 2 matrices and
take the matrix commutator as Lie bracket.
3. Use the vector cross product on R3 to get a Lie bracket, i.e., deﬁne
[v, w] = v × w
Something very special that happens for orthogonal groups only in dimension n = 3 is that the vector representation (the deﬁning representation of
SO(n) matrices on Rn ) is isomorphic to the adjoint representation. Recall
that any Lie group G has a representation (Ad, g) on its Lie algebra g. so(n)
can be identiﬁed with the antisymmetric n by n matrices, so is of (real)
2
dimension n 2−n . Only for n = 3 is this equal to n, the dimension of the
representation on vectors in Rn . This corresponds to the geometrical fact
that only in 3 dimensions is a plane (in all dimensions rotations are built out
of rotations in various planes) determined uniquely by a vector (the vector
perpendicular to the plane). Equivalently, only in 3 dimensions is there a
cross product v × w which takes two vectors determining a plane to a unique
vector perpendicular to the plane.
The isomorphism between the vector representation (πvector , R3 ) on column vectors and the adjoint representation (Ad, so(3)) on antisymmetric
matrices is given by

One can explicitly check that these representations are isomorphic, for
instance by calculating how basis elements lj ∈ so(3) act. On vectors, these

l1 e1 = 0, l1 e2 = e3 , l1 e3 = −e2
On antisymmetric matrices, one has instead the isomorphic relations
(ad(l1 ))(l1 ) = 0, (ad(l1 ))(l2 ) = l3 , (ad(l1 ))(l3 ) = −l2

6.2 Spin groups in three and four
dimensions
A subtle and remarkable property of the orthogonal groups SO(n) is that they
come with an associated group, called Spin(n), with every element of SO(n)
corresponding to two distinct elements of Spin(n). There is a surjective group
homomorphism
Φ : Spin(n) → SO(n)
with the inverse image of each element of SO(n) given by two distinct elements of Spin(n).

6.2

Digression. The topological reason for this is that (for n > 2), the fundamental group of SO(n) is non-trivial, with π1 (SO(n)) = Z2 (in particular,
there is a non-contractible loop in SO(n), contractible if you go around it
twice). Spin(n) is topologically the simply connected double cover of SO(n),
and the covering map Φ : Spin(n) → SO(n) can be chosen to be a group
homomorphism.
Spin(n) is a Lie group of the same dimension as SO(n), with an isomorphic tangent space at the identity, so the Lie algebras of the two groups are
isomorphic: so(n)  spin(n).
In chapter 29, we will explicitly construct the groups Spin(n) for any n,
but here we will only do this for n = 3 and n = 4, using methods speciﬁc
to these two cases. In the cases n = 5 (where Spin(5) = Sp(2), the 2 by 2
norm-preserving quaternionic matrices) and n = 6 (where Spin(6) = SU (4)),
special methods can be used to identify Spin(n) with other matrix groups.
For n > 6, the group Spin(n) will be a matrix group, but distinct from other
classes of such groups.
Given such a construction of Spin(n), we also need to explicitly construct
the homomorphism Φ, and show that its derivative Φ is an isomorphism of
Lie algebras. We will see that the simplest construction of the spin groups
here uses the group Sp(1) of unit-length quaternions, with Spin(3) = Sp(1)
and Spin(4) = Sp(1)×Sp(1). By identifying quaternions and pairs of complex
numbers, we can show that Sp(1) = SU (2) and thus work with these spin
groups as either 2 by 2 complex matrices (for Spin(3)), or pairs of such
matrices (for Spin(4)).

6.2.1 Quaternions
The quaternions are a number system (denoted by H) generalizing the complex number system, with elements q ∈ H that can be written as
q = q0 + q1 i + q2 j + q3 k, qj ∈ R
with i, j, k ∈ H satisfying
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1, ij = −ji = k, ki = −ik = j, jk = −kj = i
and a conjugation operation that takes
q → q̄ = q0 − q1 i − q2 j − q3 k

78

6 The Rotation and Spin Groups in 3 and 4 Dimensions

This operation satisﬁes (for u, v ∈ H)
uv = v̄ū
As a vector space over R, H is isomorphic with R4 . The length-squared
function on this R4 can be written in terms of quaternions as
|q|2 = q q̄ = q02 + q12 + q22 + q32
and is multiplicative since
|uv|2 = uvuv = uvv̄ū = |u|2 |v|2
Using

q q̄
=1
|q|2

one has a formula for the inverse of a quaternion
q −1 =

q̄
|q|2

The length one quaternions thus form a group under multiplication, called
Sp(1). There are also Lie groups called Sp(n) for larger values of n, consisting
of invertible matrices with quaternionic entries that act on quaternionic vectors preserving the quaternionic length-squared, but these play no signiﬁcant
role in quantum mechanics so we will not study them further. Sp(1) can be
identiﬁed with the three-dimensional sphere since the length one condition
on q is
q02 + q12 + q22 + q32 = 1
the equation of the unit sphere S 3 ⊂ R4 .

6.2.2 Rotations and spin groups in four dimensions
Pairs (u, v) of unit quaternions give the product group Sp(1) × Sp(1). An
element (u, v) of this group acts on q ∈ H = R4 by left and right quaternionic
multiplication
q → uqv −1

6.2

Spin groups in three and four dimensions

79

This action preserves lengths of vectors and is linear in q, so it must correspond to an element of the group SO(4). One can easily see that pairs (u, v)
and (−u, −v) give the same linear transformation of R4 , so the same element
of SO(4) and show that SO(4) is the group Sp(1) × Sp(1), with the two
elements (u, v) and (−u, −v) identiﬁed. The name Spin(4) is given to the Lie
group Sp(1) × Sp(1) that “double covers” SO(4) in this manner, with the
covering map
Φ : (u, v) ∈ Sp(1) × Sp(1) = Spin(4) → {q → uqv −1 } ∈ SO(4)

6.2.3 Rotations and spin groups in three
dimensions
Later on we will encounter Spin(4) and SO(4) again, but for now we are
interested in the subgroup Spin(3) that only acts non-trivially on 3 of the
dimensions, and double covers not SO(4) but SO(3). To ﬁnd this, consider
the subgroup of Spin(4) consisting of pairs (u, v) of the form (u, u) (a subgroup isomorphic to Sp(1), since elements correspond to a single unit-length
quaternion u). This subgroup acts on quaternions by conjugation
q → uqu−1
an action which is trivial on the real quaternions (since u(q0 1)u−1 = q0 1). It
preserves and acts non-trivially on the space of “pure imaginary” quaternions
of the form
q = v = v1 i + v2 j + v3 k
which can be identiﬁed with the vector space R3 . An element u ∈ Sp(1) acts
on v ∈ R3 ⊂ H as
v → uv u−1
This is a linear action, preserving the length |v |, so it corresponds to an
element of SO(3). We thus have a map (which can easily be checked to be a
homomorphism)
Φ : u ∈ Sp(1) → {v → uv u−1 } ∈ SO(3)

Figure 6.1: Double cover Sp(1) → SO(3).

Both u and −u act in the same way on v , so we have two elements in
Sp(1) corresponding to the same element in SO(3). One can show that Φ is
a surjective map (any element of SO(3) is Φ of something), so it is what is
called a “covering” map, speciﬁcally a twofold cover. It makes Sp(1) a double
cover of SO(3), and we give this group the name “Spin(3).” This also allows
us to characterize more simply SO(3) as a geometrical space. It is S 3 =
Sp(1) = Spin(3) with opposite points on the three-sphere identiﬁed. This
space is known as RP3 , real projective 3-space, which can also be thought
of as the space of lines through the origin in R4 (each such line intersects S 3
in two opposite points).
Digression. The covering map Φ is an example of a topologically non-trivial
cover. Topologically, it is not true that S 3  RP3 × (+1, −1). S 3 is a
connected space, not two disconnected pieces. This topological non-triviality
implies that globally there is no possible homomorphism going in the opposite
direction from Φ (i.e., SO(3) → Spin(3)). This can be done locally, picking a
local patch in SO(3) and taking the inverse of Φ to a local patch in Spin(3),
but this will not work if we try and extend it globally to all of SO(3).
The identiﬁcation R2 = C allowed us to represent elements of the unit
circle group U (1) as exponentials eiθ , where iθ was in the Lie algebra u(1) =
iR of U (1). Sp(1) behaves in much the same way, with the Lie algebra sp(1)

now the space of all pure imaginary quaternions, which can be identiﬁed with
R3 by
⎛ ⎞
w1
 = w1 i + w2 j + w3 k ∈ H
w = ⎝w2 ⎠ ∈ R3 ↔ w
w3
Unlike the U (1) case, there is a non-trivial Lie bracket, the commutator of
quaternions.
Elements of the group Sp(1) are given by exponentiating such Lie algebra
elements, which we will write in the form
u(θ, w) = eθw
where θ ∈ R and w
 is a purely imaginary quaternion of unit length. Since
w
 2 = (w1 i + w2 j + w3 k)2 = −(w12 + w22 + w32 ) = −1
the exponential can be expanded to show that
 sin θ
eθw = cos θ + w
Taking θ as a parameter, the u(θ, w) give paths in Sp(1) going through the
identity at θ = 0, with velocity vector w
 since
d
u(θ, w)|θ=0 = (− sin θ + w
 cos θ)|θ=0 = w

dθ
We can explicitly evaluate the homomorphism Φ on such elements
u(θ, w) ∈ Sp(1), with the result that Φ takes u(θ, w) to a rotation by an
angle 2θ around the axis w:
Theorem 6.1.
Φ(u(θ, w)) = R(2θ, w)
Proof. First, consider the special case w = e3 of rotations about the 3-axis.
u(θ, e3 ) = eθk = cos θ + k sin θ
and

u(θ, e3 )−1 = e−θk = cos θ − k sin θ

so Φ(u(θ, e3 )) is the rotation that takes v (identiﬁed with the quaternion
v = v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) to

82

6 The Rotation and Spin Groups in 3 and 4 Dimensions

u(θ, e3 )v u(θ, e3 )−1 =(cos θ + k sin θ)(v1 i + v2 j + v3 k)(cos θ − k sin θ)
=(v1 (cos2 θ − sin2 θ) − v2 (2 sin θ cos θ))i
+ (2v1 sin θ cos θ + v2 (cos2 θ − sin2 θ))j + v3 k
=(v1 cos 2θ − v2 sin 2θ)i + (v1 sin 2θ + v2 cos 2θ)j + v3 k

The same calculation can readily be done for the case of e1 , then use the
Euler angle parametrization of equation 6.1 to show that a general u(θ, w)
can be written as a product of the cases already worked out.

Notice that as θ goes from 0 to 2π, u(θ, w) traces out a circle in Sp(1).
The homomorphism Φ takes this to a circle in SO(3), one that gets traced
out twice as θ goes from 0 to 2π, explicitly showing the nature of the double
covering above that particular circle in SO(3).
The derivative of the map Φ will be a Lie algebra homomorphism, a linear
map
Φ : sp(1) → so(3)
It takes the Lie algebra sp(1) of pure imaginary quaternions to the Lie algebra
so(3) of 3 by 3 antisymmetric real matrices. One can compute it easily on
basis vectors, using, for instance, equation 6.2 above to ﬁnd for the case w

6.2.4 The spin group and SU (2)
Instead of doing calculations using quaternions with their non-commutativity
and special multiplication laws, it is more conventional to choose an isomorphism between quaternions H and a space of 2 by 2 complex matrices, and
work with matrix multiplication and complex numbers. The Pauli matrices
can be used to give such an isomorphism, taking

The correspondence between H and 2 by 2 complex matrices is then given

we see that the length-squared function on quaternions corresponds to the
determinant function on 2 by 2 complex matrices. Taking q ∈ Sp(1), so of
length one, the corresponding complex matrix is in SU (2).
Under this identiﬁcation of H with 2 by 2 complex matrices, we have an
identiﬁcation of Lie algebras sp(1) = su(2) between pure imaginary quaternions and skew-Hermitian trace-zero 2 by 2 complex matrices

This isomorphism identiﬁes basis vectors by

etc. The ﬁrst of these identiﬁcations comes from the way we chose to identify
H with 2 by 2 complex matrices. The second identiﬁcation is Φ , the derivative
at the identity of the covering map Φ.
On each of these isomorphic Lie algebras, we have adjoint Lie group (Ad)
and Lie algebra (ad) representations. Ad is given by conjugation with the
corresponding group elements in Sp(1), SU (2), and SO(3). ad is given by
taking commutators in the respective Lie algebras of pure imaginary quaternions, skew-Hermitian trace-zero 2 by 2 complex matrices, and 3 by 3 real
antisymmetric matrices.
Note that these three Lie algebras are all three-dimensional real vector
spaces, so these are real representations. To get a complex representation,
take complex linear combinations of elements. This is less confusing in the
case of su(2) than for sp(1) since taking complex linear combinations of skewHermitian trace-zero 2 by 2 complex matrices gives all trace-zero 2 by 2
matrices (the Lie algebra sl(2, C)).
In addition, recall that there is a fourth isomorphic version of this representation, the representation of SO(3) on column vectors. This is also a
real representation, but can straightforwardly be complexiﬁed. Since so(3)
and su(2) are isomorphic Lie algebras, their complexiﬁcations so(3)C and
sl(2, C) will also be isomorphic.
In terms of 2 by 2 complex matrices, Lie algebra elements can be exponentiated to get group elements in SU (2) and deﬁne

6.3 A summary
To summarize, we have shown that in the three-dimensional case, we have
two distinct Lie groups:

86

6 The Rotation and Spin Groups in 3 and 4 Dimensions

• Spin(3), which geometrically is the space S 3 . Its Lie algebra is R3 with
Lie bracket the cross product. We have seen two diﬀerent explicit constructions of Spin(3), in terms of unit quaternions (Sp(1)), and in terms
of 2 by 2 unitary matrices of determinant 1 (SU (2)).
• SO(3), which has a Lie algebra isomorphic to that of Spin(3).
There is a group homomorphism Φ that takes the ﬁrst group to the second,
which is a twofold covering map. Its derivative Φ is an isomorphism of the
Lie algebras of the two groups.
We can see from these constructions two interesting irreducible representations of these groups:
• A representation on R3 which can be constructed in two diﬀerent ways:
as the adjoint representation of either of the two groups, or as the deﬁning representation of SO(3). This is known to physicists as the “spin 1”
representation.
• A representation of the ﬁrst group on C2 , which is most easily seen as
the deﬁning representation of SU (2). It is not a representation of SO(3),
since going once around a non-contractible loop starting at the identity
takes one to minus the identity, not back to the identity as required. This
is called the “spin 12 ” or “spinor” representation and will be studied in
more detail in chapter 7.

6.4 For further reading
For another discussion of the relationship between SO(3) and SU (2) as well
as a construction of the map Φ, see [82], sections 4.2 and 4.3, as well as [3],
chapter 8, and [85], chapters 2 and 4.

Chapter 7

Rotations and the Spin 12 Particle
in a Magnetic Field

The existence of a non-trivial double cover Spin(3) of the three-dimensional
rotation group may seem to be a somewhat obscure mathematical fact.
Remarkably though, the existence of fundamental spin 12 particles shows that
it is Spin(3) rather than SO(3) that is the symmetry group corresponding to
rotations of fundamental quantum systems. Ignoring the degrees of freedom
describing their motion in space, which we will examine in later chapters,
states of elementary particles such as the electron are described by a state
space H = C2 , with rotations acting on this space by the two-dimensional
irreducible representation of SU (2) = Spin(3).
This is the same two-state system studied in Chapter 3, with the SU (2)
action found there now acquiring an interpretation as corresponding to the
double cover of the group of rotations of physical space. In this chapter, we
will revisit that example, emphasizing the relation to rotations.

7.1 The spinor representation
In chapter 6, we examined in great detail various ways of looking at a
particular three-dimensional irreducible real representation of the groups
SO(3), SU (2), and Sp(1). This was the adjoint representation for those three
groups, and isomorphic to the vector representation for SO(3). In the SU (2)
and Sp(1) cases, there is an even simpler non-trivial irreducible representation than the adjoint: the representation of 2 by 2 complex matrices in SU (2)
on column vectors C2 by matrix multiplication or the representation of unit
quaternions in Sp(1) on H by scalar multiplication. Choosing an identiﬁcation C2 = H, these are isomorphic representations on C2 of isomorphic
groups, and for calculational convenience, we will use SU (2) and its complex
matrices rather than dealing with quaternions. We thus have:

7 Rotations and the Spin 12 Particle in a Magnetic Field

Definition (Spinor representation). The spinor representation of Spin(3) =
SU (2) is the representation on C2 given by
g ∈ SU (2) → πspinor (g) = g
Elements of the representation space C2 are called “spinors.”
The spin representation of SU (2) is not a representation of SO(3). The
double cover map Φ : SU (2) → SO(3) is a homomorphism, so given a representation (π, V ) of SO(3) one gets a representation (π ◦ Φ, V ) of SU (2)
by composition. One cannot go in the other direction: there is no homomorphism SO(3) → SU (2) that would allow one to make the spin representation
of SU (2) on C2 into an SO(3) representation.
One could try and deﬁne a representation of SO(3) by
g ∈ SO(3) → π(g) = πspinor (g̃) ∈ SU (2)
where g̃ is some choice of one of the two elements g̃ ∈ SU (2) satisfying Φ(g̃) =
g. The problem with this is that it will not quite give a homomorphism.
Changing the choice of g̃ will introduce a minus sign, so π will only be a
homomorphism up to sign
π(g1 )π(g2 ) = ±π(g1 g2 )
The non-trivial nature of the double covering map Φ implies that there is no
way to completely eliminate all minus signs, no matter how one chooses g̃
(since a continuous choice of g̃ is not possible for all g in a non-contractible
loop of elements of SO(3)). Examples like this, which satisfy the representation property only one up to a sign ambiguity, are known as “projective
representations.” So, the spinor representation of SU (2) = Spin(3) can be
used to construct a projective representation of SO(3), but not a true representation of SO(3).
Quantum mechanics texts sometimes deal with this phenomenon by noting
that there is an ambiguity in how one speciﬁes physical states in H, since
multiplying a vector in H by a scalar does not change the eigenvalues of
operators or the relative probabilities of observing these eigenvalues. As a
result, the sign ambiguity noted above has no physical eﬀect since arguably
one should be working with states modulo the scalar ambiguity. It seems more
straightforward though to not try and work with projective representations,
but just use the larger group Spin(3), accepting that this is the correct group
reﬂecting the action of rotations on three-dimensional quantum systems.
The spin representation is more fundamental than the vector representation, in the sense that the spin representation cannot be found only knowing
the vector representation, but the vector representation of SO(3) can be constructed knowing the spin representation of SU (2). We have seen this using

7.1

The spinor representation

the identiﬁcation of R3 with 2 by 2 complex matrices, with equation 6.5
showing that rotations of R3 correspond to conjugation by spin representation matrices. Another way of seeing this uses the tensor product and is
explained in section 9.4.3. Note that taking spinors as fundamental entails
abandoning the description of three-dimensional geometry purely in terms
of real numbers. While the vector representation is a real representation of
SO(3) or Spin(3), the spinor representation is a complex representation.

7.2 The spin 12 particle in a magnetic field
In chapter 3, we saw that a general quantum system with H = C2 could be
understood in terms of the action of U (2) on C2 . The self-adjoint observables
correspond (up to a factor of i) to the corresponding Lie algebra representation. The U (1) ⊂ U (2) subgroup commutes with everything else and can
be analyzed separately; here, we will consider only the SU (2) subgroup. For
an arbitrary such system, the group SU (2) has no particular geometric signiﬁcance. When it occurs in its role as double cover of the rotational group,
the quantum system is said to carry “spin,” in particular “spin 12 ” for the
two-dimensional irreducible representation (in chapter 8, we will discuss state
spaces of higher spin values).
As before, we take as a standard basis for the Lie algebra su(2) the operators Xj , j = 1, 2, 3, where
σj
Xj = −i
2
which satisfy the commutation relations
[X1 , X2 ] = X3 , [X2 , X3 ] = X1 , [X3 , X1 ] = X2
To make contact with the physics formalism, we will deﬁne self-adjoint operators
σj
(7.1)
Sj = iXj =
2
In general, to a skew-adjoint operator (which is what one gets from a unitary
Lie algebra representation and what exponentiates to unitary operators) we
will associate a self-adjoint operator by multiplying by i. These self-adjoint
operators have real eigenvalues (in this case ± 12 ), so are favored by physicists
as observables since experimental results are given by real numbers. In the
other direction, given a physicist’s observable self-adjoint operator, we will
multiply by −i to get a skew-adjoint operator (which may be an operator for
a unitary Lie algebra representation).

7 Rotations and the Spin 12 Particle in a Magnetic Field

Note that the conventional deﬁnition of these operators in physics texts
includes a factor of :
σj
Sjphys = iXj =
2
A compensating factor of 1/ is then introduced when exponentiating to get
group elements
phys
θ
∈ SU (2)
Ω(θ, w) = e−i  w·S
which do not depend on . The reason for this convention has to do with the
action of rotations on functions on R3 (see chapter 19) and the appearance
of  in the deﬁnition of the momentum operator. Our deﬁnitions of Sj and
of rotations using (see equation 6.3)
Ω(θ, w) = e−iθw·S = eθw·X
will not include these factors of , but in any case they will be equivalent to
the usual physics deﬁnitions when we make our standard choice of working
with units such that  = 1.
States in H = C2 that have a well-deﬁned value of the observable Sj will
be the eigenvectors of Sj , with value for the observable the corresponding
eigenvalue, which will be ± 12 . Measurement theory postulates that if we perform the measurement corresponding to Sj on an arbitrary state |ψ, then
we will
• with probability c+ get a value of + 12 and leave the state in an eigenvector |j, + 12  of Sj with eigenvalue + 12
• with probability c− get a value of − 12 and leave the state in an eigenvector |j, − 12  of Sj with eigenvalue − 12
where if

we have
c+ =

|α|2
|α|2 + |β|2

, c− =

|β|2
|α|2 + |β|2

After such a measurement, any attempt to measure another Sk , k = j will give
± 12 with equal probability (since the inner products of |j, ± 12  and |k, ± 12  are
equal up to a phase) and put the system in a corresponding eigenvector of Sk .
If a quantum system is in an arbitrary state |ψ, it may not have a welldeﬁned value for some observable A, but the “expected value” of A can
be calculated. This is the sum over a basis of H consisting of eigenvectors
(which will all be orthogonal) of the corresponding eigenvalues, weighted by

7.2

91

the probability of their occurrence. The calculation of this sum in this case
(A = Sj ) using expansion in eigenvectors of Sj gives
ψ|A|ψ (αj, + 12 | + βj, − 12 |)A(α|j, + 12  + β|j, − 12 )

One often chooses to simplify such calculations by normalizing states so that
the denominator ψ|ψ is 1. Note that the same calculation works in general
for the probability of measuring the various eigenvalues of an observable A,
as long as one has orthogonality and completeness of eigenvectors.
In the case of a spin 12 particle, the group Spin(3) = SU (2) acts on states
by the spinor representation with the element Ω(θ, w) ∈ SU (2) acting as
|ψ → Ω(θ, w)|ψ
As we saw in chapter 6, the Ω(θ, w) also acts on self-adjoint matrices by
conjugation, an action that corresponds to rotation of vectors when one makes
the identiﬁcation
v ↔v·σ
(see equation 6.5). Under this identiﬁcation, the Sj correspond (up to a factor
of 2) to the basis vectors ej . Their transformation rule can be written as
Sj → Sj = Ω(θ, w)Sj Ω(θ, w)−1
and

Note that, recalling the discussion in section 4.1, rotations on sets of basis
vectors like this involve the transpose R(θ, w)T of the matrix R(θ, w) that
acts on coordinates.
Recalling the discussion in section 3.3, the spin degree of freedom that we
are describing by H = C2 has a dynamics described by the Hamiltonian
H = −μ · B

(7.2)

7 Rotations and the Spin 12 Particle in a Magnetic Field

Here, B is the vector describing the magnetic ﬁeld, and
μ=g

is an operator called the magnetic moment operator. The constants that
appear are: −e the electric charge, c the speed of light, m the mass of the particle, and g, a dimensionless number called the “gyromagnetic ratio,” which
is approximately 2 for an electron, about 5.6 for a proton.
The Schrödinger equation is

so is a rotation about w taking place with angular velocity ge|B|

The amount of non-trivial physics that is described by this simple system
is impressive, including:
• The Zeeman eﬀect: this is the splitting of atomic energy levels that
occurs when an atom is put in a constant magnetic ﬁeld. With respect
to the energy levels for no magnetic ﬁeld, where both states in H = C2
have the same energy, the term in the Hamiltonian given above adds
±

ge|B|
4mc

to the two energy levels, giving a splitting between them proportional
to the size of the magnetic ﬁeld.
• The Stern–Gerlach experiment: here, one passes a beam of spin 12 quantum systems through an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. We have not
yet discussed particle motion, so more is involved here than the simple
two-state system. However, it turns out that one can arrange this in
such a way as to pick out a speciﬁc direction w, and split the beam into
two components, of eigenvalue + 12 and − 12 for the operator w · S.

7.2

The spin 12 particle in a magnetic field

93

• Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: a spin 12 can be subjected to
a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld B(t), and such a system will be described
by the same Schrödinger equation (although now the solution cannot be
found just by exponentiating a matrix). Nuclei of atoms provide spin
1
2 systems that can be probed with time and space-varying magnetic
ﬁelds, allowing imaging of the material that they make up.
• Quantum computing: attempts to build a quantum computer involve
trying to put together multiple systems of this kind (qubits), keeping
them isolated from perturbations by the environment, but still allowing interaction with the system in a way that preserves its quantum
behavior.

7.3 The Heisenberg picture
The treatment of time-dependence so far has used what physicists call the
“Schrödinger picture” of quantum mechanics. States in H are functions of
time, obeying the Schrödinger equation determined by a Hamiltonian observable H, while observable self-adjoint operators O are time-independent. Time
evolution is given by a unitary transformation
U (t) = e−itH , |ψ(t) = U (t)|ψ(0)
U (t) can instead be used to make a unitary transformation that puts
the time-dependence in the observables, removing it from the states, giving
something called the “Heisenberg picture.” This is done as follows:
|ψ(t) → |ψ(t)H = U −1 (t)|ψ(t) = |ψ(0), O → OH (t) = U −1 (t)OU (t)
where the “H” subscripts indicate the Heisenberg picture choice for the treatment of time-dependence. It can easily be seen that the physically observable
quantities given by eigenvalues and expectations values are identical in the
two pictures:
H ψ(t)|OH |ψ(t)H = ψ(t)|U (t)(U

−1

(t)OU (t))U −1 (t)|ψ(t) = ψ(t)|O|ψ(t)

In the Heisenberg picture, the dynamics is given by a diﬀerential equation
not for the states but for the operators. Recall from our discussion of the
adjoint representation (see equation 5.1) the formula

Y = O, X = iH
we ﬁnd

d
OH (t) = [iH, OH (t)] = i[H, OH (t)]
dt

and this equation determines the time evolution of the observables in the
Heisenberg picture.
Applying this to the case of the spin 12 system in a magnetic ﬁeld, and
taking for our observable S (the Sj , taken together as a column vector), we
ﬁnd
eg

SH (t) = i[H, SH (t)] = i

By equation 6.5 and the identiﬁcation there of vectors and 2 by 2 matrices,
the spin vector observable evolves in the Heisenberg picture by rotating about
the magnetic ﬁeld vector B with angular velocity ge|B|
2mc .

7.4 Complex projective space
There is a diﬀerent possible approach to characterizing states of a quantum
system with H = C2 . Multiplication of vectors in H by a nonzero complex
number does not change eigenvectors, eigenvalues, or expectation values, so
arguably has no physical eﬀect. Thus what is physically relevant is the quotient space (C2 − 0)/C∗ , which is constructed by taking all nonzero elements
of C2 and identifying those related by multiplication by a nonzero complex
number.
For some insight into this construction, consider ﬁrst the analog for real
numbers, where (R2 − 0)/R∗ can be thought of as the space of all lines in
the plane going through the origin.

Figure 7.1: The real projective line RP1 .

One sees that each such line hits the unit circle in two opposite points, so
this set could be parametrized by a semicircle, identifying the points at the
two ends. This space is given the name RP1 and called the “real projective
line.” In higher dimensions, the space of lines through the origin in Rn is
called RPn−1 and can be thought of as the unit sphere in Rn , with opposite
points identiﬁed (recall from section 6.2.3 that SO(3) can be identiﬁed with
RP3 ).
What we are interested in is the complex analog CP1 , which is quite a bit
harder to visualize since in real terms it is a space of two-dimensional planes
through the origin of a four-dimensional space. A standard way to choose
coordinates on CP1 is to associate to the vector
 
z1
∈ C2
z2
the complex number z1 /z2 . Overall multiplication by a complex number will
drop out in this ratio, so one gets diﬀerent values for the coordinate z1 /z2
for each diﬀerent coset element, and elements of CP1 correspond to points
on the complex plane. There is, however, one problem with this coordinate:
The point on the plane corresponding to

0

7 Rotations and the Spin 12 Particle in a Magnetic Field

does not have a well-deﬁned value: as one approaches this point one moves oﬀ
to inﬁnity in the complex plane. In some sense, the space CP1 is the complex
plane, but with a “point at inﬁnity” added.
CP1 is better thought of not as a plane together with a point, but as a
sphere (often called the “Riemann sphere”), with the relation to the plane
and the point at inﬁnity given by stereographic projection. Here, one creates
a one-to-one mapping by considering the lines that go from a point on the
sphere to the north pole of the sphere. Such lines will intersect the plane in a
point, and give a one-to-one mapping between points on the plane and points
on the sphere, except for the north pole. Now, the north pole can be identiﬁed
with the “point at inﬁnity,” and thus, the space CP1 can be identiﬁed with
the space S 2 . The picture looks like this

Digression. For another point of view on CP1 , one constructs the quotient
of C2 by complex scalars in two steps. Multiplication by a real scalar corresponds to a change in normalization of the state, and we will often use this
freedom to work with normalized states, those satisfying
ψ|ψ = z1 z 1 + z2 z 2 = 1
Such normalized states are unit-length vectors in C2 , which are given by
points on the unit sphere S 3 ⊂ R4 = C2 .
With such normalized states, one still must quotient out the action of multiplication by a phase, identifying elements of S 3 that diﬀer by multiplication
by eiθ . The set of these elements forms a new geometrical space, often written S 3 /U (1). This structure is called a “ﬁbering” of S 3 by circles (the action
by phase multiplication traces out non-intersecting circles) and is known
as the “Hopf ﬁbration.” Try an Internet search for various visualizations
of the geometrical structure involved, a surprising decomposition of threedimensional space (identifying points at inﬁnity to get S 3 ) into nonintersecting curves.

Such transformations are invertible if the determinant of the matrix is
nonzero, and one can show that these give conformal (angle-preserving) transformations of the complex plane known as “Möbius transformations.” In
chapter 40, we will see that this group action appears in the theory of special
relativity, where the action on the sphere can be understood as transformations acting on the space of light rays. When the matrix above is in SU (2)
(γ = −β, δ = α, αα + ββ = 1), it can be shown that the corresponding
transformation on the sphere is a rotation of the sphere in R3 , providing
another way to understand the nature of SU (2) = Spin(3) as the double
cover of the rotation group SO(3).

7.5 The Bloch sphere
For another point of view on the relation between the two-state system with
H = C2 and the geometry of the sphere (known to physicists as the “Bloch
sphere” description of states), the unit sphere S 2 ⊂ R3 can be mapped to
operators by
x→σ·x
For each point x ∈ S 2 , σ · x has eigenvalues ±1. Eigenvectors with eigenvalue
+1 are the solutions to the equation
σ · x|ψ = |ψ

(7.4)

and give a subspace C ⊂ H, giving another parametrization of the points in
CP(1). Note that one could equivalently consider the operators
Px =

1
(1 − σ · x)
2

and look at the space of solutions to
Px |ψ = 0
It can easily be checked that Px satisﬁes Px2 = Px and is a projection operator.

7.5

The Bloch sphere

99

For a more physical interpretation of this in terms of the spin operators,
one can multiply 7.4 by 12 and characterize the C ⊂ H corresponding to
x ∈ S 2 as the solutions to
S · x|ψ =

1
|ψ
2

Then, the north pole of the sphere is a “spin-up” state, and the south pole is
a “spin-down” state. Along the equator, one ﬁnds two points corresponding
to states with deﬁnite values for S1 , as well as two for states that have deﬁnite
values for S2 .

For later applications of the spin representation, we would like to make for
each x a choice of solution to equation 7.4, getting a map
u+ : x ∈ S 2 → |ψ = u+ (x) ∈ H = C2
such that
(σ · x)u+ (x) = u+ (x)

(7.5)

This equation determines u+ only up to multiplication by an x-dependent
scalar.

where θ, φ are standard spherical coordinates (which will be discussed in

u+ (x) is determined by setting it to be
at the north pole, and deﬁn0
ing it at other points x on the sphere by acting on it by the element Ω
which, acting on vectors by conjugation (as usual using the identiﬁcation
of vectors and complex matrices), would take an north pole to x.
• With the speciﬁc choices made, u+ (x) is discontinuous at the south pole,
where x3 = −1, and φ is not uniquely deﬁned. For topological reasons,
there cannot be a continuous choice of u+ (x) with unit length for all
x. In applications one generally will be computing quantities that are
independent of the speciﬁc choice of u+ (x), so the discontinuity (which
is choice-dependent) should not cause problems.
One can similarly pick a solution u− (x) to the equation
(σ · x)u− (x) = −u− (x)
for eigenvectors with eigenvalue −1, with a standard choice

7.5

The Bloch sphere

101

Digression. The association of a diﬀerent vector space C ⊂ H = C2 to each
point x by taking the solutions to equation 7.5 is an example of something
called a “vector bundle” over the sphere of x ∈ S 2 . A speciﬁc choice for
each x of a solution u+ (x) is called a “section” of the vector bundle. It can
be thought of as a sort of “twisted” complex-valued function on the sphere,
taking values not in the same C for each x as would a usual function, but in
copies of C that vary with x.
These copies of C move around in C2 in a topologically non-trivial way:
they cannot all be identiﬁed with each other in a continuous manner. The
vector bundle that appears here is perhaps the most fundamental example
of a topologically non-trivial vector bundle. A discontinuity such as that
found in the section u+ of equation 7.6 is required because of this topological
non-triviality. For a non-trivial bundle like this one, there cannot be continuous nonzero sections.
While the Bloch sphere provides a simple geometrical interpretation of
the states of the two-state system, it should be noted that this association of
points on the sphere with states does not at all preserve the notion of inner
product. For example, the north and south poles of the sphere correspond to
orthogonal vectors in H, but of course (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0, −1) are not at all
orthogonal as vectors in R3 .

7.6 For further reading
Just about every quantum mechanics textbook works out this example of a
spin 12 particle in a magnetic ﬁeld. For one example, see chapter 14 of [81].
For an inspirational discussion of spin and quantum mechanics, together with
more about the Bloch sphere, see chapter 22 of [65].

Chapter 8

Representations of SU (2)
and SO(3)

For the case of G = U (1), in chapter 2 we were able to classify all complex
irreducible representations by an element of Z and explicitly construct each
irreducible representation. We would like to do the same thing here for representations of SU (2) and SO(3). The end result will be that irreducible representations of SU (2) are classiﬁed by a nonnegative integer n = 0, 1, 2, 3, · · · ,
and have dimension n + 1, so we will (hoping for no confusion with the irreducible representations (πn , C) of U (1)) denote them (πn , Cn+1 ). For even
n, these will correspond to an irreducible representation ρn of SO(3) in the
sense that
πn = ρn ◦ Φ
but this will not be true for odd n. It is common in physics to label these
representations by s = n2 = 0, 12 , 1, · · · and call the representation labeled by
s the “spin s representation.” We already know the ﬁrst three examples:
• Spin 0: π0 or ρ0 is the trivial representation for SU (2) or SO(3). In
physics, this is sometimes called the “scalar representation.” Saying that
states transform under rotations as the scalar representation just means
that they are invariant under rotations.
• Spin 12 : Taking

π1 (g) = g ∈ SU (2) ⊂ U (2)

gives the deﬁning representation on C2 . This is the spinor representation
discussed in chapter 7. It does not correspond to a representation of
SO(3).
• Spin 1: Since SO(3) is a group of 3 by 3 matrices, it acts on vectors in R3 .
This is just the standard action on vectors by rotation. In other words,
the representation is (ρ2 , R3 ), with ρ2 the identity homomorphism

8 Representations of SU (2) and SO(3)

This is sometimes called the “vector representation,” and we saw in
chapter 6 that it is isomorphic to the adjoint representation.
Composing the homomorphisms Φ and ρ:
π2 = ρ ◦ Φ : SU (2) → SO(3) ⊂ GL(3, R)
gives a representation (π2 , R3 ) of SU (2), the adjoint representation.
Complexifying gives a representation on C3 , which in this case is just
the action with SO(3) matrices on complex column vectors, replacing
the real coordinates of vectors by complex coordinates.

8.1 Representations of SU (2):
classification
8.1.1 Weight decomposition
If we make a choice of a U (1) ⊂ SU (2), then given any representation (π, V ) of
SU (2) of dimension m, we get a representation (π|U (1) , V ) of U (1) by restriction to the U (1) subgroup. Since we know the classiﬁcation of irreducibles of
U (1), we know that
(π|U (1) , V ) = Cq1 ⊕ Cq2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Cqm
for some q1 , q2 , · · · , qm ∈ Z, where Cq denotes the one-dimensional representation of U (1) corresponding to the integer q (theorem 2.3). These qj are
called the “weights” of the representation V . They are exactly the same thing
discussed in chapter 2 as “charges,” but here we will favor the mathematician’s terminology since the U (1) here occurs in a context far removed from
that of electromagnetism and its electric charges.
Since our standard choice of coordinates (the Pauli matrices) picks out the
z-direction and diagonalizes the action of the U (1) subgroup corresponding
to rotation about this axis, this is the U (1) subgroup we will choose to deﬁne
the weights of the SU (2) representation V . This is the subgroup of elements
of SU (2) of the form

An important property of the set of integers qj is the following:
Theorem If q is in the set {qj }, so is −q.
Proof. Recall that if we diagonalize a unitary matrix, the diagonal entries are
the eigenvalues, but their order is undetermined: Acting by permutations on
these eigenvalues, we get diﬀerent diagonalizations of the same matrix. In the
case of SU (2), the matrix

and we see that π(P ) gives a change of basis of V such that the representation
matrices on the U (1) subgroup are as before, with θ → −θ. Changing θ → −θ
in the representation matrices is equivalent to changing the sign of the weights
qj . The elements of the set {qj } are independent of the basis, so the additional
symmetry under sign change implies that for each nonzero element in the set,
there is another one with the opposite sign.

Looking at our three examples so far, we see that, restricted to U (1), the
scalar or spin 0 representation of course is one-dimensional and of weight 0
(π0 , C) = C0
and the spin 12 representation decomposes into U (1) irreducibles of weights
−1, +1:
(π1 , C2 ) = C−1 ⊕ C+1
For the spin 1 representation, recall (theorem 6.1) that the double cover
homomorphism Φ takes

Acting with the SO(3) matrix above on C3 will give a unitary transformation
of C3 , which therefore is in the group U (3). One can show that the upper left
diagonal 2 by 2 block acts on C2 with weights −2, +2, whereas the bottom
right element acts trivially on the remaining part of C3 , which is a onedimensional representation of weight 0. So, restricted to U (1), the spin 1
representation decomposes as
(π2 , C3 ) = C−2 ⊕ C0 ⊕ C+2
Recall that the spin 1 representation of SU (2) is often called the “vector” representation, since it factors in this way through the representation of SO(3)
by rotations on three-dimensional vectors.

8.1.2 Lie algebra representations: raising
and lowering operators
To proceed further in characterizing a representation (π, V ) of SU (2), we
need to use not just the action of the chosen U (1) subgroup, but the action
of group elements in the other two directions away from the identity. The
non-commutativity of the group keeps us from simultaneously diagonalizing
those actions and assigning weights to them. We can, however, work instead
with the corresponding Lie algebra representation (π  , V ) of su(2). As in
the U (1) case, the group representation is determined by the Lie algebra
representation. We will see that for the Lie algebra representation, we can
exploit the complexiﬁcation (recall section 5.5) sl(2, C) of su(2) to further
analyze the possible patterns of weights.
Recall that the Lie algebra su(2) can be thought of as the tangent space R3
to SU (2) at the identity element, with a basis given by the three skew-adjoint
2 by 2 matrices
1
Xj = −i σj
2
which satisfy the commutation relations
[X1 , X2 ] = X3 , [X2 , X3 ] = X1 , [X3 , X1 ] = X2
We will often use the self-adjoint versions Sj = iXj that satisfy
[S1 , S2 ] = iS3 , [S2 , S3 ] = iS1 , [S3 , S1 ] = iS2

A unitary representation (π, V ) of SU (2) of dimension m is given by a homomorphism
π : SU (2) → U (m)
We can take the derivative of this to get a map between the tangent spaces
of SU (2) and of U (m), at the identity of both groups, and thus a Lie algebra
representation
π  : su(2) → u(m)
which takes skew-adjoint 2 by 2 matrices to skew-adjoint m by m matrices,
preserving the commutation relations.
We have seen in section 8.1.1 that restricting the representation (π, V ) to
the diagonal U (1) subgroup of SU (2) and decomposing into irreducibles tells
us that we can choose a basis of V so that
(π, V ) = (πq1 , C) ⊕ (πq2 , C) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (πqm , C)

Recall that π  is a real linear map from a real vector space (su(2) = R3 )
to another real vector space (u(n), the skew-Hermitian m by m complex
matrices). As discussed in section 5.5, we can use complex linearity to extend

8 Representations of SU (2) and SO(3)

108

any such map to a complex linear map from su(2)C (the complexiﬁcation of
su(2)) to u(m)C (the complexiﬁcation of u(m)). Since su(2) ∩ isu(2) = 0 and
any element of sl(2, C) be written as a complex number times an element of
su(2), we have
su(2)C = su(2) + isu(2) = sl(2, C)
Similarly,
u(m)C = u(m) + iu(m) = M (m, C) = gl(m, C)
As an example, multiplying X = i2S3 ∈ su(2) by − 2i , we have S3 ∈ sl(2, C)
and the diagonal elements in the matrix π  (i2S3 ) get also multiplied by − 2i
(since π  is now a complex linear map), giving

We see that π  (S3 ) will have half-integral eigenvalues, and make the
following deﬁnitions:
Definition (Weights and Weight Spaces). If π  (S3 ) has an eigenvalue k2 , we
say that k is a weight of the representation (π, V ).
The subspace Vk ⊂ V of the representation V satisfying
v ∈ Vk =⇒ π  (S3 )v =

k
v
2

is called the kth weight space of the representation. All vectors in it are eigenvectors of π  (S3 ) with eigenvalue k2 .
The dimension dim Vk is called the multiplicity of the weight k in the
representation (π, V ).
S1 and S2 do not commute with S3 , so they will not preserve the subspaces
Vk and we cannot diagonalize them simultaneously with S3 . We can, however,
exploit the fact that we are in the complexiﬁcation sl(2, C) to construct two
complex linear combinations of S1 and S2 that do something interesting:

We have S+ , S− ∈ sl(2, C). These are neither self-adjoint nor skew-adjoint,
but satisfy
(S± )† = S∓
and similarly, we have

π  (S± )† = π  (S∓ )

We call π  (S+ ) a “raising operator” for the representation (π, V ), and π  (S− )
a “lowering operator.”
The reason for this terminology is the following calculation:
[S3 , S+ ] = [S3 , S1 + iS2 ] = iS2 + i(−iS1 ) = S1 + iS2 = S+
which implies (since π  is a Lie algebra homomorphism)
π  (S3 )π  (S+ ) − π  (S+ )π  (S3 ) = π  ([S3 , S+ ]) = π  (S+ )
For any v ∈ Vk , we have
π  (S3 )π  (S+ )v = π  (S+ )π  (S3 )v + π  (S+ )v = (
so

k
+ 1)π  (S+ )v

v ∈ Vk =⇒ π  (S+ )v ∈ Vk+2

The linear operator π  (S+ ) takes vectors with a well-deﬁned weight to vectors
with the same weight, plus 2 (thus the terminology “raising operator”). A
similar calculation shows that π  (S− ) takes Vk to Vk−2 , lowering the weight
by 2.
We are now ready to classify all ﬁnite dimensional irreducible unitary
representations (π, V ) of SU (2). We deﬁne:
Definition (Highest weights and highest weight vectors). A nonzero vector
v ∈ Vn ⊂ V such that
π  (S+ )v = 0
is called a highest weight vector, with highest weight n.
Irreducible representations will be characterized by a highest weight vector, as follows
Theorem (Highest weight theorem). Finite dimensional irreducible representations of SU (2) have weights of the form
−n, −n + 2, · · · , n − 2, n
for n a nonnegative integer, each with multiplicity 1, with n a highest weight.

110

8 Representations of SU (2) and SO(3)

Proof. Finite dimensionality implies there is a highest weight n, and we can
choose any highest weight vector vn ∈ Vn . Repeatedly applying π  (S− ) to vn
will give new vectors
vn−2j = π  (S− )j vn ∈ Vn−2j
with weights n − 2j.
Consider the span of the vn−2j , j ≥ 0. To show that this is a representation
one needs to show that the π  (S3 ) and π  (S+ ) leave it invariant. For π  (S3 ),
this is obvious; for π  (S+ ), one can show that
π  (S+ )vn−2j = j(n − j + 1)vn−2(j−1)

(8.1)

by an induction argument. For j = 0, this is the highest weight condition on
vn . Assuming validity for j, validity for j + 1 can be checked by
π  (S+ )vn−2(j+1) =π  (S+ )π  (S− )vn−2j
=(π  ([S+ , S− ]) + π  (S− )π  (S+ ))vn−2j
=(π  (2S3 ) + π  (S− )π  (S+ ))vn−2j
=((n − 2j)vn−2j + π  (S− )j(n − j + 1)vn−2(j−1)
=((n − 2j) + j(n − j + 1))vn−2j
=(j + 1)(n − (j + 1) + 1)vn−2((j+1)−1)
where we have used the commutation relation
[S+ , S− ] = 2S3
By ﬁnite dimensionality, there must be some integer k such that vn−2j = 0
for j ≤ k, and vn−2j = 0 for j = k + 1. But then, for j = k + 1, we must have
π  (S+ )vn−2j = 0
By equation 8.1, this will happen only for k + 1 = n + 1 (and we need to take
n positive). We thus see that v−n will be a “lowest weight vector,” annihilated
by π  (S− ). As expected, the pattern of weights is invariant under change of
sign, with nonzero weight spaces for
−n, −n + 2, · · · , n − 2, n

Digression Dropping the requirement of ﬁnite dimensionality, the same construction starting with a highest weight vector and repeatedly applying the
lowering operator can be used to produce inﬁnite dimensional irreducible

8.1

Representations of SU (2): classification

111

representations of the Lie algebras su(2) or sl(2, C). These occur when the
highest weight is not a nonnegative integer, and they will be non-integrable
representations (representations of the Lie algebra, but not of the Lie group).
Since we saw in section 8.1.1 that representations can be studied by looking
at the set of their weights under the action of our chosen U (1) ⊂ SU (2), we
can label irreducible representations of SU (2) by a nonnegative integer n,
the highest weight. Such a representation will be of dimension n + 1, with
weights
−n, −n + 2, · · · , n − 2, n
Each weight occurs with multiplicity one, and we have
(π|U (1) , V ) = C−n ⊕ C−n+2 ⊕ · · · Cn−2 ⊕ Cn
Starting with a highest weight or lowest weight vector, a basis for the
representation can be generated by repeatedly applying lowering or raising
operators. The picture to keep in mind is this

where all the vector spaces are copies of C, and all the maps are isomorphisms

In summary, we see that all irreducible ﬁnite dimensional unitary SU (2)
representations can be labeled by a nonnegative integer, the highest weight
n. These representations have dimension n + 1, and we will denote them
(πn , V n = Cn+1 ). Note that Vn is the nth weight space, V n is the representation with highest weight n. The physicist’s terminology for this uses not n,
but n2 and calls this number the “spin” of the representation. We have so far
seen the lowest three examples n = 0, 1, 2, or spin s = n2 = 0, 12 , 1, but there
is an inﬁnite class of larger irreducibles, with dim Vn = n + 1 = 2s + 1.

8.2 Representations of SU (2): construction
The argument of the previous section only tells us what properties possible
ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations of SU (2) must have. It shows
how to construct such representations given a highest weight vector, but does
not provide any way to construct such highest weight vectors. We would like
to ﬁnd some method to explicitly construct an irreducible (πn , V n ) for each
highest weight n. There are several possible constructions, but perhaps the
simplest one is the following, which gives a representation of highest weight n
by looking at polynomials in two complex variables, homogeneous of degree
n. This construction will produce representations not just of SU (2), but of
the larger group GL(2, C).
Recall from equation 1.3 that if one has an action of a group on a space
M , one can get a representation on functions f on M by taking
(π(g)f )(x) = f (g −1 · x)
For the group GL(2, C), we have an obvious action on M = C2 (by matrices
acting on column vectors), and we look at a speciﬁc class of functions on this
space, the polynomials. We can break up the inﬁnite dimensional space of
polynomials on C2 into ﬁnite dimensional subspaces as follows:
Definition (Homogeneous polynomials). The complex vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree n in two complex variables z1 , z2 is the space
of functions on C2 of the form
f (z1 , z2 ) = a0 z1n + a1 z1n−1 z2 + · · · + an−1 z1 z2n−1 + an z2n
The space of such functions is a complex vector space of dimension n + 1.
It turns out that this space of functions is exactly the representation space
V n that we need to get the irreducible representations of SU (2) ⊂ GL(2, C).
If we take


The representation πn (g) on homogeneous polynomial functions will be
given by replacing
z1 → αz1 + γz2 , z2 → βz1 + δz2

8 Representations of SU (2) and SO(3)

114

An important thing to note here is that the formulas we have found for πn
are not in terms of matrices. Instead, we have seen that when we construct
our representations using functions on C2 , for any X ∈ gl(2, C)), πn (X) is
given by a diﬀerential operator. These diﬀerential operators are independent
of n, with the same operator π  (X) on all the V n . This is because the original
deﬁnition of the representation
(π(g)f )(x) = f (g −1 · x)
is on the full inﬁnite dimensional space of polynomials on C2 . While this
space is inﬁnite dimensional, issues of analysis do not really come into play
here, since polynomial functions are essentially an algebraic construction.
Restricting the diﬀerential operators π  (X) to V n , the homogeneous polynomials of degree n, they become linear operators on a ﬁnite dimensional
space. We now have an explicit highest weight vector, and an explicit construction of the corresponding irreducible representation. If one chooses a
basis of V n , then the linear operator π  (X) will be given by a n + 1 by n + 1
matrix. Clearly though, the expression as a simple ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator is much easier to work with. In the examples we will be studying in later
chapters, the representations under consideration will often be on function
spaces, with Lie algebra representations appearing as diﬀerential operators.
Instead of using linear algebra techniques to ﬁnd eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the eigenvector equation will be a partial diﬀerential equation, with
our focus on using Lie groups and their representation theory to solve such
equations.
One issue we have not addressed yet is that of unitarity of the representation. We need Hermitian inner products on the spaces V n , inner products
that will be preserved by the action of SU (2) that we have deﬁned on these
spaces. A standard way to deﬁne a Hermitian inner product on functions on a
space M is to deﬁne them using an integral: for f, g complex-valued functions
on M , take their inner product to be
fg

f, g =
M

While for M = C2 this gives an SU (2) invariant inner product on functions
(one that is not invariant for the full group GL(2, C)), it is useless for f, g
polynomial, since such integrals diverge. In this case, an inner product on
polynomial functions on C2 can be deﬁned by
f, g =

1
π2

2

C2

2

f (z1 , z2 )g(z1 , z2 )e−(|z1 | +|z2 | ) dx1 dy1 dx2 dy2

(8.2)

Here, z1 = x1 + iy1 , z2 = x2 + iy2 . Integrals of this kind can be done fairly
easily since they factorize into separate integrals over z1 and z2 , each of which

can be treated using polar coordinates and standard calculus methods. One
can check by explicit computation that the polynomials
zj zk
√1 2
j!k!
will be an orthonormal basis of the space of polynomial functions with
respect to this inner product, and the operators π  (X), X ∈ su(2) will be
skew-adjoint.

representations, one ﬁnds orthonormal bases for the representation spaces V n

8.3 Representations of SO(3)
and spherical harmonics
We would like to now use the classiﬁcation and construction of representations of SU (2) to study the representations of the closely related group
SO(3). For any representation (ρ, V ) of SO(3), we can use the double covering homomorphism Φ : SU (2) → SO(3) to get a representation
π =ρ◦Φ
of SU (2). It can be shown that if ρ is irreducible, π will be too, so we must
have π = ρ ◦ Φ = πn , one of the irreducible representations of SU (2) found
in the last section. Using the fact that Φ(−1) = 1, we see that
πn (−1) = ρ ◦ Φ(−1) = 1

which will only be true for n even, not for n odd. Since the Lie algebra
of SO(3) is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of SU (2), the same Lie algebra
argument using raising and lowering operators as in the last section also
applies. The irreducible representations of SO(3) will be (ρl , V = C2l+1 ) for
l = 0, 1, 2, · · · , of dimension 2l + 1 and satisfying
ρl ◦ Φ = π2l
Just like in the case of SU (2), we can explicitly construct these representations using functions on a space with an SO(3) action. The obvious space
to choose is R3 , with SO(3) matrices acting on x ∈ R3 as column vectors.
The induced representation is as usual
(ρ(g)f )(x) = f (g −1 x)

Digression. A Note on Conventions
We are using the notation lj for the real basis of the Lie algebra so(3) =
su(2). For a unitary representation ρ, the ρ (lj ) will be skew-adjoint linear
operators. For consistency with the physics literature, we will use the notation
Lj = iρ (lj ) for the self-adjoint version of the linear operator corresponding
to lj in this representation on functions. The Lj satisfy the commutation
relations
[L1 , L2 ] = iL3 , [L2 , L3 ] = iL1 , [L3 , L1 ] = iL2
We will also use elements l± = l1 ± il2 of the complexiﬁed Lie algebra to
create raising and lowering operators L± = iρ (l± ).
As with the SU (2) case, we will not include a factor of  as is usual in
physics (the usual convention is Lj = iρ (lj )), since for considerations of the
action of the rotation group it would cancel out (physicists deﬁne rotations
i
using e  θLj ). The factor of  is only of signiﬁcance when Lj is expressed in
terms of the momentum operator, a topic discussed in chapter 19.
In the SU (2) case, the π  (Sj ) had half-integral eigenvalues, with the eigenvalues of π  (2S3 ) the integral weights of the representation. Here, the Lj will
have integer eigenvalues, the weights will be the eigenvalues of 2L3 , which
will be even integers.

The space of all functions on R3 is much too big: It will give us an inﬁnity
of copies of each ﬁnite dimensional representation that we want. Notice that
when SO(3) acts on R3 , it leaves the distance to the origin invariant. If we
work in spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) (see picture),

we will have
x1 =r sin θ cos φ
x2 =r sin θ sin φ
x3 =r cos θ
Acting on f (r, φ, θ), SO(3) will leave r invariant, only acting non-trivially on
θ, φ. It turns out that we can cut down the space of functions to something

8.3

that will only contain one copy of the representation we want in various ways.
One way to do this is to restrict our functions to the unit sphere, i.e., look at
functions f (θ, φ). We will see that the representations we are looking for can
be found in simple trigonometric functions of these two angular variables.
We can construct our irreducible representations ρl by explicitly constructing a function we will call Yll (θ, φ) that will be a highest weight vector of
weight l. The weight l condition and the highest weight condition give two
diﬀerential equations for Yll (θ, φ):
L3 Yll = lYll , L+ Yll = 0
These will turn out to have a unique solution (up to scalars).
We ﬁrst need to change coordinates from rectangular to spherical in our
expressions for L3 , L± . Using the chain rule to compute expressions like

Now that we have expressions for the action of the Lie algebra on functions
in spherical coordinates, our two diﬀerential equations saying our function

The functions Ylm (θ, φ) are called “spherical harmonics,” and they span
the space of complex functions on the sphere in much the same way that the
einθ span the space of complex-valued functions on the circle. Unlike the case

8.3

of polynomials on C2 , for functions on the sphere, one gets ﬁnite numbers
by integrating such functions over the sphere. So an inner product on these
representations for which they are unitary can be deﬁned by simply setting

We will not try and show this here, but for the allowable values of l, m the
Ylm (θ, φ) are mutually orthogonal with respect to this inner product.
One can derive various general formulas for the Ylm (θ, φ) in terms of Legendre polynomials, but here we will just compute the ﬁrst few examples, with
the proper constants that give them norm 1 with respect to the chosen inner
product.

We will see in chapter 21 that these functions of the angular variables in
spherical coordinates are exactly the functions that give the angular dependence of wavefunctions for the physical system of a particle in a spherically
symmetric potential. In such a case, the SO(3) symmetry of the system
implies that the state space (the wavefunctions) will provide a unitary representation π of SO(3), and the action of the Hamiltonian operator H will

122

8 Representations of SU (2) and SO(3)

commute with the action of the operators L3 , L± . As a result, all of the
states in an irreducible representation component of π will have the same
energy. States are thus organized into “orbitals,” with singlet states called
“s” orbitals (l = 0), triplet states called “p” orbitals (l = 1), multiplicity 5
states called “d” orbitals (l = 2), etc.

8.4 The Casimir operator
For both SU (2) and SO(3), we have found that all representations can be
constructed out of function spaces, with the Lie algebra acting as ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential operators. It turns out that there is also a very interesting secondorder diﬀerential operator that comes from these Lie algebra representations,
known as the Casimir operator. For the case of SO(3):
Definition (Casimir operator for SO(3)). The Casimir operator for the representation of SO(3) on functions on S 2 is the second-order diﬀerential operator
L2 ≡ L21 + L22 + L23
(the symbol L2 is not intended to mean that this is the square of an operator L)
A straightforward calculation using the commutation relations satisﬁed by
the Lj shows that
[L2 , ρ (X)] = 0
for any X ∈ so(3). Knowing this, a version of Schur’s lemma says that L2 will
act on an irreducible representation as a scalar (i.e., all vectors in the representation are eigenvectors of L2 , with the same eigenvalue). This eigenvalue
can be used to characterize the irreducible representation.
The easiest way to compute this eigenvalue turns out to be to act with
L2 on a highest weight vector. First one rewrites L2 in terms of raising and
lowering operators
L− L+ =(L1 − iL2 )(L1 + iL2 )
=L21 + L22 + i[L1 , L2 ]
=L21 + L22 − L3
so

L2 = L21 + L22 + L23 = L− L+ + L3 + L23

8.4

The Casimir operator

123

For the representation ρ of SO(3) on functions on S 2 constructed above,
we know that on a highest weight vector of the irreducible representation ρl
(restriction of ρ to the 2l + 1-dimensional irreducible subspace of functions
that are linear combinations of the Ylm (θ, φ)), we have the two eigenvalue
equations
L+ f = 0, L3 f = lf
with solution the functions proportional to Yll (θ, φ). Just from these conditions and our expression for L2 , we can immediately ﬁnd the scalar eigenvalue
of L2 since
L2 f = L− L+ f + (L3 + L23 )f = (0 + l + l2 )f = l(l + 1)f
We have thus shown that our irreducible representation ρl can be characterized as the representation on which L2 acts by the scalar l(l + 1).
In summary, we have two diﬀerent sets of partial diﬀerential equations
whose solutions provide a highest weight vector for and thus determine the
irreducible representation ρl :
•
L+ f = 0, L3 f = lf
which are ﬁrst-order equations, with the ﬁrst using complexiﬁcation and
something like a Cauchy–Riemann equation, and
•

L2 f = l(l + 1)f, L3 f = lf
where the ﬁrst equation is a second-order equation, something like a
Laplace equation.

That a solution of the ﬁrst set of equations gives a solution of the second
set is obvious. Much harder to show is that a solution of the second set gives
a solution of the ﬁrst set. The space of solutions to
L2 f = l(l + 1)f
for l a nonnegative integer includes as we have seen the 2l + 1-dimensional
vector space of linear combinations of the Ylm (θ, φ) (there are no other solutions, although we will not show that). Since the action of SO(3) on functions
commutes with the operator L2 , this 2l + 1-dimensional space will provide a
representation, the irreducible one of spin l.
The second-order diﬀerential operator L2 in the ρ representation on functions can explicitly be computed. It is

We will re-encounter this operator in chapter 21 as the angular part of the
Laplaceoperator on R3 .
For the group SU (2), we can also ﬁnd irreducible representations as solution spaces of diﬀerential equations on functions on C2 . In that case, the
diﬀerential equation point of view is much less useful, since the solutions we
are looking for are just the homogeneous polynomials, which are more easily
studied by purely algebraic methods.

8.5 For further reading
The classiﬁcation of SU (2) representations is a standard topic in all textbooks
that deal with Lie group representations. A good example is [40], which covers
this material well, and from which the discussion here of the construction of
representations as homogeneous polynomials is drawn (see pages 77-79). The
calculation of the Lj and the derivation of expressions for spherical harmonics as Lie algebra representations of so(3) appears in most quantum mechanics textbooks in one form or another (e.g., see chapter 12 of [81]). Another
source used here for the explicit constructions of representations is [20],
chapters 27-30.
A conventional topic in books on representation theory in physics is that of
the representation theory of the group SU (3), or even of SU (n) for arbitrary
n. The case n = 3 is of great historical importance, because of its use in the
classiﬁcation and study of strongly interacting particles, The success of these
methods is now understood as due to an approximate SU (3) symmetry of
the strong interaction theory corresponding to the existence of three diﬀerent
light quarks. The highest weight theory of SU (2) representations can be generalized to the case of SU (n), as well as to ﬁnite dimensional representations
of other Lie groups. We will not try and cover this topic here since it is a
bit intricate and is already very well described in many textbooks aimed at
mathematicians (e.g., [42]) and at physicists (e.g., [32]).

Tensor Products, Entanglement,
and Addition of Spin

If one has two independent quantum systems, with state spaces H1 and H2 ,
the combined quantum system has a description that exploits the mathematical notion of a “tensor product,” with the combined state space the
tensor product H1 ⊗ H2 . Because of the ability to take linear combinations
of states, this combined state space will contain much more than just products of independent states, including states that are described as “entangled”
and responsible for some of the most counterintuitive behavior of quantum
physical systems.
This same tensor product construction is a basic one in representation
theory, allowing one to construct a new representation (πW1 ⊗W2 , W1 ⊗ W2 )
out of representations (πW1 , W1 ) and (πW2 , W2 ). When we take the tensor
product of states corresponding to two irreducible representations of SU (2)
of spins s1 , s2 , we will get a new representation (πV 2s1 ⊗V 2s2 , V 2s1 ⊗ V 2s2 ). It
will be reducible, a direct sum of representations of various spins, a situation
we will analyze in detail.
Starting with a quantum system with state space H that describes a single
particle, a system of n particles can be described by taking an n-fold tensor
product H⊗n = H ⊗ H ⊗ · · · ⊗ H. It turns out that for identical particles,
we do not get the full tensor product space, but only the subspaces either
symmetric or antisymmetric under the action of the permutation group by
permutations of the factors, depending on whether our particles are “bosons”
or “fermions.” This is a separate postulate in quantum mechanics, but ﬁnds
an explanation when particles are treated as quanta of quantum ﬁelds.
Digression. When physicists refer to “tensors,” they generally mean the
“tensor fields” used in general relativity or other geometry-based parts of
physics, not tensor products of state spaces. A tensor field is a function on
a manifold, taking values in some tensor product of copies of the tangent
space and its dual space. The simplest tensor fields are vector fields, functions

taking values in the tangent space. A more non-trivial example is the metric
tensor, which takes values in the dual of the tensor product of two copies of
the tangent space.

9.1 Tensor products
Given two vector spaces V and W (over R or C), the direct sum vector
space V ⊕ W is constructed by taking pairs of elements (v, w) for v ∈ V, w ∈
W and giving them a vector space structure by the obvious addition and
multiplication by scalars. This space will have dimension
dim(V ⊕ W ) = dim V + dim W
If {e1 , e2 , . . . , edim V } is a basis of V , and {f1 , f2 , . . . , fdim W } a basis of W ,
the
{e1 , e2 , . . . , edim V , f1 , f2 , . . . , fdim W }
will be a basis of V ⊕ W .
A less trivial construction is the tensor product of the vector spaces V and
W . This will be a new vector space called V ⊗ W , of dimension
dim(V ⊗ W ) = (dim V )(dim W )
One way to motivate the tensor product is to think of vector spaces as vector
spaces of functions. Elements
v = v1 e1 + v2 e2 + · · · + vdim V edim V ∈ V
can be thought of as functions on the dim V points ej , taking values vj at
ej . If one takes functions on the union of the sets {ej } and {fk }, one gets
elements of V ⊕ W . The tensor product V ⊗ W will be what one gets by
taking all functions on not the union, but the product of the sets {ej } and
{fk }. This will be the set with (dim V )(dim W ) elements, which we will write
ej ⊗ fk , and elements of V ⊗ W will be functions on this set, or equivalently,
linear combinations of these basis vectors.
This sort of deﬁnition is less than satisfactory, since it is tied to an explicit
choice of bases for V and W . We will not, however, pursue more details of
this question or a better deﬁnition here. For this, one can consult pretty much
any advanced undergraduate text in abstract algebra, but here we will take
as given the following properties of the tensor product that we will need:
• Given vectors v ∈ V, w ∈ W , we get an element v⊗w ∈ V ⊗W , satisfying
bilinearity conditions (for c1 , c2 constants)

9.1

Tensor products

127

v ⊗ (c1 w1 + c2 w2 ) = c1 (v ⊗ w1 ) + c2 (v ⊗ w2 )
(c1 v1 + c2 v2 ) ⊗ w = c1 (v1 ⊗ w) + c2 (v2 ⊗ w)
• There are natural isomorphisms
V ⊗W W ⊗V
and
U ⊗ (V ⊗ W )  (U ⊗ V ) ⊗ W
for vector spaces U, V, W
• Given a linear operator A on V and another linear operator B on W ,
we can deﬁne a linear operator A ⊗ B on V ⊗ W by
(A ⊗ B)(v ⊗ w) = Av ⊗ Bw
for v ∈ V, w ∈ W .
With respect to the bases ej , fk of V and W , A will be a (dim V ) by
(dim V ) matrix, B will be a (dim W ) by (dim W ) matrix, and A ⊗ B will
be a (dim V )(dim W ) by (dim V )(dim W ) matrix (which can be thought
of as a (dim V ) by (dim V ) matrix of blocks of size (dim W )).
• One often wants to consider tensor products of vector spaces and dual
vector spaces. An important fact is that there is an isomorphism between
the tensor product V ∗ ⊗ W and linear maps from V to W . This is given
by identifying l ⊗ w (l ∈ V ∗ , w ∈ W ) with the linear map
v ∈ V → l(v)w ∈ W
• Given the motivation in terms of functions on a product of sets, for
function spaces in general we should have an identiﬁcation of the tensor product of function spaces with functions on the product set. For
instance, for square-integrable functions on R we expect
L2 (R) ⊗ L2 (R) ⊗ · · · ⊗ L2 (R) = L2 (Rn )

9.2 Composite quantum systems
and tensor products
Consider two quantum systems: one deﬁned by a state space H1 and a set
of operators O1 on it, and the second given by a state space H2 and set of
operators O2 . One can describe the composite quantum system corresponding
to considering the two quantum systems as a single one, with no interaction
between them, by taking as a new state space
HT = H1 ⊗ H2
with operators of the form
A ⊗ Id + Id ⊗ B
with A ∈ O1 , B ∈ O2 . The state space HT can be used to describe an
interacting quantum system, but with a more general class of operators.
If H is the state space of a quantum system, this can be thought of as
describing a single particle. Then, a system of N such particles is described
by the multiple tensor product
H⊗n = H ⊗ H ⊗ · · · ⊗ H ⊗ H

The symmetric group Sn acts on this state space, and one has a representation (π, H⊗n ) of Sn as follows. For σ ∈ Sn a permutation of the set
{1, 2, . . . , n} of n elements, on a tensor product of vectors one has
π(σ)(v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn ) = vσ(1) ⊗ vσ(2) ⊗ · · · ⊗ vσ(n)
The representation of Sn that this gives is in general reducible, containing
various components with diﬀerent irreducible representations of the group Sn .
A fundamental axiom of quantum mechanics is that if H⊗n describes n
identical particles, then all physical states occur as one-dimensional representations of Sn . These are either symmetric (“bosons”) or antisymmetric
(“fermions”) where:

Definition. A state v ∈ H⊗n is called

π(σ)v = v
The space of such states is denoted S n (H).
• antisymmetric, or fermionic if ∀σ ∈ Sn
π(σ)v = (−1)|σ| v
The space of such states is denoted Λn (H). Here, |σ| is the minimal
number of transpositions that by composition give σ.
Note that in the fermionic case, for σ a transposition interchanging two
particles, π acts on the factor H ⊗ H by interchanging vectors, taking

to itself for any vector w ∈ H. Antisymmetry requires that π takes this state
to its negative, so the state cannot be nonzero. As a result, one cannot have
nonzero states in H⊗n describing two identical particles in the same state
w ∈ H, a fact that is known as the “Pauli principle.”
While the symmetry or antisymmetry of states of multiple identical particles is a separate axiom when such particles are described in this way as tensor
products, we will see later on (chapter 36) that this phenomenon instead ﬁnds
a natural explanation when particles are described in terms of quantum ﬁelds.

9.3 Indecomposable vectors
and entanglement
If one is given a function f on a space X and a function g on a space Y , a
product function f g on the product space X × Y can be deﬁned by taking
(for x ∈ X, y ∈ Y )
(f g)(x, y) = f (x)g(y)
However, most functions on X × Y are not decomposable in this manner.
Similarly, for a tensor product of vector spaces:
Definition (Decomposable and indecomposable vectors). A vector in V ⊗W
is called decomposable if it is of the form v ⊗ w for some v ∈ V, w ∈ W . If it
cannot be put in this form, it is called indecomposable.

130

9 Tensor Products, Entanglement, and Addition of Spin

Note that our basis vectors of V ⊗ W are all decomposable since they are
products of basis vectors of V and W . Linear combinations of these basis
vectors, however, are in general indecomposable. If we think of an element
of V ⊗ W as a dim V by dim W matrix, with entries the coordinates with
respect to our basis vectors for V ⊗ W , then for decomposable vectors we get
a special class of matrices, those of rank one.
In the physics context, the language used is:
Definition (Entanglement). An indecomposable state in the tensor product
state space HT = H1 ⊗ H2 is called an entangled state.
The phenomenon of entanglement is responsible for some of the most surprising and subtle aspects of quantum mechanical systems. The Einstein–
Podolsky–Rosen paradox concerns the behavior of an entangled state of two
quantum systems, when one moves them far apart. Then performing a measurement on one system can give one information about what will happen if
one performs a measurement on the far-removed system, introducing a sort
of unexpected apparent non-locality.
Measurement theory itself involves crucially an entanglement between the
state of a system being measured, thought of as in a state space Hsystem , and
the state of the measurement apparatus, thought of as lying in a state space
Happaratus . The laws of quantum mechanics presumably apply to the total
system Hsystem ⊗ Happaratus , with the counterintuitive nature of measurements appearing due to this decomposition of the world into two entangled
parts: the one under study and a much larger for which only an approximate description in classical terms is possible. For much more about this, a
recommended reading is chapter 2 of [75].

9.4 Tensor products of representations
Given two representations of a group, a new representation can be deﬁned,
the tensor product representation, by:
Definition (Tensor product representation of a group). For (πV , V ) and
(πW , W ) representations of a group G, there is a tensor product representation (πV ⊗W , V ⊗ W ) defined by
(πV ⊗W (g))(v ⊗ w) = πV (g)v ⊗ πW (g)w
One can easily check that πV ⊗W is a homomorphism.
To see what happens for the corresponding Lie algebra representation,
compute (for X in the Lie algebra)

9.4.1 Tensor products of SU (2) representations
Given two representations (πV , V ) and (πW , W ) of a group G, we can decompose each into irreducibles. To do the same for the tensor product of the two
representations, we need to know how to decompose the tensor product of
two irreducibles. This is a fundamental and non-trivial question, with the
answer for G = SU (2) as follows:
Theorem 9.1 (Clebsch–Gordan decomposition).
The tensor product (πV n1 ⊗V n2 , V n1 ⊗V n2 ) decomposes into irreducibles as
(πn1 +n2 , V n1 +n2 ) ⊕ (πn1 +n2 −2 , V n1 +n2 −2 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (π|n1 −n2 | , V |n1 −n2 | )
Proof. One way to prove this result is to use highest weight theory, raising
and lowering operators, and the formula for the Casimir operator. We will not
try and show the details of how this works out, but in the next section give
a simpler argument using characters. However, in outline (for more details,
see, for instance, section 5.2 of [71]), here is how one could proceed:
One starts by noting that if vn1 ∈ Vn1 , vn2 ∈ Vn2 are highest weight vectors for the two representations, vn1 ⊗ vn2 will be a highest weight vector
in the tensor product representation (i.e., annihilated by πn 1 +n2 (S+ )), of
weight n1 + n2 . So (πn1 +n2 , V n1 +n2 ) will occur in the decomposition. Applying πn 1 +n2 (S− ) to vn1 ⊗ vn2 , one gets a basis of the rest of the vectors in
(πn1 +n2 , V n1 +n2 ). However, at weight n1 +n2 −2, one can ﬁnd another kind of
vector, a highest weight vector orthogonal to the vectors in (πn1 +n2 , V n1 +n2 ).
Applying the lowering operator to this gives (πn1 +n2 −2 , V n1 +n2 −2 ). As before,

132

9 Tensor Products, Entanglement, and Addition of Spin

at weight n1 + n2 − 4 one ﬁnds another, orthogonal highest weight vector,
and gets another representation, with this process only terminating at weight

|n1 − n2 |.

9.4.2 Characters of representations
A standard tool for dealing with representations is that of associating with
a representation an invariant called its character. This will be a conjugation
invariant function on the group that only depends on the equivalence class
of the representation. Given two representations constructed in very diﬀerent ways, it is often possible to check whether they are isomorphic by seeing
whether their character functions match. The problem of identifying the possible irreducible representations of a group can be attacked by analyzing the
possible character functions of irreducible representations. We will not try
and enter into the general theory of characters here, but will just see what
the characters of irreducible representations are for the case of G = SU (2).
These can be used to give a simple argument for the Clebsch–Gordan decomposition of the tensor product of SU (2) representations. For this, we do not
need general theorems about the relations of characters and representations,
but can directly check that the irreducible representations of SU (2) correspond to distinct character functions which are easily evaluated.
Definition (Character). The character of a representation (π, V ) of a group
G is the function on G given by
χV (g) = T r(π(g))
Since the trace of a matrix is invariant under conjugation, χV will be a
complex-valued, conjugation invariant function on G. One can easily check
that it will satisfy the relations
χV ⊕W = χV + χW , χV ⊗W = χV χW
For the case of G = SU (2), any element can be conjugated to be in the
U (1) subgroup of diagonal matrices. Knowing the weights of the irreducible
representations (πn , V n ) of SU (2), we know the characters to be the functions
χ

Theorem (Weyl character formula).

and equation 9.2 for the character.



To get a proof of 9.1, compute the character of the tensor product on
the diagonal matrices using the Weyl character formula for the second factor
(ordering things so that n2 > n1 )
χV n1 ⊗V n2 =χV n1 χV n2
ei(n2 +1)θ − e−i(n2 +1)θ

=(ein1 θ + ei(n1 −2)θ + · · · + e−i(n1 −2)θ + e−in1 θ )

So, when we decompose the tensor product of irreducibles into a direct sum
of irreducibles, the ones that must occur are exactly those of theorem 9.1.

9.4.3 Some examples
Some simple examples of how this works are:
• Tensor product of two spinors:
V1⊗V1 =V2⊕V0
This says that the four-complex dimensional tensor product of two
spinor representations (which are each two-complex dimensional) decomposes into irreducibles as the sum of a three-dimensional vector representation and a one-dimensional
trivial (scalar) representation.

One can show that this vector is invariant under SU (2), by computing
either the action of SU (2) or of its Lie algebra su(2). So, this vector
is a basis for the component V 0 in the decomposition of V 1 ⊗ V 1 into
irreducibles.

They are symmetric under permutation of the two factors of V 1 ⊗ V 1 .
We see that if we take two identical quantum systems with H = V 1 = C2
and make a composite system out of them, if they were bosons we would
get a three-dimensional state space V 2 = S 2 (V 1 ), transforming as a
vector (spin one) under SU (2). If they were fermions, we would get a
one-dimensional state space V 0 = Λ2 (V 1 ) of spin zero (invariant under
SU (2)). Note that in this second case, we automatically get an entangled
state, one that cannot be written as a decomposable product.
• Tensor product of three or more spinors:
V 1 ⊗ V 1 ⊗ V 1 = (V 2 ⊕ V 0 ) ⊗ V 1 = (V 2 ⊗ V 1 ) ⊕ (V 0 ⊗ V 1 ) = V 3 ⊕ V 1 ⊕ V 1

This says that the tensor product of three spinor representations decomposes as a four-dimensional (“spin 3/2”) representation plus two copies
of the spinor representation. This can be generalized by considering N fold tensor products (V 1 )⊗N of the spinor representation. This will be a
sum of irreducible representations, including one copy of the irreducible
V N , giving an alternative to the construction using homogeneous polynomials. Doing this, however, gives the irreducible as just one component
of something larger, and a method is needed to project out the desired
component. This can be done using the action of the symmetric group
SN on (V 1 )⊗N and an understanding of the irreducible representations
of SN . This relationship between irreducible representations of SU (2)
and those of SN coming from looking at how both groups act on (V 1 )⊗N

9.4

is known as “Schur-Weyl duality.” This generalizes to the case of SU (n)
for arbitrary n, where one can consider N -fold tensor products of the
deﬁning representation of SU (n) matrices on Cn . For SU (n), this provides perhaps the most straightforward construction of all irreducible
representations of the group.

9.5 Bilinear forms and tensor products
A diﬀerent sort of application of tensor products that will turn out to be
important is to the description of bilinear forms, which generalize the dual
space V ∗ of linear forms on V . We have:
Definition. (Bilinear forms). A bilinear form B on a vector space V over a
field k (for us, k = R or C) is a map
B : (v, v  ) ∈ V × V → B(v, v  ) ∈ k
that is bilinear in both entries, i.e.,
B(v + v  , v  ) = B(v, v  ) + B(v  , v  ), B(cv, v  ) = cB(v, v  )
B(v, v  + v  ) = B(v, v  ) + B(v, v  ), B(v, cv  ) = cB(v, v  )
where c ∈ k.
If B(v  , v) = B(v, v  ), the bilinear form is called symmetric; if B(v  , v) =
−B(v, v  ), it is antisymmetric.
The relation to tensor products is
Theorem 9.2. The space of bilinear forms on V is isomorphic to V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ .
Proof. The map
α1 ⊗ α2 ∈ V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ → B : B(v, v  ) = α1 (v)α2 (v  )
provides, in a basis-independent way, the isomorphism we are looking for.
One can show this is an isomorphism using a basis. Choosing a basis ej of
V , the coordinate functions vj = e∗j provide a basis of V ∗ , so the vj ⊗ vk
will be a basis of V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ . The map above takes linear combinations of these
to bilinear forms and is easily seen to be one-to-one and surjective for such
linear combinations.

Given a basis ej of V and dual basis vj of V ∗ (the coordinates), the element
of V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ corresponding to B can be written as the sum

This expresses the bilinear form B in terms of a matrix B with entries Bjk ,

9.6 Symmetric and antisymmetric
multilinear forms
The symmetric bilinear forms lie in S 2 (V ∗ ) ⊂ V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ and correspond to
symmetric matrices. Elements of V ∗ give linear functions on V , and one can
get quadratic functions on V from elements B ∈ S 2 (V ∗ ) by taking
v ∈ V → B(v, v) = v · Bv
Equivalently, in terms of tensor products, one gets quadratic functions as the
product of linear functions by taking
(α1 , α2 ) ∈ V ∗ × V ∗ →

1
(α1 ⊗ α2 + α2 ⊗ α1 ) ∈ S 2 (V ∗ )
2

and then evaluating at v ∈ V to get the number
1
(α1 (v)α2 (v) + α2 (v)α1 (v)) = α1 (v)α2 (v)
2
This multiplication can be extended to a product on the space
S ∗ (V ∗ ) = ⊕n S n (V ∗ )
(called the space of symmetric multilinear forms) by deﬁning
(α1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ αj )(αj+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ αn ) =P + (α1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ αn )

One can show that S ∗ (V ∗ ) with this product is isomorphic to the algebra
of polynomials on V . For a simple example of how this works, take vj ∈ V ∗ to
be the jth coordinate function. Then, the correspondence between monomials
in vj and elements of S ∗ (V ∗ ) is given by
vjn ↔ (vj ⊗ vj ⊗ · · · ⊗ vj )

n-times

Both sides can be thought of as the same function on V , given by evaluating
the jth coordinate of v ∈ V and multiplying it by itself n-times.
We will later ﬁnd useful the fact that S ∗ (V ∗ ) and (S ∗ (V ))∗ are isomorphic,
with the tensor product
(α1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ αj ) ∈ S ∗ (V ∗ )
corresponding to the linear map
ei1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ eij → α1 (ei1 ) · · · αj (eij )
Antisymmetric bilinear forms lie in Λ2 (V ∗ ) ⊂ V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ and correspond to
antisymmetric matrices. A multiplication (called the “wedge product”) can
be deﬁned on V ∗ that takes values in Λ2 (V ∗ ) by
(α1 , α2 ) ∈ V ∗ × V ∗ → α1 ∧ α2 =

1
(α1 ⊗ α2 − α2 ⊗ α1 ) ∈ Λ2 (V ∗ )
2

(9.5)

This multiplication can be extended to a product on the space
Λ∗ (V ∗ ) = ⊕n Λn (V ∗ )
(called the space of antisymmetric multilinear forms) by deﬁning
(α1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ αj ) ∧ (αj+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ αn ) =P − (α1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ αn )
1 
(−1)|σ| ασ(1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ ασ(n)

(9.6)
This can be used to get a product on the space of antisymmetric multilinear
forms of diﬀerent degrees, giving something in many ways analogous to the
algebra of polynomials (although without a notion of evaluation at a point
v). This plays a role in the description of fermions and will be considered
in more detail in chapter 30. Much like in the symmetric case, there is an
isomorphism between Λ∗ (V ∗ ) and (Λ∗ (V ))∗ .

Chapter 10

Momentum and the Free Particle

We will now turn to the problem that conventional quantum mechanics
courses generally begin with: that of the quantum system describing a free
particle moving in physical space R3 . This is something quite diﬀerent from
the classical mechanical description of a free particle, which will be reviewed
in chapter 14. A common way of motivating this is to begin with the 1924
suggestion by de Broglie that just as photons may behave like either particles
or waves, the same should be true for matter particles. Photons were known
to carry an energy given by E = ω, where ω is the angular frequency of
the wave. De Broglie’s proposal was that matter particles with momentum
p = k can also behave like a wave, with dependence on the spatial position
q given by
eik·q
This proposal was realized in Schrödinger’s early 1926 discovery of a version of quantum mechanics in which the state space is
H = L2 (R3 )
which is the space of square-integrable complex-valued functions on R3 , called
“wavefunctions.” The operator
P = −i∇
will have eigenvalues k, the de Broglie momentum, so it can be identiﬁed
as the momentum operator.
In this chapter, our discussion will emphasize the central role of the
momentum operator. This operator will have the same relationship to spatial
translations as the Hamiltonian operator does to time translations. In both
cases, the operators are the Lie algebra representation operators corresponding to a unitary representation on the quantum state space H of groups of

translations (translations in the three space and one time directions, respectively).
One way to motivate the quantum theory of a free particle is that whatever it is, it should have analogous behavior to that of the classical case
under translations in space and time. In chapter 14, we will see that in the
Hamiltonian form of classical mechanics, the components of the momentum
vector give a basis of the Lie algebra of the spatial translation group R3 , the
energy a basis of the Lie algebra of the time translation group R. Invoking

10.1 The group R and its representations
Some of the most fundamental symmetries of nature are translational symmetries, and the basic example of these involves the Lie group R, with the
group law given by addition. Note that R can be treated as a matrix group
with a multiplicative group law by identifying it with the group of matrices
of the form

with Lie bracket the matrix commutator (which is zero here). Such a Lie
algebra can be identiﬁed with the Lie algebra R (with trivial Lie bracket).
We will sometimes ﬁnd this way of expressing elements of R as matrices
useful, but will often instead label elements of the group by scalars a, and use
the additive group law. The same scalars a are also used to label elements
of the Lie algebra, with the exponential map from the Lie algebra to the
Lie group now just the identity map. Recall that the Lie algebra of a Lie
group can be thought of as the tangent space to the group at the identity.
For examples of Lie groups like R that are linear spaces, the space and its
tangent space can be identiﬁed, and this is what we are doing here.
The irreducible representations of the group R are the following:
Theorem 10.1. Irreducible representations of R are labeled by c ∈ C and
given by
πc (a) = eca
Such representations are unitary (in U (1)) when c is purely imaginary.
The proof of this theorem is the same as for the G = U (1) case (theorem
2.3), dropping the ﬁnal part of the argument, which shows that periodicity
(U (1) is just R with a and a + N 2π identiﬁed) requires c to be i times an
integer.
The representations of R that we are interested in are on spaces of wavefunctions, and thus inﬁnite dimensional. The simplest case is the representation induced on functions on R by the action of R on itself by translation.
Here, a ∈ R acts on q ∈ R (where q is a coordinate on R) by
q →a·q =q+a
and the induced representation π on functions (see equation 1.3) is
π(g)f (q) = f (g −1 · q)
which for this case will be
π(a)f (q) = f (q − a)

which is just Taylor’s formula.1
In chapter 5, for ﬁnite dimensional unitary representations of a Lie group
G, we found corresponding Lie algebra representations in terms of self-adjoint
matrices. For the case of G = R, even for inﬁnite dimensional representations
on H = L2 (R3 ), one gets an equivalence of unitary representations and selfadjoint operators,2 although now this is a non-trivial theorem in analysis, not
just a fact about matrices.

10.2 Translations in time and space
10.2.1 Energy and the group R of time translations
We have seen that it is a basic axiom of quantum mechanics that the observable operator responsible for inﬁnitesimal time translations is the Hamiltonian operator H, a fact that is expressed as the Schrödinger equation
i

d
|ψ = H|ψ
dt

When H is time-independent, this equation can be understood as reﬂecting
the existence of a unitary representation (U (t), H) of the group R of time
translations on the state space H.
When H is ﬁnite dimensional, the fact that a diﬀerentiable unitary representation U (t) of R on H is of the form
U (t) = e−  tH
i

1 This requires restricting attention to a specific class of functions for which the Taylor
series converges to the function.
2 For the case of H infinite dimensional, this is known as Stone’s theorem for one-parameter
unitary groups, see, for instance, section 10.2 of [41] for details.

10.2

Translations in time and space

143

for H a self-adjoint matrix follows from the same sort of argument as in
theorem 2.3. Such a U (t) provides solutions of the Schrödinger equation by
|ψ(t) = U (t)|ψ(0)
The Lie algebra of R is also R, and we get a Lie algebra representation of
R by taking the time derivative of U (t), which gives us


d
U (t)|t=0 = −iH
dt

Because this Lie algebra representation comes from taking the derivative of
a unitary representation, −iH will be skew-adjoint, so H will be self-adjoint.

10.2.2 Momentum and the group R3 of space
translations
Since we now want to describe quantum systems that depend not just on time,
but on space variables q = (q1 , q2 , q3 ), we will have an action by unitary
transformations of not just the group R of time translations, but also the
group R3 of spatial translations. We will deﬁne the corresponding Lie algebra
representations using self-adjoint operators P1 , P2 , P3 that play the same role
for spatial translations that the Hamiltonian plays for time translations:
Definition (Momentum operators). For a quantum system with state space
H = L2 (R3 ) given by complex-valued functions of position variables q1 , q2 , q3 ,
momentum operators P1 , P2 , P3 are defined by
P1 = −i

These are given the name “momentum operators” since we will see that
their eigenvalues have an interpretation as the components of the momentum
vector for the system, just as the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian have an
interpretation as the energy. Note that while in the case of the Hamiltonian,
the factor of  kept track of the relative normalization of energy and time
units; here, it plays the same role for momentum and length units. It can be
set to one if appropriate choices of units of momentum and length are made.
The diﬀerentiation operator is skew-adjoint since, using integration by
parts,3 one has for each variable, for ψ1 , ψ2 ∈ H
3 We are here neglecting questions of whether these integrals are well defined, which require
more care in specifying the class of functions involved.

case of the Hamiltonian (−iP = − dq
the conventional sign choice we have been using for the Hamiltonian makes
it minus the generator of translations in the time direction. The reason for
this comes from considerations of special relativity (which will be discussed
in chapter 40), where the inner product on space–time has opposite signs for
the space and time dimensions.

10.3 The energy–momentum relation
and the Schrödinger equation
for a free particle
We will review this subject in chapter 40, but for now we just need the relationship special relativity posits between energy and momentum. Space and
time are put together in “Minkowski space,” which is R4 with indeﬁnite inner
product
((u0 , u1 , u2 , u3 ), (v0 , v1 , v2 , v3 )) = −u0 v0 + u1 v1 + u2 v2 + u3 v3
Energy and momentum are the components of a Minkowski space vector
(p0 = E, p1 , p2 , p3 ) with norm-squared given by minus the mass-squared:

145

((E, p1 , p2 , p3 ), (E, p1 , p2 , p3 )) = −E 2 + |p|2 = −m2
This is the formula for a choice of space and time units such that the speed
of light is 1. Putting in factors of the speed of light c to get the units right,
one has
E 2 − |p|2 c2 = m2 c4
Two special cases of this are:
• For photons, m = 0, and one has the energy–momentum relation E =
|p|c
• For velocities v small compared to c (and thus momenta |p| small compared to mc), one has
E=

In the non-relativistic limit, we use this energy–momentum relation to
describe particles with velocities small compared to c, typically dropping
the momentum-independent constant term mc2 .
In later chapters, we will discuss quantum systems that describe photons,
as well as other possible ways of constructing quantum systems for relativistic
particles. For now though, we will just consider the non-relativistic case. To
describe a quantum non-relativistic particle, we choose a Hamiltonian operator H such that its eigenvalues (the energies) will be related to the momentum operator eigenvalues (the momenta) by the classical energy–momentum

it includes linear combinations of such states. At t = 0, the state can be a

10.4 For further reading
Every book about quantum mechanics covers this example of the free quantum particle somewhere very early on, in detail. Our discussion here is
unusual just in emphasizing the role of the spatial translation group and
its unitary representations.

Chapter 11

Fourier Analysis and the Free
Particle

The quantum theory of a free particle requires not just a state space H, but
also an inner product on H, which should be translation invariant so that
translations act as unitary transformations. Such an inner product will be
given by the integral

ψ1 (q)ψ2 (q)d3 q
ψ1 , ψ2  = C
R3

for some choice of normalization constant C, usually taken to be C = 1. H will
be the space L2 (R3 ) of square-integrable complex-valued functions on R3 .
A problem arises though if we try and compute the norm-squared of one
of our momentum eigenstates |k. We ﬁnd

k|k = C

R3

(e−ik·q )(eik·q )d3 q = C


R3

1 d3 q = ∞

As a result, there is no value of C which will give these states a ﬁnite norm,
and they are not in the expected state space. The ﬁnite dimensional spectral
theorem 4.1 assuring us that, given a self-adjoint operator, we can ﬁnd an
orthonormal basis of its eigenvectors, will no longer hold. Other problems
arise because our momentum operators Pj may take states in H to states
that are not in H (i.e., not square-integrable).
We will consider two diﬀerent ways of dealing with these problems, for
simplicity treating the case of just one spatial dimension. In the ﬁrst, we
impose periodic boundary conditions, eﬀectively turning space into a circle
of ﬁnite extent, leaving for later the issue of taking the size of the circle to
inﬁnity. The translation group action then becomes the U (1) group action
of rotation about the circle. This acts on the state space H = L2 (S 1 ), a
situation which can be analyzed using the theory of Fourier series. Momentum
eigenstates are now in H and labeled by an integer.

11 Fourier Analysis and the Free Particle

While this deals with the problem of eigenvectors not being in H, it ruins
an important geometrical structure of the free particle quantum system, by
treating positions (taking values in the circle) and momenta (taking values in
the integers) quite diﬀerently. In later chapters, we will see that physical systems like the free particle are best studied by treating positions and momenta
as real-valued coordinates on a single vector space, called phase space. To do
this, a formalism is needed that treats momenta as real-valued variables on
a par with position variables.
The theory of Fourier analysis provides the required formalism, with
the Fourier transform interchanging a state space L2 (R) of wavefunctions
depending on position with a unitarily equivalent one using wavefunctions
that depend on momenta. The problems of the domain of the momentum operator P and its eigenfunctions not being in L2 (R) still need to be
addressed. This can be done by introducing
• a space S(R) ⊂ L2 (R) of suﬃciently well-behaved functions on which
P is well deﬁned, and
• a space S  (R) ⊃ L2 (R) of “generalized functions,” also known as distributions, which will include the eigenvectors of P .
Solutions to the Schrödinger equation can be studied in any of the three
S(R) ⊂ L2 (R) ⊂ S  (R)
contexts, each of which will be preserved by the Fourier transform and allow
one to treat position and momentum variables on the same footing.

11.1 Periodic boundary conditions
and the group U (1)
In this section, we will describe one way to deal with the problems caused by
non-normalizable eigenstates, considering ﬁrst the simpliﬁed case of a single
spatial dimension. In this one-dimensional case, the space R is replaced by the
circle S 1 . This is equivalent to the physicist’s method of imposing “periodic
boundary conditions,” meaning to deﬁne the theory on an interval, and then
identify the ends of the interval. The position variable q can then be thought
of as an angle φ and one can deﬁne the inner product as

ψ1 (φ)ψ2 (φ)dφ

11.1

Periodic boundary conditions and the group U (1)

The state space is then

151

H = L2 (S 1 )

the space of complex-valued square-integrable functions on the circle.
Instead of the group R acting on itself by translations, we have the standard rotation action of the group SO(2) on the circle. Elements g(θ) of the
group are rotations of the circle counterclockwise by an angle θ, or if we
parametrize the circle by an angle φ, just shifts
φ→φ+θ
By the same argument as in the case G = R, we can use the representation
on functions given by equation 1.3 to get a representation on H
π(g(θ))ψ(φ) = ψ(φ − θ)
If X is a basis of the Lie algebra so(2) (for instance,
 taking
 the circle as
0
−1
, g(θ) = eθX ),
the unit circle in R2 , rotations 2 by 2 matrices, X =

then the Lie algebra representation is given by taking the derivative
π  (aX)f (φ) =

and provide a countable basis for the space L2 (S 1 ). This basis corresponds
to the decomposition into irreducibles of H as a representation of SO(2)
described above. One has
(π, L2 (S 1 )) = ⊕n∈Z (πn , C)

(11.2)

where πn are the irreducible one-dimensional representations given by the
multiplication action
πn (g(θ)) = einθ
The theory of Fourier series for functions on S 1 says that any function
ψ ∈ L2 (S 1 ) can be expanded in terms of this basis:
Theorem 11.1 (Fourier series). If ψ ∈ L2 (S 1 ), then

on the coeﬃcients cn .
One can easily derive the formula for cn using orthogonality of the |n. For
a detailed proof of the theorem, see, for instance, [27] and [83]. The theorem gives an equivalence (as complex vector spaces with a Hermitian inner
product) between square-integrable functions on S 1 and square-summable
functions on Z. As unitary SO(2) representations, this is the equivalence of
equation 11.2.
The Lie algebra of the group S 1 is the same as that of the additive group
R, and the π  (X) we have found for the S 1 action on functions is related to
the momentum operator in the same way as in the R case. So, we can use
the same momentum operator

To get something more realistic, we need to take our circle to have an arbitrary circumference L, and we can study our original problem with space R
by considering the limit L → ∞. To do this, we just need to change variables
from φ to φL , where

Note that these values are discrete (as long as the size L of the circle is ﬁnite)
and nonnegative.

11.2 The group R and the Fourier
transform
In the previous section, we imposed periodic boundary conditions, replacing
the group R of translations by the circle group S 1 , and then used the fact
that unitary representations of this group are labeled by integers. This made
the analysis relatively easy, with H = L2 (S 1 ) and the self-adjoint operator
∂
behaving much the same as in the ﬁnite dimensional case: The
P = −i ∂φ
eigenvectors of P give a countable orthonormal basis of H and P can be
thought of as an inﬁnite dimensional matrix.
Unfortunately, in order to understand many aspects of quantum mechanics, one cannot get away with this trick, but needs to work with R itself.
One reason for this is that the unitary representations of R are labeled by
the same group, R, and it will turn out (see the discussion of the Heisenberg group in Chapter 13) to be important to be able to exploit this and
treat positions and momenta on the same footing. What plays the role then
of |n = einφ , n ∈ Z will be the |k = eikq , k ∈ R. These are functions on
R that are one-dimensional irreducible representations under the translation
action on functions (as usual using equation 1.3)
π(a)eikq = eik(q−a) = e−ika eikq
One can try and mimic the Fourier series decomposition, with the coeﬃcients
cn that depend on the labels of the irreducibles replaced by a function f(k)
depending on the label k of the irreducible representation of R:

11.2

This integral is not well deﬁned for all elements of L2 (R), so one needs to
specify a subspace of L2 (R) to study for which it is well deﬁned, and then
extend the deﬁnition to L2 (R) by considering limits of sequences. In our case,
a good choice of such a subspace is the Schwartz space S(R) of functions ψ
such that the function and its derivatives fall oﬀ faster than any power at
inﬁnity. We will not try and give a more precise deﬁnition of S(R) here, but
a good class of examples of elements of S(R) to keep in mind are products
of polynomials and a Gaussian function. The Schwartz space has the useful
property that we can apply the momentum operator P an indeﬁnite number
of times without leaving the space.
Just as a function on S 1 can be recovered from its Fourier series coeﬃcients

of ψ, ψ itself can be
cn by taking a sum, given the Fourier transform ψ(k)
recovered by an integral, with the following theorem
Theorem (Fourier Inversion). For ψ ∈ S(R), one has ψ ∈ S(R) and

Note that F is the same linear operator as F, with a change in sign of the
argument of the function it is applied to. Note also that we are choosing one
of various popular ways of normalizing the deﬁnition of the Fourier transform.
In others, the factor of 2π may appear instead in the exponent of the complex
exponential, or just in one of F or F and not the other.
The operators F and F are thus inverses of each other on S(R). One has
Theorem (Plancherel). F and F extend to unitary isomorphisms of L2 (R)
with itself. In particular

A crucial property of the unitary operator F on H is that it diagonalizes the diﬀerentiation operator and thus the momentum operator P . Under
the Fourier transform, constant coeﬃcient diﬀerential operators become just
multiplication by a polynomial, giving a powerful technique for solving differential equations. Computing the Fourier transform of the diﬀerentiation
operator using integration by parts, we ﬁnd

So, under Fourier transform, diﬀerentiation by q becomes multiplication by

11.3 Distributions
While the use of the subspace S(R) ⊂ L2 (R) as state space gives a wellbehaved momentum operator P and a formalism symmetric between positions and momenta, it still has the problem that eigenfunctions of P are not
in the state space. Another problem is that unlike the case of L2 (R) where
the Riesz representation theorem provides an isomorphism between this space
and its dual just like in the ﬁnite dimensional case (see 4.3), such a duality
no longer holds for S(R).
For a space dual to S(R), one can take the space of linear functionals on
S(R) called the Schwartz space of tempered distributions (a certain continuity condition on the functionals is needed, see, for instance, [88]), which is
denoted by S  (R). An element of this space is a linear map
T : f ∈ S(R) → T [f ] ∈ C
S(R) can be identiﬁed with a subspace of S  (R), by taking ψ ∈ S(R) to the
linear functional Tψ given by
Tψ : f ∈ S(R) → Tψ [f ] =

 +∞
ψ(q)f (q)dq

(11.8)

−∞

Note that taking ψ ∈ S(R) to Tψ ∈ S  (R) is a complex linear map.
There are, however, elements of S  (R) that are not of this form, with three
important examples
• The linear functional that takes a function to its Fourier transform at
k:
f ∈ S(R) → f(k)

158

11 Fourier Analysis and the Free Particle

• The linear functional that takes a function to its value at q:
f ∈ S(R) → f (q)
• The linear functional that takes a function to the value of its derivative
at q:
f ∈ S(R) → f  (q)
We would like to think of these as “generalized functions,” corresponding to
Tψ given by the integral in equation 11.8, for some ψ which is a generalization
of a function.
From the formula 11.3 for the Fourier transform, we have
f(k) = T √1 e−ikq [f ]
2π

so the ﬁrst of the above linear functionals corresponds to
1
ψ(q) = √ e−ikq
2π
which is a function, but “generalized” in the sense that it is not in S(R)
(or even in L2 (R)). This is an eigenfunction for the operator P , and we see
that such eigenfunctions, while not in S(R) or L2 (R), do have a meaning as
elements of S  (R).
The second linear functional described above can be written as Tδ with the
corresponding generalized function the “δ-function,” denoted by the symbol
δ(q − q  ), which is taken to have the property that
 +∞

11.4 Linear transformations
and distributions
The deﬁnition of distributions as linear functionals on the vector space S(R)
means that for any linear transformation A acting on S(R), we can get a
linear transformation on S  (R) as the transpose of A (see equation 4.1),
which takes T to
At T : f ∈ S(R) → At [f ] = T [Af ] ∈ C

160

11 Fourier Analysis and the Free Particle

This gives a deﬁnition of the Fourier transform on S  (R) as
F t T [f ] ≡ T [Ff ]
and one can show that, as for S(R) and L2 (R), the Fourier transform provides
an isomorphism of S  (R) with itself. Identifying functions ψ with distributions Tψ , one has
F t Tψ [f ] ≡Tψ [Ff ]

Equation 11.7 shows that under Fourier transformation, the derivative operd
becomes the multiplication operator ik, and this property will extend

to distributions. The Fourier transform takes constant coeﬃcient diﬀerential
equations in q to polynomial equations in k, which can often much more

11 Fourier Analysis and the Free Particle

11.6 For further reading
The use of periodic boundary conditions, or “putting the system in a box,”
thus reducing the problem to that of Fourier series, is a conventional topic
in quantum mechanics textbooks. Two good sources for the mathematics of
Fourier series are [83] and [27]. The use of the Fourier transform to solve the
free particle Schrödinger equation is a standard topic in physics textbooks,
although the function space used is often not speciﬁed and distributions are
not explicitly deﬁned (although some discussion of the δ-function is always
present). Standard mathematics textbooks discussing the Fourier transform
and the theory of distributions are [88] and [27]. Lecture 6 in the notes on
physics by Dolgachev [18] contains a more mathematically careful discussion
of the sort of calculations with the δ-function described in this chapter and
common in the physics literature.
For some insight into, and examples of, the problems that can appear
when one ignores (as we generally do) the question of domains of operators
such as the momentum operator, see [34]. Section 2.1 of [90] or Chapter 10
of [41] provides a formalism that includes a spectral theorem for unbounded
self-adjoint operators, generalizing appropriately the spectral theorem of the
ﬁnite dimensional state space case.

Chapter 12

Position and the Free Particle

Our discussion of the free particle has so far been largely in terms of one
observable, the momentum operator. The free particle Hamiltonian is given
in terms of this operator (H = P 2 /2m), and we have seen in section 11.5
that solutions of the Schrödinger equation behave very simply in momentum
space. Since [P, H] = 0, momentum is a conserved quantity, and momentum
eigenstates will remain momentum eigenstates under time evolution.
The Fourier transform interchanges momentum and position space, and
a position operator Q can be deﬁned that will play the role of the Fourier
transform of the momentum operator. Position eigenstates will be position
space δ-functions, but [Q, H] = 0 and the position will not be a conserved
quantity. The time evolution of a state initially in a position eigenstate can
be calculated in terms of a quantity called the propagator, which we will
compute and study.

12.1 The position operator
On a state space H of functions (or distributions) of a position variable q,
one can deﬁne:
Definition (Position operator). The position operator Q is given by
Qψ(q) = qψ(q)
Note that this operator has similar problems of deﬁnition to those of the
momentum operator P : it can take a function in L2 (R) to one that is no
longer square-integrable. Like P , it is well deﬁned on the Schwartz space
S(R), as well as on the distributions S  (R). Also like P , it has no eigenfuncc Peter Woit 2017

tions in S(R) or L2 (R), but it does have eigenfunctions in S  (R). Since

qδ(q − q  )f (q)dq = q  f (q  ) =

 +∞

q  δ(q − q  )f (q)dq

one has the equality of distributions
qδ(q − q  ) = q  δ(q − q  )
so δ(q − q  ) is an eigenfunction of Q with eigenvalue q  .
The operators Q and P do not commute, since
[Q, P ]f = −iq

d
d
f + i (qf ) = if
dq
dq

and we get (reintroducing  for a moment) the fundamental operator commutation relation
[Q, P ] = i1
the Heisenberg commutation relation. This implies that Q and the free parti1
P 2 also do not commute, so the position, unlike the
cle Hamiltonian H = 2m
momentum, is not a conserved quantity.
For a ﬁnite dimensional state space, recall that the spectral theorem (4.1)
for a self-adjoint operator implied that any state could be written as a linear
combination of eigenvectors of the operator. In this inﬁnite dimensional case,
the formula
 +∞
δ(q − q  )ψ(q  )dq 

can be interpreted as an expansion of an arbitrary state in terms of a continuous linear combination of eigenvectors of Q with eigenvalue q  , the δ-functions
δ(q − q  ). The Fourier inversion formula (11.4)

12.2 Momentum space representation
We began our discussion of the state space H of a free particle by taking states
to be wavefunctions ψ(q) deﬁned on position space, thought of variously as

such functions to their Fourier transforms

2π −∞
in the same sort of function space, we saw in section 11.5 that the state space

H can instead be taken to be a space of functions ψ(k)
on momentum space.
We will call such a choice of H, with the operator P now acting as


P ψ(k)
= k ψ(k)
the momentum space representation, as opposed to the previous position
space representation. By the Plancherel theorem (11.2), these are unitarily
equivalent representations of the group R, which acts in the position space
case by translation by a in the position variable, in the momentum space case
by multiplication by a phase factor eika .
In the momentum space representation, the eigenfunctions of P are the
distributions δ(k − k  ), with eigenvalue k  , and the expansion of a state in
terms of eigenvectors is

12.3 Dirac notation
In the Dirac bra-ket formalism, position and momentum eigenstates will be
denoted |q and |k, respectively, with
Q|q = q|q,

P |k = k|k

Arbitrary states |ψ can be thought of as determined by coeﬃcients

q|ψ = ψ(q), k|ψ = ψ(k)

(12.3)

with respect to either the |q or |k basis. The use of the bra-ket formalism
requires some care, however, since states like |q or |k are elements of S  (R)
that do not correspond to any element of S(R). Given elements |ψ in S(R),
they can be paired with elements of S  (R) like q| and k| as in equation
12.3 to get numbers. When working with states like |q   and |k  , one has to
invoke and properly interpret distributional relations such as
q|q   = δ(q − q  ), k|k   = δ(k − k  )

12.4 Heisenberg uncertainty
We have seen that, describing the state of a free particle at a ﬁxed time, one
has δ-function states corresponding to a well-deﬁned position (in the position
representation) or a well-deﬁned momentum (in the momentum representation). But Q and P do not commute, and states with both well-deﬁned position and well-deﬁned momentum do not exist. An example of a state peaked
at q = 0 will be given by the Gaussian wavefunction
q2

ψ(q) = e−α 2

which becomes narrowly peaked for α large. By equation 11.6, the corresponding state in the momentum space representation is
k2
1
√ e− 2α
α

which becomes uniformly spread out as α gets large. Similarly, as α goes to
zero, one gets a state narrowly peaked at k = 0 in momentum space, but
uniformly spread out as a position space wavefunction.
For states with expectation value of Q and P equal to zero, the width
of the state in position space can be quantiﬁed by the expectation value of
Q2 , and its width in momentum space by the expectation value of P 2 . One
has the following theorem, which makes precise the limit on simultaneously
localizability of a state in position and momentum space

12.5 The propagator in position space
Free particle states with the simplest physical interpretation are momentum
eigenstates. They describe a single quantum particle with a ﬁxed momentum
k  , and this momentum is a conserved quantity that will not change. In the
momentum space representation (see section 11.5), such a time-dependent
state will be given by

p and angular frequency 2m .
As for any quantum system, time evolution of a free particle from time
0 to time t is given by a unitary operator U (t) = e−itH . In the momentum
space representation, this is just the multiplication operator
1

2

U (t) = e−i 2m k t
In the position space representation, it is given by an integral kernel called
the “propagator”:
Definition (Position space propagator) The position space propagator is
the kernel U (t, qt , q0 ) of the time evolution operator acting on position space
wavefunctions. It determines the time evolution of wavefunctions for all times
t by

To make sense of the integral 12.5, the product it can be replaced by
a complex variable z = τ + it. The integral becomes well deﬁned when τ =
Re(z) (“imaginary time”) is positive and then deﬁnes a holomorphic function
in z. Doing the integral by the same method as in equation 11.6, one ﬁnds

U (z = τ + it, qt − q0 ) =

m − m (qt −q0 )2

ψ(q, τ ) =

∂τ
2m ∂q 2
known as the “heat equation.” This equation models the way temperature
diﬀuses in a medium; it also models the way probability of a given position
diﬀuses in a random walk. Note that here it is ψ(q) that gives the probability density, something quite diﬀerent from the way probability occurs in
measurement theory for the free particle quantum system. There it is |ψ|2
that gives the probability density for the particle to have position observable
eigenvalue q.
Taking as initial condition
ψ(q0 , 0) = δ(q0 − q  )
the heat equation will have as solution at later times

ψ(qτ , τ ) =

m − m (q −qτ )2
e 2τ
2πτ

(12.8)

This is physically reasonable: at times τ > 0, an initial source of heat localized
at a point q  diﬀuses as a Gaussian about q  with increasing width. For τ < 0,
one gets something that grows exponentially at ±∞, and so is not in L2 (R)
or even S  (R).
In real time t as opposed to imaginary time τ (i.e., z = it, interpreted as
the limit lim→0+ ( + it)), equation 12.7 becomes

U (t, qt − q0 ) =

m − m (qt −q0 )2
e i2t
i2πt

(12.9)

Unlike the case of imaginary time, this expression needs to be interpreted as a
distribution, and as such equation 12.4 makes sense for ψ(q0 , 0) ∈ S(R). One
can show that, for ψ(q0 , 0) with amplitude peaked around a position q  and
with amplitude of its Fourier transform peaked around a momentum k  , at
later times ψ(q, t) will become less localized, but with a maximum amplitude

at q  + km t.

Near t = 0 this function has a rather peculiar behavior. It starts out localized
at q0 at t = 0, but at any later time t > 0, no matter how small, the wavefunction will have constant amplitude extending out to inﬁnity in position
space. Here one sees clearly the necessity of interpreting such a wavefunction
as a distribution.

12 Position and the Free Particle

For a physical interpretation of this calculation, note that while a momentum eigenstate is a good approximation to a stable state one can create and
then study, an approximate position eigenstate is quite diﬀerent. Its creation requires an interaction with an apparatus that exchanges a very large
momentum (involving a very short wavelength to resolve the position). By
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, a precisely known position corresponds
to a completely unknown momentum, which may be arbitrarily large. Such
arbitrarily large momenta imply arbitrarily large velocities, reaching arbitrarily far away in arbitrarily short time periods. In later chapters, we will see
how relativistic quantum theories provide a more physically realistic description of what happens when one attempts to localize a quantum particle, with
quite diﬀerent phenomena (including possible particle production) coming
into play.

12.6 Propagators in frequency–momentum
space
The propagator deﬁned by equation 12.4 will take a wavefunction at time 0
and give the wavefunction at any other time t, positive or negative. We will
ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a version of the propagator that takes into account
causality, only giving a nonzero result for t > 0:
Definition (Retarded propagator). The retarded propagator is given by


U+ (t, qt − q0 ) =
U (t, qt − q0 )

This can also be written
U+ (t, qt − q0 ) = θ(t)U (t, qt − q0 )
where θ(t) is the step-function

Digression. The integral 12.10 can also be computed using methods of complex analysis in the variable ω. Cauchy’s integral formula says that the integral
about a closed curve of a meromorphic function with simple poles is given by
2πi times the sum of the residues at the poles. For t < 0, since e−iωt falls oﬀ
exponentially if ω has a nonzero positive imaginary part, the integral along
the real ω axis will be the same as for the semi-circle C+ closed in the upper
half-plane (with the radius of the semi-circle taken to inﬁnity). C+ encloses
no poles so the integral is 0.

The topics of this chapter are covered in every quantum mechanics textbook,
with a discussion providing more physical motivation. For a mathematics
textbook that covers distributional solutions of the Schrödinger equation in
detail, see [72]. In the textbook [41] for mathematicians, see chapter 4 for
a more detailed mathematically rigorous treatment of the free particle and
chapter 12 for a careful treatment of the subtleties of Heisenberg uncertainty.

Chapter 13

The Heisenberg group
and the Schrödinger
Representation

In our discussion of the free particle, we used just the actions of the groups
R3 of spatial translations and the group R of time translations, ﬁnding corresponding observables, the self-adjoint momentum and Hamiltonian operators
P and H. We have seen though that the Fourier transform allows a perfectly
symmetrical treatment of position and momentum variables and the corresponding non-commuting position and momentum operators Qj and Pj .
The Pj and Qj operators satisfy relations known as the Heisenberg commutation relations, which ﬁrst appeared in the earliest work of Heisenberg and
collaborators on a full quantum-mechanical formalism in 1925. These were
quickly recognized by Hermann Weyl as the operator relations of a Lie algebra
representation, for a Lie algebra now known as the Heisenberg Lie algebra.
The corresponding group is called the Heisenberg group by mathematicians,
with physicists sometimes using the terminology “Weyl group” (which means
something else to mathematicians). The state space of a quantum particle,
either free or moving in a potential, will be a unitary representation of this
group, with the group of spatial translations a subgroup.
Note that this particular use of a group and its representation theory in
quantum mechanics is both at the core of the standard axioms and much more
general than the usual characterization of the signiﬁcance of groups as “symmetry groups.” The Heisenberg group does not in any sense correspond to a
group of invariances of the physical situation (there are no states invariant
under the group), and its action does not commute with any nonzero Hamiltonian operator. Instead it plays a much deeper role, with its unique unitary
representation determining much of the structure of quantum mechanics.

13 The Heisenberg group and the Schrödinger Representation

13.1 The Heisenberg Lie algebra
In either the position or momentum space representation, the operators Pj
and Qj satisfy the relation
[Qj , Pk ] = iδjk 1
Soon after this commutation relation appeared in early work on quantum
mechanics, Weyl realized that it can be interpreted as the relation between
operators one would get from a representation of a 2d + 1 dimensional Lie
algebra, now called the Heisenberg Lie algebra. Treating ﬁrst the d = 1 case,
we deﬁne:
Definition (Heisenberg Lie algebra, d = 1). The Heisenberg Lie algebra h3
is the vector space R3 with the Lie bracket defined by its values on a basis
(X, Y, Z) by
[X, Y ] = Z, [X, Z] = [Y, Z] = 0
Writing a general element of h3 in terms of this basis as xX + yY + zZ,
and grouping the x, y coordinates together (we will see that it is useful to
think of the vector space h3 as R2 ⊕ R), the Lie bracket is given in terms of
the coordinates by

Note that this is a non-trivial Lie algebra, but only minimally so. All Lie
brackets of Z with anything else are zero. All Lie brackets of Lie brackets are
also zero (as a result, this is an example of what is known as a “nilpotent”
Lie algebra).
The Heisenberg Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of 3 by 3
strictly upper triangular real matrices, with Lie bracket the matrix commutator, by the following isomorphism:

so the group with Lie algebra h3 will be the group of upper triangular 3 by
3 real matrices with 1 on the diagonal, and this group will be the Heisenberg group H3 . For our purposes though, it is better to work in exponential
coordinates (i.e., labeling a group element with the Lie algebra element that
exponentiates to it). In these coordinates, the exponential map relating the
Heisenberg Lie algebra h2d+1 and the Heisenberg Lie group H2d+1 is just the
identity map, and we will use the same notation

for both Lie algebra and corresponding Lie group elements.
Matrix exponentials in general satisfy the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀ formula, which says
1

1

1

eA eB = eA+B+ 2 [A,B]+ 12 [A,[A,B]]− 12 [B,[A,B]]+···
where the higher terms can all be expressed as repeated commutators. This
provides one way of showing that the Lie group structure is determined (for
group elements expressible as exponentials) by knowing the Lie bracket. For
the full formula and a detailed proof, see chapter 5 of [42]. One can easily
check the ﬁrst few terms in this formula by expanding the exponentials, but
the diﬃculty of the proof is that it is not at all obvious why all the terms
can be organized in terms of commutators.
For the case of the Heisenberg Lie algebra, since all multiple commutators
vanish, the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀ formula implies for exponentials of
elements of h3
1
eA eB = eA+B+ 2 [A,B]
(a proof of this special case of Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀ is in section 5.2
of [42]). We can use this to explicitly write the group law in exponential
coordinates:

Note that the Lie algebra basis elements X, Y, Z each generate subgroups
of H3 isomorphic to R. Elements of the ﬁrst two of these subgroups generate
the full group, and elements of the third subgroup are “central,” meaning
they commute with all group elements. Also notice that the non-commutative
nature of the Lie algebra (equation 13.1) or group (equation 13.2) depends
purely on the factor xy  − yx .

13.3 The Schrödinger representation
Since it can be deﬁned in terms of 3 by 3 matrices, the Heisenberg group H3
has an obvious representation on C3 , but this representation is not unitary
and not of physical interest. What is of great interest is the inﬁnite dimensional representation on functions of q for which the Lie algebra version is
given by the Q, P , and unit operators:
Definition (Schrödinger representation, Lie algebra version). The Schrödinger representation of the Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 is the representation
(ΓS , L2 (R)) satisfying

ΓS (Z)ψ(q) = −iψ(q)
Factors of i have been chosen to make these operators skew-adjoint and
the representation thus unitary. They can be exponentiated, giving in the

The group analog of the Heisenberg commutation relations (often called
the “Weyl form” of the commutation relations) is the relation
e−ixQ e−iyP = e−ixy e−iyP e−ixQ
This can be derived by using the explicit representation operators in equation
13.3 (or the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀ formula and the Heisenberg commutation relations) to compute
1

xy

e−ixQ e−iyP = e−i(xQ+yP )+ 2 [−ixQ,−iyP ] = e−i 2 e−i(xQ+yP )
as well as the same product in the opposite order, and then comparing the
results.

so the representation operators are periodic with period 2π in the
z-coordinate. Some authors choose to deﬁne the Heisenberg group H3 as
not R2 ⊕ R, but R2 × S 1 , building this periodicity automatically into the
deﬁnition of the group, rather than the representation.
We have seen that the Fourier transform F takes the Schrödinger representation to a unitarily equivalent representation of H3 , in terms of functions
of p (the momentum space representation). The equivalence is given by a
change
 S (g) = F ΓS (g)F
ΓS (g) → Γ

13.3

The Schrödinger representation

in the representation operators, with the Plancherel theorem (equation 11.5
ensuring that F and F = F −1 are unitary operators.
In typical physics quantum mechanics textbooks, one often sees calculations made just using the Heisenberg commutation relations, without picking
a speciﬁc representation of the operators that satisfy these relations. This
turns out to be justiﬁed by the remarkable fact that, for the Heisenberg
group, once one picks the constant with which Z acts, all irreducible representations are unitarily equivalent. By unitarity, this constant is −ic, c ∈ R.
We have chosen c = 1, but other values of c would correspond to diﬀerent
choices of units.
In a sense, the representation theory of the Heisenberg group is very simple: there’s only one irreducible representation. This is very diﬀerent from
the theory for even the simplest compact Lie groups (U (1) and SU (2)) which
have an inﬁnity of inequivalent irreducibles labeled by weight or by spin.
Representations of a Heisenberg group will appear in diﬀerent guises (we
have seen two and will see another in the discussion of the harmonic oscillator, and there are yet others that appear in the theory of theta-functions),
but they are all unitarily equivalent, a statement known as the Stone–von
Neumann theorem. Some good references for this material are [90] and [41].
In-depth discussions devoted to the mathematics of the Heisenberg group
and its representations can be found in [51], [26], and [94].
In these references can be found a proof of the (not diﬃcult)
Theorem. The Schrödinger representation ΓS described above is irreducible.
and the much more diﬃcult
Theorem (Stone–von Neumann). Any irreducible representation π of the
group H3 on a Hilbert space, satisfying
π  (Z) = −i1
is unitarily equivalent to the Schrödinger representation (ΓS , L2 (R)).
Note that all of this can easily be generalized to the case of d spatial
dimensions, for d ﬁnite, with the Heisenberg group now H2d+1 and the Stone–
von Neumann theorem still true. In the case of an inﬁnite number of degrees
of freedom, which is the case of interest in quantum ﬁeld theory, the Stone–
von Neumann theorem no longer holds and one has an inﬁnity of inequivalent
irreducible representations, leading to quite diﬀerent phenomena. For more
on this topic, see chapter 39.
It is also important to note that the Stone–von Neumann theorem is formulated for Heisenberg group representations, not for Heisenberg Lie algebra
representations. For inﬁnite dimensional representations in cases like this,
there are representations of the Lie algebra that are “non-integrable”: they
are not the derivatives of Lie group representations. For such non-integrable
representations of the Heisenberg Lie algebra (i.e., operators satisfying the

188

Heisenberg commutation relations), there are counter-examples to the analog
of the Stone–von Neumann theorem. It is only for integrable representations
that the theorem holds, and one has a unique sort of irreducible representation.

13.4 For further reading
For a lot more detail about the mathematics of the Heisenberg group, its
Lie algebra and the Schrödinger representation, see [8], [51], [26], and [94].
An excellent historical overview of the Stone–von Neumann theorem [74] by
Jonathan Rosenberg is well worth reading. For not just a proof of Stone–von
Neumann, but some motivation, see the discussion in chapter 14 of [41].

The Poisson Bracket and
Symplectic Geometry

We have seen that the quantum theory of a free particle corresponds to the
construction of a representation of the Heisenberg Lie algebra in terms of
1
P 2 . One
operators Q and P , together with a choice of Hamiltonian H = 2m
would like to use this to produce quantum systems with a similar relation to
more non-trivial classical mechanical systems than the free particle. During
the earliest days of quantum mechanics, it was recognized by Dirac that the
commutation relations of the Q and P operators somehow corresponded to
the Poisson bracket relations between the position and momentum coordinates on phase space in the Hamiltonian formalism for classical mechanics.
In this chapter, we will give an outline of the topic of Hamiltonian mechanics
and the Poisson bracket, including an introduction to the symplectic geometry that characterizes phase space.
The Heisenberg Lie algebra h2d+1 is usually thought of as quintessentially
quantum in nature, but it is already present in classical mechanics, as the Lie
algebra of degree zero and one polynomials on phase space, with Lie bracket
the Poisson bracket. In chapter 16, we will see that degree two polynomials
on phase space also provide an important ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra.
The full Lie algebra of all functions on phase space (with Lie bracket the
Poisson bracket) is inﬁnite dimensional, so not the sort of ﬁnite dimensional
Lie algebra given by matrices that we have studied so far. Historically though,
it is this kind of inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra that motivated the discovery
of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras by Sophus Lie during the 1870s.
It also provides the fundamental mathematical structure of the Hamiltonian
form of classical mechanics.

14 The Poisson Bracket and Symplectic Geometry

14.1 Classical mechanics and the Poisson
bracket
In classical mechanics in the Hamiltonian formalism, the space M = R2d that
one gets by putting together positions and the corresponding momenta is
known as “phase space.” Points in phase space can be thought of as uniquely
parametrizing possible initial conditions for classical trajectories, so another
interpretation of phase space is that it is the space that uniquely parametrizes
solutions of the equations of motion of a given classical mechanical system.
The basic axioms of Hamiltonian mechanics can be stated in a way that
parallels the ones for quantum mechanics.
Axiom (States). The state of a classical mechanical system is given by a
point in the phase space M = R2d , with coordinates qj , pj , for j = 1, . . . , d.
Axiom (Observables). The observables of a classical mechanical system are
the functions on phase space.
Axiom (Dynamics). There is a distinguished observable, the Hamiltonian
function h, and states evolve according to Hamilton’s equations
q̇j =

∂h
∂pj

ṗj = −

∂h
∂qj

Specializing to the case d = 1, for any observable function f , Hamilton’s
equations imply
∂f dq ∂f dp
∂f ∂h ∂f ∂h
df
=
+
=
−
dt
∂q dt
∂p dt
∂q ∂p
∂p ∂q
We can deﬁne:
Definition (Poisson bracket). There is a bilinear operation on functions on
the phase space M = R2 (with coordinates (q, p)) called the Poisson bracket,
given by
∂f1 ∂f2
∂f1 ∂f2
−
(f1 , f2 ) → {f1 , f2 } =
∂q ∂p
∂p ∂q
An observable f evolves in time according to
df
= {f, h}
dt

14.1

Classical mechanics and the Poisson bracket

This relation is equivalent to Hamilton’s equations since it implies them by
taking f = q and f = p
∂h
q̇ = {q, h} =
∂p
ṗ = {p, h} = −

∂h
∂q

p
For a non-relativistic free particle, h = 2m
and these equations become

q̇ =

p
, ṗ = 0
m

which says that the momentum is the mass times the velocity and is conserved. For a particle subject to a potential V (q) one has
h=

p2
+ V (q)
2m

and the trajectories are the solutions to
q̇ =

p
∂V
, ṗ = −
m
∂q

This adds Newton’s second law
F =−

∂V
= ma = mq̈
∂q

to the relation between momentum and velocity.
One can easily check that the Poisson bracket has the properties
• Antisymmetry

{f1 , f2 } = −{f2 , f1 }

• Jacobi identity
{{f1 , f2 }, f3 } + {{f3 , f1 }, f2 } + {{f2 , f3 }, f1 } = 0
These two properties, together with the bilinearity, show that the Poisson
bracket ﬁts the deﬁnition of a Lie bracket, making the space of functions
on phase space into an inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra. This Lie algebra is
responsible for much of the structure of the subject of Hamiltonian mechanics,
and it was historically the ﬁrst sort of Lie algebra to be studied.
From the fundamental dynamical equation

192

14 The Poisson Bracket and Symplectic Geometry

df
= {f, h}
dt
we see that
{f, h} = 0 =⇒

df
=0
dt

and in this case the function f is called a “conserved quantity,” since it does
not change under time evolution. Note that if we have two functions f1 and
f2 on phase space such that
{f1 , h} = 0, {f2 , h} = 0
then using the Jacobi identity we have
{{f1 , f2 }, h} = −{{h, f1 }, f2 } − {{f2 , h}, f1 } = 0
This shows that if f1 and f2 are conserved quantities, so is {f1 , f2 }. As a
result, functions f such that {f, h} = 0 make up a Lie subalgebra. It is this
Lie subalgebra that corresponds to “symmetries” of the physics, commuting
with the time translation determined by the dynamical law given by h.

14.2 The Poisson bracket and the
Heisenberg Lie algebra
A third fundamental property of the Poisson bracket that can easily be
checked is the
• Leibniz rule
{f1 f2 , f } = {f1 , f }f2 + f1 {f2 , f }, {f, f1 f2 } = {f, f1 }f2 + f1 {f, f2 }
This property says that taking Poisson bracket with a function f acts
on a product of functions in a way that satisﬁes the Leibniz rule for what
happens when you take the derivative of a product. Unlike antisymmetry
and the Jacobi identity, which reﬂect the Lie algebra structure on functions,
the Leibniz property describes the relation of the Lie algebra structure to
multiplication of functions. At least for polynomial functions, it allows one
to inductively reduce the calculation of Poisson brackets to the special case
of Poisson brackets of the coordinate functions q and p, for instance:
{q 2 , qp} = q{q 2 , p} + {q 2 , q}p = q 2 {q, p} + q{q, p}q = 2q 2 {q, p} = 2q 2

14.2

The Poisson bracket and the Heisenberg Lie algebra

193

The Poisson bracket is thus determined by its values on linear functions
(thus by the relations {q, q} = {p, p} = 0, {q, p} = 1). We will deﬁne:
Definition. Ω(·, ·) is the restriction of the Poisson bracket to M ∗ , the linear
functions on M . Taking as basis vectors of M ∗ the coordinate functions q
and p, Ω is given on basis vectors by
Ω(q, q) = Ω(p, p) = 0, Ω(q, p) = −Ω(p, q) = 1
A general element of M ∗ will be a linear combination cq q + cp p for some
constants cq , cp . For general pairs of elements in M ∗ , Ω will be given by
Ω(cq q + cp p, cq q + cp p) = cq cp − cp cq

(14.1)

We will often write elements of M ∗ as the column vector of their coeﬃcients
cq , cp , identifying
 
c
cq q + cp p ↔ q
cp
Then one has
Ω

    
c
cq
, q
= cq cp − cp cq
cp
cp

Taking together linear functions on M and the constant function, one gets
a three-dimensional space with basis elements q, p, 1, and this space is closed
under Poisson bracket. This space is thus a Lie algebra and is isomorphic to
the Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 (see section 13.1), with the isomorphism given
on basis elements by
X ↔ q, Y ↔ p, Z ↔ 1
This isomorphism preserves the Lie bracket relations since
[X, Y ] = Z ↔ {q, p} = 1
It is convenient to choose its own notation for the dual phase space, so we
will often write M ∗ = M. The three-dimensional space we have identiﬁed
with the Heisenberg Lie algebra is then
M⊕R
We will denote elements of this space in two diﬀerent ways
• As functions cq q + cp p + c, with Lie bracket the Poisson bracket
{cq q + cp p + c, cq q + cp p + c } = cq cp − cp cq

194

• As pairs of an element of M and a real number

which is identical to the Lie bracket for h3 of equation 13.1. Notice that
the Lie bracket structure is determined purely by Ω.
In higher dimensions, coordinate functions q1 , · · · , qd , p1 , · · · , pd on M provide a basis for the dual space M. Taking as an additional basis element the
constant function 1, we have a 2d + 1-dimensional space with basis
q1 , · · · , qd , p1 , · · · , pd , 1
The Poisson bracket relations
{qj , qk } = {pj , pk } = 0, {qj , pk } = δjk
turn this space into a Lie algebra, isomorphic to the Heisenberg Lie algebra
h2d+1 . On general functions, the Poisson bracket will be given by the obvious
generalization of the d = 1 case

Elements of h2d+1 are functions on M = R2d of the form
cq1 q1 + · · · + cqd qd + cp1 p1 + · · · + cpd pd + c = cq · q + cp · p + c
(using the notation cq = (cq1 , . . . , cqd ), cp = (cp1 , . . . , cpd )). We will often

14.3 Symplectic geometry
We saw in chapter 4 that given a basis ej of a vector space V , a dual basis
e∗j of V ∗ is given by taking e∗j = vj , where vj are the coordinate functions.
If one instead is initially given the coordinate functions vj , a dual basis of
V = (V ∗ )∗ can be constructed by taking as basis vectors the ﬁrst-order linear
diﬀerential operators given by diﬀerentiation with respect to the vj , in other
words by taking
∂
ej =
∂vj
Elements of V are then identiﬁed with linear combinations of these operators.
In eﬀect, one is identifying vectors v with the directional derivative along the
vector
v ↔v·∇
We also saw in chapter 4 that an inner product (·, ·) on V provides an
isomorphism of V and V ∗ by
v ∈ V ↔ lv (·) = (v, ·) ∈ V ∗

(14.5)

Such an inner product is the fundamental structure in Euclidean geometry,
giving a notion of length of a vector and angle between two vectors, as well as
a group; the orthogonal group of linear transformations preserving the inner
product. It is a symmetric, non-degenerate bilinear form on V .
A phase space M does not usually come with a choice of inner product.
Instead, we have seen that the Poisson bracket gives us not a symmetric
bilinear form, but an antisymmetric bilinear form Ω, deﬁned on the dual space
M. We will deﬁne an analog of an inner product, with symmetry replaced
by antisymmetry:
Definition (Symplectic form). A symplectic form ω on a vector space V is
a bilinear map
ω :V ×V →R
such that
• ω is antisymmetric: ω(v, v  ) = −ω(v, v  )
• ω is non-degenerate: if v = 0, then ω(v, ·) ∈ V ∗ is nonzero.

196

14 The Poisson Bracket and Symplectic Geometry

A vector space V with a symplectic form ω is called a symplectic vector
space. The analog of Euclidean geometry, replacing the inner product by a
symplectic form, is called symplectic geometry. In this sort of geometry, there
is no notion of length (since antisymmetry implies ω(v, v) = 0). There is an
analog of the orthogonal group, called the symplectic group, which consists
of linear transformations preserving ω, a group we will study in detail in
chapter 16.
Just as an inner product gives an identiﬁcation of V and V ∗ , a symplectic
form can be used in a similar way, giving an identiﬁcation of M and M. Using
the symplectic form Ω on M, we can deﬁne an isomorphism by identifying
basis vectors by
∂
∈M
∂pj
∂
pj ∈ M ↔ Ω(·, pj ) = − Ω(pj , ·) =
∈M
∂qj
qj ∈ M ↔ Ω(·, qj ) = − Ω(qj , ·) = −

and in general
u ∈ M ↔ Ω(·, u) = −Ω(u, ·) ∈ M

(14.6)

Note that unlike the inner product case, a choice of convention of minus sign
must be made and is done here.
Recalling the discussion of bilinear forms from section 9.5, a bilinear form
on a vector space V can be identiﬁed with an element of V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ . Taking
V = M ∗ we have V ∗ = (M ∗ )∗ = M , and the bilinear form Ω on M ∗ is an
element of M ⊗ M given by
Ω=

ω=

(qj ⊗ pj − pj ⊗ qj ) ∈ M ∗ ⊗ M ∗

(14.7)

j=1

Another version of the identiﬁcation of M and M is then given by
v ∈ M → ω(v, ·) ∈ M
In the case of Euclidean geometry, one can show by Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization that a basis ej can always be found that puts the inner product
(which is a symmetric element of V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ ) in the standard form

in terms of basis elements of V ∗ , the coordinate functions vj . There is an
analogous theorem in symplectic geometry (for a proof, see, for instance,
Proposition 1.1 of [8]). This says that a basis of a symplectic vector space
V can always be found so that the dual basis coordinate functions come in
pairs qj , pj , with the symplectic form ω, the same one we have found based
on the Poisson bracket, that given by equation 14.7. Note that one diﬀerence
between Euclidean and symplectic geometry is that a symplectic vector space
will always be even-dimensional.
Digression. For those familiar with diﬀerential manifolds, vector ﬁelds
and diﬀerential forms, the notion of a symplectic vector space can be extended
to:
Definition (Symplectic manifold). A symplectic manifold M is a manifold
with a diﬀerential two-form ω(·, ·) (called a symplectic two-form) satisfying
the conditions
• ω is non-degenerate (i.e., for a nowhere zero vector ﬁeld X, ω(X, ·) is a
nowhere zero one-form).
• dω = 0, in which case ω is said to be closed.
The cotangent bundle T ∗ N of a manifold N (i.e., the space of pairs of
a point on N together with a linear function on the tangent space at that
point) provides one class of symplectic manifolds, generalizing the linear case
N = Rd , and corresponding physically to a particle moving on N . A simple
example that is neither linear nor a cotangent bundle is the sphere M = S 2 ,
with ω the area two-form. The Darboux theorem says that, by an appropriate
choice of local coordinates qj , pj on M , symplectic two-forms ω can always be
written in such local coordinates as
ω=

d


dqj ∧ dpj

j=1

Unlike the linear case though, there will in general be no global choice of
coordinates for which this true. Later on, our discussion of quantization will
rely crucially on having a linear structure on phase space, so will not apply
to general symplectic manifolds.
Note that there is no assumption here that M has a metric (i.e., it may not
be a Riemannian manifold). A symplectic two-form ω is a structure on a manifold analogous to a metric but with opposite symmetry properties. Whereas
a metric is a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form on the tangent space
at each point, a symplectic form is an antisymmetric non-degenerate bilinear
form on the tangent space.

Hamiltonian Vector Fields
and the Moment Map

A basic feature of Hamiltonian mechanics is that, for any function f on phase
space M , there are parametrized curves in phase space that solve Hamilton’s
equations
∂f
∂f
q̇j =
ṗj = −
∂pj
∂qj
and the tangent vectors of these parametrized curves provide a vector ﬁeld
on phase space. Such vector ﬁelds are called Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds. There
is a distinguished choice of f , the Hamiltonian function h, which gives the
velocity vector ﬁelds for time evolution trajectories in phase space.
More generally, when a Lie group G acts on phase space M , the inﬁnitesimal action of the group associates to each element L ∈ g a vector ﬁeld XL
on phase space. When these are Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, there is (up to a
constant) a corresponding function μL . The map from L ∈ g to the function
μL on M is called the moment map, and such functions play a central role in
both classical and quantum mechanics. For the case of the action of G = R3
on M = R6 by spatial translations, the components of the momentum arise
in this way, for the action of G = SO(3) by rotations, the angular momentum.
Conventional physics discussions of symmetry in quantum mechanics focus
on group actions on conﬁguration space that preserve the Lagrangian, using
Noether’s theorem to provide corresponding conserved quantities (see chapter 35). In the Hamiltonian formalism described here, these same conserved
quantities appear as moment map functions. The operator quantizations of
these functions provide quantum observables and (modulo the problem of
indeterminacy up to a constant) a unitary representation of G on the state
space H. The use of moment map functions rather than Lagrangian-derived
conserved quantities allows one to work with cases where G acts not on

conﬁguration space, but on phase space, mixing position and momentum coordinates. It also applies to cases where the group action is not a “symmetry”
(i.e., does not commute with time evolution), with the functions μL having
nonzero Poisson brackets with the Hamiltonian function.

15.1 Vector fields and the exponential map
A vector ﬁeld on M = R2 can be thought of as a choice of a two-dimensional
vector at each point in R2 , so given by a vector-valued function

F(q, p) =

Fq (q, p)
Fp (q, p)



Such a vector ﬁeld determines a system of diﬀerential equations
dq
dp

dt

Once initial conditions
q(0) = q0 , p(0) = p0
are speciﬁed, if Fq and Fp are diﬀerentiable functions these diﬀerential equations have a unique solution q(t), p(t), at least for some neighborhood of t = 0
(from the existence and uniqueness theorem that can be found, for instance,
in [48]). These solutions q(t), p(t) describe trajectories in R2 with velocity
vector F(q(t), p(t)), and such trajectories can be used to deﬁne the “ﬂow”
of the vector ﬁeld: for each t, this is the map that takes the initial point
(q(0), p(0)) ∈ R2 to the point (q(t), p(t)) ∈ R2 .
Another equivalent way to deﬁne vector ﬁelds on R2 is to use instead the
directional derivative along the vector ﬁeld, identifying
F(q, p) ↔ F(q, p) · ∇ = Fq (q, p)

space M with linear combinations of ∂q
An advantage of deﬁning vector ﬁelds in this way as ﬁrst-order linear
diﬀerential operators is that it shows that vector ﬁelds form a Lie algebra,
where one takes as Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds X1 , X2 the commutator

15.1

Vector fields and the exponential map

[X1 , X2 ] = X1 X2 − X2 X1

201

(15.1)

of the diﬀerential operators. The commutator of two ﬁrst-order diﬀerential
operators is another ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator since second-order derivatives will cancel, using equality of mixed partial derivatives. In addition,
such a commutator will satisfy the Jacobi identity.
Given this Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds, one can ask what the corresponding
group might be. This is not a ﬁnite dimensional matrix Lie algebra, so exponentiation of matrices will not give the group. The ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld X
can be used to deﬁne an analog of the exponential of a parameter t times X:
Definition (Flow of a vector ﬁeld and the exponential map). The ﬂow of
the vector ﬁeld X on M is the map
ΦX : (t, m) ∈ R × M → ΦX (t, m) ∈ M
satisfying
d
ΦX (t, m) = X(ΦX (t, m))
dt
ΦX (0, m) = m
In words, ΦX (t, m) is the trajectory in M that passes through m ∈ M at
t = 0, with velocity vector given by the vector ﬁeld X evaluated along the
trajectory.
The ﬂow can be written as a map
exp(tX) : m ∈ M → ΦX (t, m) ∈ M
called the exponential map.
If the vector ﬁeld X is diﬀerentiable (with bounded derivative), exp(tX)
will be a well-deﬁned map for some neighborhood of t = 0 and satisfy
exp(t1 X) exp(t2 X) = exp((t1 + t2 )X)
thus providing a one-parameter group of maps from M to itself, with derivative X at the identity.
Digression. For any manifold M , there is an inﬁnite dimensional Lie group,
the group of invertible maps from M to itself, such that the maps and their
inverses are both diﬀerentiable. This group is called the diﬀeomorphism group
of M and written Diﬀ(M ). Its Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds.

202

15 Hamiltonian Vector Fields and the Moment Map

The Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds acts on functions on M by diﬀerentiation.
This is the diﬀerential of the representation of Diﬀ(M ) on functions induced
in the usual way (see equation 1.3) from the action of Diﬀ(M ) on the space
M . This representation, however, is not one of relevance to quantum mechanics, since it acts on functions on phase space, whereas the quantum state
space is given by functions on just half the phase space coordinates (positions
or momenta).

and
Similarly, for f = q one has Xq = − ∂p

q(exp(tXq )(m)) = q(m), p(exp(tXq )(m)) = p(m) − t

(15.4)

Quadratic functions f give vector ﬁelds Xf with components linear in the
coordinates. An important example is the case of the quadratic function
h=

which is the Hamiltonian function for a harmonic oscillator, a system that
will be treated in much more detail beginning in chapter 22. The Hamiltonian

The vector ﬁeld Xh and the trajectories in the qp plane look like this

and describe a periodic motion in phase space.
The relation of vector ﬁelds to the Poisson bracket is given by (see equation
15.2)
{f1 , f2 } = Xf2 (f1 ) = −Xf1 (f2 )
and, in particular,
{q, f } =

∂f
∂f

The deﬁnition we have given here of Xf (equation 15.2) carries with it a
choice of how to deal with a confusing sign issue. Recall that vector ﬁelds
on M form a Lie algebra with Lie bracket the commutator of diﬀerential
operators. A natural question is that of how this Lie algebra is related to the
Lie algebra of functions on M (with Lie bracket the Poisson bracket).
The Jacobi identity implies
{f, {f1 , f2 }} = {{f, f1 }, f2 } + {{f2 , f }, f1 } = {{f, f1 }, f2 } − {{f, f2 }, f1 }
so
X{f1 ,f2 } = Xf2 Xf1 − Xf1 Xf2 = −[Xf1 , Xf2 ]

(15.5)

This shows that the map f → Xf of equation 15.2 that we deﬁned between
these Lie algebras is not quite a Lie algebra homomorphism because of the sign in equation 15.5 (it is called a Lie algebra “antihomomorphism”). The

15.2

205

map that is a Lie algebra homomorphism is
f → −Xf

(15.6)

To keep track of the minus sign here, one needs to keep straight the difference between
• The functions on phase space M are a Lie algebra, with a function f
acting on the function space by the adjoint action
ad(f )(·) = {f, ·}
and
• The functions f provide vector ﬁelds Xf acting on functions on M ,
where
Xf (·) = {·, f } = −{f, ·}
As a simple example, the function p satisﬁes
{p, F (q, p)} = −
so
{p, ·} = −

= −Xp

Note that acting on functions with p in this way is the Lie algebra version
of the representation of the translation group on functions induced from the
translation action on the position (see equations 10.1 and 10.2).
It is important to note that the Lie algebra homomorphism 15.6 from
functions to vector ﬁelds is not an isomorphism, for two reasons:
• It is not injective (one-to-one), since functions f and f + C for any
constant C correspond to the same Xf .
• It is not surjective since not all vector ﬁelds are Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds
(i.e., of the form Xf for some f ). One property that a vector ﬁeld X
must satisfy in order to possibly be a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is
X{g1 , g2 } = {Xg1 , g2 } + {g1 , Xg2 }

(15.7)

for g1 and g2 on M . This is the Jacobi identity for f, g1 , g2 , when X = Xf .
Digression. For a general symplectic manifold M , the symplectic two-form
ω gives us an analog of Hamilton’s equations. This is the following equality of one-forms, relating a Hamiltonian function h and a vector ﬁeld Xh
determining time evolution of trajectories in M

206

15 Hamiltonian Vector Fields and the Moment Map

iXh ω = ω(Xh , ·) = dh
(here, iX is interior product with the vector ﬁeld X). The Poisson bracket in
this context can be deﬁned as follows:
{f1 , f2 } = ω(Xf1 , Xf2 )
Recall that a symplectic two-form is deﬁned to be closed, satisfying the
equation dω = 0, which is then a condition on a three-form dω. Standard differential form computations allow one to express dω(Xf1 , Xf2 , Xf3 ) in terms
of Poisson brackets of functions f1 , f2 , f3 , and one ﬁnds that dω = 0 is the
Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket.
The theory of “prequantization” (see [52], [41]) enlarges the phase space
M to a U (1) bundle with connection, where the curvature of the connection
is the symplectic form ω. Then, the problem of lack of injectivity of the Lie
algebra homomorphism
f → −Xf
is resolved by instead using the map
f → −∇Xf + if

(15.8)

where ∇X is the covariant derivative with respect to the connection. For details of this, see [52] or [41].
In our treatment of functions on phase space M , we have always been
taking such functions to be time-independent. M can be thought of as the
space of trajectories of a classical mechanical system, with coordinates q, p
having the interpretation of initial conditions q(0), p(0) of the trajectories.
The exponential maps exp(tXh ) give an action on the space of trajectories
for the Hamiltonian function h, taking the trajectory with initial conditions
given by m ∈ M to the time-translated one with initial conditions given by
exp(tXh )(m). One should really interpret the formula for Hamilton’s equations
df
= {f, h}
dt
as meaning
d
f (exp(tXh )(m))|t=0 = {f (m), h(m)}
dt
for each m ∈ M .
Given a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xf , the maps
exp(tXf ) : M → M

15.2

Hamiltonian vector fields and canonical transformations

207

are known to physicists as “canonical transformations,” and to mathematicians as “symplectomorphisms.” We will not try and work out in any more
detail how the exponential map behaves in general. In chapter 16, we will
see what happens for f an order-two homogeneous polynomial in the qj , pj .
In that case, the vector ﬁeld Xf will take linear functions on M to linear
functions, thus acting on M, in which case, its behavior can be studied using
the matrix for the linear transformation with respect to the basis elements
qj , pj .
Digression. The exponential map exp(tX) can be deﬁned as above on a
general manifold. For a symplectic manifold M , Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds
Xf will have the property that they preserve the symplectic form, in the sense
that
exp(tXf )∗ ω = ω
This is because
LXf ω = (diXf + iXf d)ω = diXf ω = dω(Xf , ·) = ddf = 0

(15.9)

where LXf is the Lie derivative along Xf .

15.3 Group actions on M and the moment
map
Our fundamental interest is in studying the implications of Lie group actions
on physical systems. In classical Hamiltonian mechanics, with a Lie group G
acting on phase space M , such actions are characterized by their derivative,
which takes elements of the Lie algebra to vector ﬁelds on M . When these
are Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, equation 15.6 can often be used to instead
take elements of the Lie algebra to functions on M . This is known as the
moment map of the group action, and such functions on M will provide our
central tool to understand the implications of a Lie group action on a physical
system. Quantization then takes such functions to operators which will turn
out to be the important observables of the quantum theory.
Given an action of a Lie group G on a space M , there is a map
L ∈ g → XL
from g to vector ﬁelds on M . This takes L to the vector ﬁeld XL which acts
on functions on M by
XL F (m) =

d
F (etL · m)|t=0
dt

(15.10)

208

15 Hamiltonian Vector Fields and the Moment Map

This map, however, is not a homomorphism (for the Lie bracket 15.1 on
vector ﬁelds), but an antihomomorphism. To see why this is, recall that when
a group G acts on a space, we get a representation π on functions F on the
space by
π(g)F (m) = F (g −1 · m)
The derivative of this representation will be the Lie algebra representation
π  (L)F (m) =

d
F (e−tL · m)|t=0 = −XL F (m)
dt

so we see that it is the map
L → π  (L) = −XL
that will be a homomorphism.
When the vector ﬁeld XL is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, we can deﬁne:
Definition (Moment map). Given an action of G on phase space M , a Lie
algebra homomorphism
L → μL
from g to functions on M is said to be a moment map if
XL = XμL
Equivalently, for functions F on M , μL satisﬁes
{μL , F }(m) = −XL F =

d
F (e−tL · m)|t=0
dt

(15.11)

This is sometimes called a “co-moment map,” with the term “moment
map” referring to a repackaged form of the same information, the map
μ : M → g∗
where
(μ(m))(L) = μL (m)
A conventional physical terminology for the statement 15.11 is that “the
function μL generates the symmetry L,” giving its inﬁnitesimal action on
functions.
Only for certain actions of G on M will the XL be Hamiltonian vector
ﬁelds and an identity XL = XμL possible. A necessary condition is that XL
satisfy equation 15.7

15.3

Group actions on M and the moment map

209

XL {g1 , g2 } = {XL g1 , g2 } + {g1 , XL g2 }
Even when a function μL exists such that XμL = XL , it is only unique up
to a constant, since μL and μL + C will give the same vector ﬁeld. To get
a moment map, we need to be able to choose these constants in such a way
that the map
L → μL
is a Lie algebra homomorphism from g to the Lie algebra of functions on M .
When this is possible, the G-action is said to be a Hamiltonian G-action.
When such a choice of constants is not possible, the G-action on the classical
phase space is said to have an “anomaly.”
Digression. For the case of M a general symplectic manifold, the moment
map can still be deﬁned, whenever one has a Lie group G acting on M ,
preserving the symplectic form ω. The inﬁnitesimal condition for such a Gaction is (see equation 15.9)
LX ω = 0
Using the formula

LX = (d + iX )2 = diX + iX d

for the Lie derivative acting on diﬀerential forms (iX is interior product with
the vector ﬁeld X), one has
(diX + iX d)ω = 0
and since dω = 0 we have
diX ω = 0
When M is simply connected, one-forms iX ω whose diﬀerential is 0 (called
“closed”) will be the diﬀerentials of a function (and called “exact”). So there
will be a function μ such that
iX ω(·) = ω(X, ·) = dμ(·)
although such a μ is only unique up to a constant.
Given an element L ∈ g, a G-action on M gives a vector ﬁeld XL by
equation 15.10. When we can choose the constants appropriately and ﬁnd
functions μL satisfying
iXL ω(·) = dμL (·)
such that the map
L → μL

210

15 Hamiltonian Vector Fields and the Moment Map

taking Lie algebra elements to functions on M (with Lie bracket the Poisson
bracket) is a Lie algebra homomorphism, then this is called the moment map.
One can equivalently work with
μ : M → g∗
by deﬁning
(μ(m))(L) = μL (m)

15.4 Examples of Hamiltonian group
actions
Some examples of Hamiltonian group actions are the following:
• For d = 3, an element a of the translation group G = R3 acts on the
phase space M = R6 by translation
m∈M →a·m∈M
such that the coordinates satisfy
q(a · m) = q + a, p(a · m) = p(m)
Taking a to be the corresponding element in the Lie algebra of G = R3 ,
the vector ﬁeld on M corresponding to this action (by 15.10) is
Xa = a1

∂
∂
∂
+ a2
+ a3
∂q1
∂q2
∂q3

and the moment map is given by
μa (m) = a · p(m)

(15.12)

This can be interpreted as a function a · p on M for each element a of
the Lie algebra or as an element p(m) of the dual of the Lie algebra R3
for each point m ∈ M .
• For another example, consider the action of the group G = SO(3) of
rotations on phase space M = R6 given by performing the same SO(3)
rotation on position and momentum vectors. This gives a map from
so(3) to vector ﬁelds on R6 , taking for example
l1 ∈ so(3) → Xl1 = −q3

(this is the vector ﬁeld for an inﬁnitesimal counterclockwise rotation in
the q2 − q3 and p2 − p3 planes, in the opposite direction to the case of
the vector ﬁeld X 12 (q2 +p2 ) in the qp plane of section 15.2). The moment
map here gives the usual expression for the 1-component of the angular
momentum
μl1 = q2 p3 − q3 p2
since one can check from equation 15.2 that Xl1 = Xμl1 . On basis elements of so(3), one has
μlj (m) = (q(m) × p(m))j
Formulated as a map from M to so(3)∗ , the moment map is
μ(m)(l) = (q(m) × p(m)) · l
where l ∈ so(3).
• While most of the material of this chapter also applies to the case of a
general symplectic manifold M , the case of M a vector space has the
feature that G can be taken to be a group of linear transformations of
M , and the moment map will give quadratic polynomials. The previous
example is a special case of this, and more general linear transformations
will be studied in great detail in later chapters. In this linear case, it
turns out that it is generally best to work not with M but with its dual
space M.

15.5 The dual of a Lie algebra
and symplectic geometry
We have been careful to keep track of the diﬀerence between phase space
M = R2d and its dual M = M ∗ , even though the symplectic form provides
an isomorphism between them (see equation 14.6). One reason for this is that
it is M = M ∗ that is related to the Heisenberg Lie algebra by
h2d+1 = M ⊕ R
with M the linear functions on phase space, R the constant functions, and
the Poisson bracket the Lie bracket. It is this Lie algebra that we want to use
in chapter 17 when we deﬁne the quantization of a classical system.
Another reason to carefully keep track of the diﬀerence between M and M
is that they carry two diﬀerent actions of the Heisenberg group, coming from
the fact that the group acts quite diﬀerently on its Lie algebra (the adjoint
action) and on the dual of its Lie algebra (the “co-adjoint” action). On M
and M these actions become:

212

15 Hamiltonian Vector Fields and the Moment Map

• The Heisenberg group H2d+1 acts on its Lie algebra h2d+1 = M ⊕ R by
the adjoint action, with the diﬀerential of this action given as usual by
the Lie bracket (see equation 5.4). Here, this means

• The simplest way to deﬁne the “co-adjoint” action in this case is to
deﬁne it as the Hamiltonian action of H2d+1 on M = R2d such that its
moment map μL is just the identiﬁcation of h2d+1 with functions on M .

μL = L = cq q + cp p + c ∈ h3

It is a general phenomenon that for any Lie algebra g, a Poisson bracket
on functions on the dual space g∗ can be deﬁned. This is because the Leibniz
property ensures that the Poisson bracket only depends on Ω, its restriction
to linear functions, and linear functions on g∗ are elements of g. So a Poisson
bracket on functions on g∗ is given by ﬁrst deﬁning
Ω(X, X  ) = [X, X  ]

(15.14)

for X, X  ∈ g = (g∗ )∗ and then extending this to all functions on g∗ by the
Leibniz property.
Such a Poisson bracket on functions on the vector space g∗ is said to provide a “Poisson structure” on g∗ . In general, it will not provide a symplectic

15.5

The dual of a Lie algebra and symplectic geometry

213

structure on g∗ , since it will not be non-degenerate. For example, in the case
of the Heisenberg Lie algebra
g∗ = M ⊕ R
and Ω will be non-degenerate only on the subspace M , the phase space, which
it will give a symplectic structure.
Digression. The Poisson structure on g∗ can often be used to get a symplectic structure on submanifolds of g∗ . As an example, take g = so(3), in
which case g∗ = R3 , with antisymmetric bilinear form ω given by the vector
cross-product. In this case, it turns out that if one considers spheres of ﬁxed
radius in R3 , ω provides a symplectic form proportional to the area two-form,
giving such spheres the structure of a symplectic manifold.
This is a special case of a general construction. Taking the dual of the
adjoint representation Ad on g, there is an action of g ∈ G on g∗ by the
representation Ad∗ , satisfying
(Ad∗ (g) · l)(X) = l(Ad(g −1 )X)
This is called the “co-adjoint” action on g∗ . Picking an element l ∈ g∗ ,
the orbit Ol of the co-adjoint action turns out to be a symplectic manifold. It
comes with an action of G preserving the symplectic structure (the restriction
of the co-adjoint action on g∗ to the orbit). In such a case, the moment map
μ : Ol → g∗
is just the inclusion map. Two simple examples are
• For g = h3 , phase space M = R2 with the Heisenberg group action of
equation 15.13 is given by a co-adjoint orbit, taking l ∈ h∗3 to be the dual
basis vector to the basis vector of h3 given by the constant function 1 on
R2 .
• For g = so(3) the nonzero co-adjoint orbits are spheres, with radius
the length of l, the symplectic form described above, and an action of
G = SO(3) preserving the symplectic form.
Note that in the second example, the standard inner product on R3 provides
a SO(3) invariant identiﬁcation of the Lie algebra with its dual, and as a
result, the adjoint and co-adjoint actions are much the same. In the case of
H3 , there is no invariant inner product on h3 , so the adjoint and co-adjoint
actions are rather diﬀerent, explaining the diﬀerent actions of H3 on M and
M described earlier.

Chapter 16

Quadratic Polynomials
and the Symplectic Group

In Chapters 14 and 15, we studied in detail the Heisenberg Lie algebra as
the Lie algebra of linear functions on phase space. After quantization, such
functions will give operators Qj and Pj on the state space H. In this chapter,
we will begin to investigate what happens for quadratic functions with the
symplectic Lie algebra now the one of interest.
The existence of non-trivial Poisson brackets between homogeneous order
two and order one polynomials reﬂects the fact that the symplectic group
acts by automorphisms on the Heisenberg group. The signiﬁcance of this
phenomenon will only become clear in later chapters, where examples will
appear of interesting observables coming from the symplectic Lie algebra that
are quadratic in the Qj and Pj and act not just on states, but non-trivially
on the Qj and Pj observables.
The identiﬁcation of elements L of the Lie algebra sp(2d, R) with order two
polynomials μL on phase space M is just the moment map for the action of
the symplectic group Sp(2d, R) on M . Quantization of these quadratic functions will provide quantum observables corresponding to any Lie subgroup
G ⊂ Sp(2d, R) (any Lie group G that acts linearly on M preserving the symplectic form). Such quantum observables may or may not be “symmetries,”
with the term “symmetry” usually meaning that they arise by quantization
of a μL such that {μL , h} = 0 for h the Hamiltonian function.
The reader should be warned that the discussion here is not at this stage
physically very well motivated, with much of the motivation only appearing
in later chapters, especially in the case of the observables of quantum ﬁeld
theory, which will be quadratic in the ﬁelds, and act by automorphisms on
the ﬁelds themselves.

16 Quadratic Polynomials and the Symplectic Group

16.1 The symplectic group
Recall that the orthogonal group can be deﬁned as the group of linear transformations preserving an inner product, which is a symmetric bilinear form.
We now want to study the analog of the orthogonal group that comes from
replacing the inner product by the antisymmetric bilinear form Ω that determines the symplectic geometry of phase space. We will deﬁne:
Definition (Symplectic Group). The symplectic group Sp(2d, R) is the subgroup of linear transformations g of M = R2d that satisfy
Ω(gv1 , gv2 ) = Ω(v1 , v2 )
for v1 , v2 ∈ M
While this deﬁnition uses the dual phase space M and Ω, it would have
been equivalent to have made the deﬁnition using M and ω, since these
transformations preserve the isomorphism between M and M given by Ω
(see equation 14.6). For an action on M
u ∈ M → gu ∈ M
the action on elements of M (such elements correspond to linear functions
Ω(u, ·) on M) is given by
Ω(u, ·) ∈ M → g · Ω(u, ·) = Ω(u, g −1 (·)) = Ω(gu, ·) ∈ M

(16.1)

Here, the ﬁrst equality uses the deﬁnition of the dual representation (see 4.2)
to get a representation on linear functions on M given a representation on
M, and the second uses the invariance of Ω.

16.1.1 The symplectic group for d = 1

the case d = 1 and the group Sp(2, R). We can write Ω as

This says that we can have any linear transformation with unit determinant.
In other words, we ﬁnd that Sp(2, R) = SL(2, R). This isomorphism with a
special linear group occurs only for d = 1.
Now turning to the Lie algebra, for group elements g ∈ GL(2, R) near
the identity, g can be written in the form g = etL where L is in the Lie
algebra gl(2, R). The condition that g acts on M preserving Ω implies that

The group SL(2, R) is non-compact, and its representation theory is quite
unlike the case of SU (2). In particular, all of its non-trivial irreducible unitary representations are inﬁnite dimensional, forming an important topic in
mathematics, but one that is beyond our scope. We will be studying just one
such irreducible representation (the one provided by the quantum mechanical
state space), and it is a representation only of a double cover of SL(2, R),
not of SL(2, R) itself.

16.1.2 The symplectic group for arbitrary d

where cq , cp are d-dimensional vectors. By essentially the same calculation as
in the d = 1 case, we ﬁnd the d-dimensional generalization of equation 16.4.

deﬁnition of the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group.

We will postpone the proof of this theorem until section 16.2, since it is
easier to ﬁrst study Poisson brackets between order two and order one polynomials, then use this to prove the theorem about Poisson brackets between
order two polynomials. As in d = 1, the function μL is the moment map
function for L.
The Lie algebra sp(2d, R) has a subalgebra gl(d, R) consisting of matrices
of the form

L=

or, in terms of quadratic functions, the functions
− q · Ap = −(AT p) · q

(16.14)

where A is any real d by d matrix. This shows that one way to get symplectic transformations is to take any linear transformation of the position
coordinates, together with the dual linear transformation (see deﬁnition 4.2)
on momentum coordinates. In this way, any linear group acting on position
space gives a subgroup of the symplectic transformations of phase space.
An example of this is the group SO(d) of spatial rotations, with Lie algebra
so(d) ⊂ gl(d, R), the antisymmetric d by d matrices, for which −AT = A. The
special case d = 3 was an example already worked out earlier, in section 15.4,
where μL gives the standard expression for the angular momentum as a function of the qj , pj coordinates on phase space.
Another important special case comes from taking A = 0, B = 1, C = −1
in equation 16.12, which by equation 16.13 gives
μL =

1
(|q|2 + |p|2 )
2

This generalizes the case of d = 1 described earlier and will be the Hamiltonian function for a d-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Note that exponentiating L gives a symplectic action on phase space that mixes position and
momentum coordinates, so this an example that cannot be understood just
in terms of a group action on conﬁguration space.

16 Quadratic Polynomials and the Symplectic Group

16.2 The symplectic group and
automorphisms of the Heisenberg
group
Returning to the d = 1 case, we have found two three-dimensional Lie algebras (h3 and sl(2, R)) as subalgebras of the inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra
of functions on phase space:
• h3 , the Lie algebra of linear polynomials on M , with basis 1, q, p.
• sl(2, R), the Lie algebra of order two homogeneous polynomials on M ,
with basis q 2 , p2 , qp.
Taking all quadratic polynomials, we get a six-dimensional Lie algebra with
basis elements 1, q, p, qp, q 2 , p2 . This is not the direct product of h3 and
sl(2, R) since there are nonzero Poisson brackets
{qp, q} =
{

2

p
, q} =
2

− q, {qp, p} = p
− p, {

q2
, p} = q
2

(16.15)

These relations show that operating on a basis of linear functions on M by
taking the Poisson bracket with something in sl(2, R) (a quadratic function)
provides a linear transformation on M ∗ = M.
In this section, we will see that this is the inﬁnitesimal version of the fact
that SL(2, R) acts on the Heisenberg group H3 by automorphisms. We will
begin with a general discussion of what happens when a Lie group G acts by
automorphisms on a Lie group H, then turn to two examples: the conjugation
action of G on itself and the action of SL(2, R) on H3 .
An action of one group on another by automorphisms means the following:
Definition (Group automorphisms). If an action of elements g of a group
G on a group H
h ∈ H → Φg (h) ∈ H
satisﬁes
Φg (h1 )Φg (h2 ) = Φg (h1 h2 )
for all g ∈ G and h1 , h2 ∈ H, the group G is said to act on H by automorphisms. Each map Φg is an automorphism of H. Note that since Φg is an
action of G, we have Φg1 g2 = Φg1 Φg2 .
When the groups are Lie groups, taking the derivative φg : h → h of the
map Φg : H → H at the identity of H gives a Lie algebra automorphism,
deﬁned by

Definition (Lie algebra automorphisms). If an action of elements g of a
group G on a Lie algebra h
X ∈ h → φg (X) ∈ h
satisﬁes
[φg (X), φg (Y )] = φg ([X, Y ])
for all g ∈ G and X, Y ∈ h, the group is said to act on h by automorphisms.
Given an action φg of a Lie group G on h, we get an action of elements
Z ∈ g on h by linear maps:
X →Z ·X =

d
(φ tZ (X))|t=0

(16.16)

Z · [X, Y ] =

and one can deﬁne
Definition (Lie algebra derivations). If an action of a Lie algebra g on a
Lie algebra h by linear maps
X ∈h→Z ·X ∈h
satisﬁes
[Z · X, Y ] + [X, Z · Y ] = Z · [X, Y ]

(16.17)

for all Z ∈ g and X, Y ∈ h, the Lie algebra g is said to act on h by derivations.
The action of an element Z on h is a derivation of h.

16.2.1 The adjoint representation and inner
automorphisms
Any group G acts on itself by conjugation, with
Φg (g  ) = gg  g −1

224

16 Quadratic Polynomials and the Symplectic Group

giving an action by automorphisms (these are called “inner automorphisms”).
The derivative at the identity of the map Φg is the linear map on g given
by the adjoint representation operators Ad(g) discussed in Chapter 5. So, in
this case the corresponding action by automorphisms on the Lie algebra g is
the adjoint action
X ∈ g → φg (X) = Ad(g)(X) = gXg −1
The inﬁnitesimal version of the Lie group adjoint representation by Ad(g)
on g is the Lie algebra adjoint representation by operators ad(Z) on g
X ∈ g → Z · X = ad(Z)(X) = [Z, X]
This is an action of g on itself by derivations.

Recall that, in the exponential coordinates we use, the exponential map
between the Lie algebra h3 and the Lie group H3 is the identity map, with
both h3 and H3 identiﬁed with R2 ⊕ R. As in section 14.2, we will explicitly
identify h3 with functions cq q + cp p + c on M , writing these as

The linearized action of Φg at the identity of H3 gives the action φg on h3 ,
but since the exponential map is the identity, φg acts on R2 ⊕ R = M ⊕ R
in the same way as Φg , by

Since the Lie bracket just depends on Ω, which is SL(2, R) invariant, φg
preserves the Lie bracket and so acts by automorphisms on h3 .
The inﬁnitesimal version of the SL(2, R) action φg on h3 is an action of
sl(2, R) on h3 by derivations. This action can be found by computing (for
L ∈ sl(2, R) and X ∈ h3 ) using equation 16.16 to get

The Poisson brackets between degree two and degree one polynomials discussed at the beginning of this section give an alternate way of calculating
this action of sl(2, R) on h3 by derivations. For a general L ∈ sl(2, R) (see
equation 16.6) and cq q + cp p + C ∈ h3 , we have

SL(2, R) on h3 by automorphisms.

226

16 Quadratic Polynomials and the Symplectic Group

Note that in the larger Lie algebra of all polynomials on M of order two
or less, the action of sl(2, R) on h3 by derivations is part of the adjoint action
of the Lie algebra on itself, since it is given by the Poisson bracket (which is
the Lie bracket), between order two and order one polynomials.

16.3 The case of arbitrary d
For the general case of arbitrary d, the group Sp(2d, R) will act by automorphisms on H2d+1 and h2d+1 , both of which can be identiﬁed with M ⊕ R.
The group acts by linear transformations on the M factor, preserving Ω. The
inﬁnitesimal version of this action is computed as in the d = 1 case to be

Chapter 17

Quantization

Given any Hamiltonian classical mechanical system with phase space R2d ,
physics textbooks have a standard recipe for producing a quantum system,
by a method known as “canonical quantization.” We will see that for linear
functions on phase space, this is just the construction we have already seen
of a unitary representation ΓS of the Heisenberg Lie algebra, the Schrödinger
representation. The Stone–von Neumann theorem assures us that this is the
unique such construction, up to unitary equivalence. We will also see that this
recipe can only ever be partially successful: the Schrödinger representation
gives us a representation of a subalgebra of the Lie algebra of all functions on
phase space (the polynomials of degree two and below), but a no-go theorem
shows that this cannot be extended to a representation of the full inﬁnite
dimensional Lie algebra. Recipes for quantizing higher-order polynomials will
always suﬀer from a lack of uniqueness, a phenomenon known to physicists
as the existence of “operator ordering ambiguities.”
In later chapters, we will see that this quantization prescription does give
unique quantum systems corresponding to some Hamiltonian systems (in
particular the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom), and does so in a
manner that allows a description of the quantum system purely in terms of
representation theory.

17.1 Canonical quantization
Very early on in the history of quantum mechanics, when Dirac ﬁrst saw the
Heisenberg commutation relations, he noticed an analogy with the Poisson
bracket. One has



where the last of these equations is the equation for the time-dependence of a
Heisenberg picture observable O(t) in quantum mechanics. Dirac’s suggestion
was that given any classical Hamiltonian system, one could “quantize” it by
ﬁnding a rule that associates to a function f on phase space a self-adjoint
operator Of (in particular Oh = H), acting on a state space H such that
i
O{f,g} = − [Of , Og ]

This is completely equivalent to asking for a unitary representation (π  , H)
of the inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra of functions on phase space (with the
Poisson bracket as Lie bracket). To see this, note that units for momentum
p and position q can be chosen such that  = 1. Then, as usual getting a
skew-adjoint Lie algebra representation operator by multiplying a self-adjoint
operator by −i, setting
π  (f ) = −iOf
the Lie algebra homomorphism property
π  ({f, g}) = [π  (f ), π  (g)]
corresponds to
−iO{f,g} = [−iOf , −iOg ] = −[Of , Og ]
so one has Dirac’s suggested relation.
Recall that the Heisenberg Lie algebra is isomorphic to the threedimensional subalgebra of functions on phase space given by linear combinations of the constant function, the function q and the function p. The
Schrödinger representation ΓS provides a unitary representation not of the
Lie algebra of all functions on phase space, but of these polynomials of degree
at most one, as follows
O1 = 1, Oq = Q, Op = P
so
ΓS (1) = −i1, ΓS (q) = −iQ = −iq, ΓS (p) = −iP = −

d
dq

Moving on to quadratic polynomials, these can also be quantized, as follows

17.1

Canonical quantization

O p2 =

Q2

For the function pq, one can no longer just replace p by P and q by Q since
the operators P and Q do not commute, so the ordering matters. In addition,
neither P Q nor QP is self-adjoint. What does work, satisfying all the conditions to give a Lie algebra homomorphism, is the self-adjoint combination
Opq =

1
(P Q + QP )
2

This shows that the Schrödinger representation ΓS that was deﬁned as a
representation of the Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 extends to a unitary Lie algebra representation of a larger Lie algebra, that of all quadratic polynomials
on phase space, a representation that we will continue to denote by ΓS and
refer to as the Schrödinger representation. On a basis of homogeneous-order
two polynomials, we have

Restricting ΓS to linear combinations of these homogeneous-order two polynomials (which give the Lie algebra sl(2, R), see theorem 16.1), we get a Lie
algebra representation of sl(2, R) called the metaplectic representation.
Restricted to the Heisenberg Lie algebra, the Schrödinger representation
ΓS exponentiates to give a representation ΓS of the corresponding Heisenberg
Lie group (recall section 13.3). As an sl(2, R) representation however, it turns
out that ΓS has the same sort of problem as the spinor representation of
su(2) = so(3), which was not a representation of SO(3), but only of its
double cover SU (2) = Spin(3). To get a group representation, one must go
to a double cover of the group SL(2, R), which will be called the metaplectic
group and denoted M p(2, R).
For an indication of the problem, consider the element

so ψ0 (q) is an eigenvector of ΓS ( 12 (q 2 +p2 )) with eigenvalue − 2i . Exponentiating ΓS ( 12 (q 2 + p2 )), the representation ΓS acts on this state by multiplication
by a phase. As one goes around the group SO(2) once (rotating the qp plane
by an angle from 0 to 2π), the phase angle only goes from 0 to π, demonstrating the same problem that occurs in the case of the spinor representation.
When we study the Schrödinger representation using its action on the
quantum harmonic oscillator state space H in Chapter 22, we will see that
the operator
1 2
(Q + P 2 )
2
is the Hamiltonian operator for the quantum harmonic oscillator, and all of
its eigenvectors (not just ψ0 (q)) have half-integer eigenvalues. In Chapter 24,
we will go on to discuss in more detail the construction of the metaplectic
representation, using methods developed to study the harmonic oscillator.

17.2 The Groenewold–van Hove no-go
theorem
If one wants to quantize polynomial functions on phase space of degree greater
than two, it quickly becomes clear that the problem of “operator ordering
ambiguities” is a signiﬁcant one. Diﬀerent prescriptions involving diﬀerent
ways of ordering the P and Q operators lead to diﬀerent Of for the same
function f , with physically diﬀerent observables (although the diﬀerences
involve the commutator of P and Q, so higher-order terms in ).

17.2

The Groenewold–van Hove no-go theorem

233

When physicists ﬁrst tried to ﬁnd a consistent prescription for producing
an operator Of corresponding to a polynomial function on phase space of
degree greater than two, they found that there was no possible way to do
this consistent with the relation
i
O{f,g} = − [Of , Og ]

for polynomials of degree greater than two. Whatever method one devises
for quantizing higher-degree polynomials, it can only satisfy that relation to
lowest order in , and there will be higher-order corrections, which depend
upon one’s choice of quantization scheme. Equivalently, it is only for the
six-dimensional Lie algebra of polynomials of degree up to two that the
Schrödinger representation gives one a Lie algebra representation, and this
cannot be consistently extended to a representation of a larger subalgebra of
the functions on phase space. This problem is made precise by the following
no-go theorem
Theorem (Groenewold–van Hove). There is no map f → Of from polynomials on R2 to self-adjoint operators on L2 (R) satisfying
i
O{f,g} = − [Of , Og ]

and
Op = P, Oq = Q
for any Lie subalgebra of the functions on R2 for which the subalgebra of
polynomials of degree less than or equal to two is a proper subalgebra.
Proof. For a detailed proof, see section 5.4 of [8], section 4.4 of [26], or chapter
16 of [37]. In outline, the proof begins by showing that taking Poisson brackets of polynomials of degree three leads to higher-order polynomials and that
furthermore for degree three and above there will be no ﬁnite dimensional
subalgebras of polynomials of bounded degree. The assumptions of the theorem force certain speciﬁc operator ordering choices in degree three. These are
then used to get a contradiction in degree four, using the fact that the same
degree four polynomial has two diﬀerent expressions as a Poisson bracket:
q 2 p2 =

{q p, p2 q} = {q 3 , p3 }

17 Quantization

17.3 Canonical quantization in d
dimensions
The above can easily be generalized to the case of d dimensions, with the
Schrödinger representation ΓS now giving a unitary representation of the
Heisenberg Lie algebra h2d+1 determined by
ΓS (qj ) = −iQj , ΓS (pj ) = −iPj
which satisfy the Heisenberg relations
[Qj , Pk ] = iδjk
Generalizing to quadratic polynomials in the phase space coordinate functions, we have
i
ΓS (qj qk ) = −iQj Qk , ΓS (pj pk ) = −iPj Pk , ΓS (qj pk ) = − (Qj Pk + Pk Qj )
2
(17.1)
These operators can be exponentiated to get a representation on the same
H of M p(2d, R), a double cover of the symplectic group Sp(2d, R). This
phenomenon will be examined carefully in later chapters, starting with
Chapter 20 and the calculation in Section 20.3.2, followed by a discussion
in Chapters 24 and 25 using a diﬀerent (but unitarily equivalent) representation that appears in the quantization of the harmonic oscillator. The
Groenewold–van Hove theorem implies that we cannot ﬁnd a unitary representation of a larger group of canonical transformations extending this one
of the Heisenberg and metaplectic groups.

17.4 Quantization and symmetries
The Schrödinger representation is thus a Lie algebra representation providing observables corresponding to elements of the Lie algebras h2d+1 (linear
combinations of Qj and Pk ) and sp(2d, R) (linear combinations of degree
two combinations of Qj and Pk ). The observables that commute with the
Hamiltonian operator H will make up a Lie algebra of symmetries of the
quantum system and will take energy eigenstates to energy eigenstates of the
same energy. Some examples for the physical case of d = 3 are:
• The group R3 of translations in coordinate space is a subgroup of the
Heisenberg group and has a Lie algebra representation as linear combinations of the operators −iPj . If the Hamiltonian is position-independent,
for instance the free particle case of

17.4

Quantization and symmetries

H=

235

1
(P 2 + P22 + P32 )
2m 1

then the momentum operators correspond to symmetries. Note that the
position operators Qj do not commute with this Hamiltonian, and so
do not correspond to a symmetry of the dynamics.
• The group SO(3) of spatial rotations is a subgroup of Sp(6, R), with
so(3) ⊂ sp(6, R) given by the quadratic polynomials in equation 16.14
for A an antisymmetric matrix. Quantizing, the operators
−i(Q2 P3 − Q3 P2 ), −i(Q3 P1 − Q1 P3 ), −i(Q1 P2 − Q2 P1 )
provide a basis for a Lie algebra representation of so(3). This phenomenon will be studied in detail in Chapter 19.2 where we will ﬁnd that for
the Schrödinger representation on position space wavefunctions, these
are the same operators that were studied in Chapter 8 under the name
ρ (lj ). They will be symmetries of rotationally invariant Hamiltonians,
for instance the free particle as above, or the particle in a potential
H=

1
(P 2 + P22 + P32 ) + V (Q1 , Q2 , Q3 )
2m 1

when the potential only depends on the combination Q21 + Q22 + Q23 .

17.5 More general notions of quantization
The deﬁnition given here of quantization using the Schrödinger representation
of h2d+1 only allows the construction of a quantum system based on a classical
phase space for the linear case of M = R2d . For other sorts of classical
systems, one needs other methods to get a corresponding quantum system.
One possible approach is the path integral method, which starts with a choice
of conﬁguration space and Lagrangian and will be discussed in Chapter 35.
Digression. The name “geometric quantization” refers to attempt to generalize quantization to the case of any symplectic manifold M , starting with
the idea of prequantization (see equation 15.8). This gives a representation
of the Lie algebra of functions on M on a space of sections of a line bundle
with connection ∇, with ∇ a connection with curvature ω, where ω is the
symplectic form on M . One then has to deal with two problems:
• The space of all functions on M is far too big, allowing states localized
in both position and coordinate variables in the case M = R2d . One
needs some way to cut down this space to something like a space of
functions depending on only half the variables (e.g., just the positions,

236

17 Quantization

or just the momenta). This requires ﬁnding an appropriate choice of a
so-called “polarization” that will accomplish this.
• To get an inner product on the space of states, one needs to introduce
a twist by a “square root” of a certain line bundle, something called the
“metaplectic correction.”
For more details, see, for instance, [41] or [103].
Geometric quantization focuses on ﬁnding an appropriate state space.
Another general method, the method of “deformation quantization,” focuses
instead on the algebra of operators, with a quantization given by ﬁnding an
appropriate non-commutative algebra that is in some sense a deformation
of a commutative algebra of functions. To ﬁrst order the deformation in the
product law is determined by the Poisson bracket.
Starting with any Lie algebra g, in principle 15.14 can be used to get a
Poisson bracket on functions on the dual space g∗ , and then one can take
the quantization of this to be the algebra of operators known as the universal enveloping algebra U (g). This will in general have many diﬀerent irreducible representations and corresponding possible quantum state spaces. The
co-adjoint orbit philosophy posits an approximate matching between orbits in
g∗ under the dual of the adjoint representation (which are symplectic manifolds) and irreducible representations. Geometric quantization provides one
possible method for trying to associate representations to orbits. For more
details, see [51].
None of the general methods of quantization are fully satisfactory, with
each running into problems in certain cases, or not providing a construction
with all the properties that one would want.

17.6 For further reading
Just about all quantum mechanics textbooks contain some version of the
discussion here of canonical quantization starting with classical mechanical
systems in Hamiltonian form. For discussions of quantization from the point
of view of representation theory, see [8] and chapters 14–16 of [37]. For a
detailed discussion of the Heisenberg group and Lie algebra, together with
their representation theory, also see chapter 2 of [51].

Chapter 18

Semi-direct Products

The theory of a free particle is largely determined by its group of symmetries,
the group of symmetries of three-dimensional space, a group which includes
a subgroup R3 of spatial translations, and a subgroup SO(3) of rotations.
The second subgroup acts non-trivially on the ﬁrst, since the direction of a
translation is rotated by an element of SO(3). In later chapters dealing with
special relativity, these groups get enlarged to include a fourth dimension,
time, and the theory of a free particle will again be determined by the action
of these groups, now on space–time, not just space. In chapters 15 and 16,
we studied two groups acting on phase space: the Heisenberg group H2d+1
and the symplectic group Sp(2d, R). In this situation also, the second group
acts non-trivially on the ﬁrst by automorphisms (see 16.19).
This situation of two groups, with one acting on the other by automorphisms, allows one to construct a new sort of product of the two groups,
called the semi-direct product, and this will be the topic for this chapter.
The general theory of such a construction will be given, but our interest will
be in certain speciﬁc examples: the semi-direct product of R3 and SO(3), the
semi-direct product of H2d+1 and Sp(2d, R), and the Poincaré group (which
will be discussed later, in chapter 42). This chapter will just be concerned
with the groups and their Lie algebras, with their representations the topics
of later chapters (19, 20, and 42).

18.1 An example: the Euclidean group
Given two groups G and G , a product group is formed by taking pairs of
elements (g  , g  ) ∈ G × G . However, when the two groups act on the same
space, but elements of G and G do not commute, a diﬀerent sort of product

group is needed to describe the group action. As an example, consider the
case of pairs (a2 , R2 ) of elements a2 ∈ R3 and R2 ∈ SO(3), acting on R3 by
translation and rotation
v → (a2 , R2 ) · v = a2 + R2 v
If one then acts on the result with (a1 , R1 ), one gets
(a1 , R1 ) · ((a2 , R2 ) · v) = (a1 , R1 ) · (a2 + R2 v) = a1 + R1 a2 + R1 R2 v
Note that this is not what one would get if one took the product group law
on R3 × SO(3), since then the action of (a1 , R1 )(a2 , R2 ) on R3 would be
v → a1 + a 2 + R 1 R 2 v
To get the correct group action on R3 , one needs to take R3 × SO(3) not
with the product group law, but instead with the group law
(a1 , R1 )(a2 , R2 ) = (a1 + R1 a2 , R1 R2 )
This group law diﬀers from the standard product law by a term R1 a2 , which
is the result of R1 ∈ SO(3) acting non-trivially on a2 ∈ R3 . We will denote
the set R3 × SO(3) with this group law by
R3  SO(3)
This is the group of orientation-preserving transformations of R3 preserving
the standard inner product.
The same construction works in arbitrary dimensions, where one has:
Definition (Euclidean group). The Euclidean group E(d) (sometimes written ISO(d) for “inhomogeneous” rotation group) in dimension d is the product of the translation and rotation groups of Rd as a set, with multiplication
law
(a1 , R1 )(a2 , R2 ) = (a1 + R1 a2 , R1 R2 )
(where aj ∈ Rd , Rj ∈ SO(d)) and can be denoted by
Rd  SO(d)
E(d) can also be written as a matrix group, taking it to be the subgroup
of GL(d + 1, R) of matrices of the form (R is a d by d orthogonal matrix, a
a d-dimensional column vector)

18.2 Semi-direct product groups
The Euclidean group example of the previous section can be generalized to
the following:
Definition (Semi-direct product group). Given a group K, a group N , and
an action Φ of K on N by automorphisms
Φk : n ∈ N → Φk (n) ∈ N
the semi-direct product N  K is the set of pairs (n, k) ∈ N × K with group
law
(n1 , k1 )(n2 , k2 ) = (n1 Φk1 (n2 ), k1 k2 )
One can easily check that this satisﬁes the group axioms. The inverse is
(n, k)−1 = (Φk−1 (n−1 ), k −1 )
Checking associativity, one ﬁnds
((n1 , k1 )(n2 , k2 ))(n3 , k3 ) =(n1 Φk1 (n2 ), k1 k2 )(n3 , k3 )
=(n1 Φk1 (n2 )Φk1 k2 (n3 ), k1 k2 k3 )
=(n1 Φk1 (n2 )Φk1 (Φk2 (n3 )), k1 k2 k3 )
=(n1 Φk1 (n2 Φk2 (n3 )), k1 k2 k3 )
=(n1 , k1 )(n2 Φk2 (n3 ), k2 k3 )
=(n1 , k1 )((n2 , k2 )(n3 , k3 ))
The notation N  K for this construction has the weakness of not explicitly
indicating the automorphism Φ which it depends on. There may be multiple
possible choices for Φ, and these will always include the trivial choice Φk = 1
for all k ∈ K, which will give the standard product of groups.
Digression. For those familiar with the notion of a normal subgroup, N is a
normal subgroup of N  K. A standard notation for “N is a normal subgroup

240

18 Semi-direct Products

of G” is N  G. The symbol N  K is supposed to be a mixture of the × and
 symbols (note that some authors define it to point in the other direction).
The Euclidean group E(d) is an example with N = Rd , K = SO(d). For
a ∈ Rd , R ∈ SO(d), one has
ΦR (a) = Ra
In chapter 42, we will see another important example, the Poincaré group
which generalizes E(3) to include a time dimension, treating space and time
according to the principles of special relativity.
The most important example for quantum theory is:
Definition (Jacobi group). The Jacobi group in d dimensions is the semidirect product group
GJ (d) = H2d+1  Sp(2d, R)
If we write elements of the group as
   

18.3 Semi-direct product Lie algebras
We have seen that semi-direct product Lie groups can be constructed by
taking a product N × K of Lie groups as a set, and imposing a group multiplication law that uses an action of K on N by automorphisms. In a similar
manner, semi-direct product Lie algebras n  k can be constructed by taking
the direct sum of n and k as vector spaces, and deﬁning a Lie bracket that uses
an action of k on n by derivations (the inﬁnitesimal version of automorphisms,
see equation 16.17).
Considering ﬁrst the example E(d) = Rd  SO(d), recall that elements
E(d) can be written in the form

Lie algebra of Rd ) and so(d), with elements pairs (a, X) with a ∈ Rd and
X an antisymmetric d by d matrix. The inﬁnitesimal version of the rotation
action of SO(d) on Rd by automorphisms

Just in terms of such pairs, the Lie bracket can be written
[(a1 , X1 ), (a2 , X2 )] = (X1 a2 − X2 a1 , [X1 , X2 ])
We can deﬁne in general:
Definition (Semi-direct product Lie algebra). Given Lie algebras k and n,
and an action of elements Y ∈ k on n by derivations
X ∈n→Y ·X ∈n
the semi-direct product n  k is the set of pairs (X, Y ) ∈ n ⊕ k with the Lie
bracket
[(X1 , Y1 ), (X2 , Y2 )] = ([X1 , X2 ] + Y1 · X2 − Y2 · X1 , [Y1 , Y2 ])
One can easily see that in the special case of the Lie algebra of E(d) this
agrees with the construction above.
In section 16.1.2 we studied the Lie algebra of all polynomials of degree at
most two in d-dimensional phase space coordinates qj , pj , with the Poisson
bracket as Lie bracket. There we found two Lie subalgebras, the degree zero
and one polynomials (isomorphic to h2d+1 ), and the homogeneous degree two
polynomials (isomorphic to sp(2d, R)) with the second subalgebra acting on
the ﬁrst by derivations as in equation 16.22.
Recall from chapter 16 that elements of this Lie algebra can also be written

matrices, the Jacobi group GJ (d) is also a matrix group and one can in principle work with it and its Lie algebra using usual matrix methods. The construction is slightly complicated and represents elements of GJ (d) as matrices
in Sp(2d + 1, R). See section 8.5 of [9] for details of the d = 1 case.

18.4 For further reading
Semi-direct products are not commonly covered in detail in either physics or
mathematics textbooks, with the exception of the case of the Poincaré group
of special relativity, which will be discussed in chapter 42. Some textbooks
that do cover the subject include section 3.8 of [84], chapter 6 of [39] and
[9].

Chapter 19

The Quantum Free Particle
as a Representation of the
Euclidean Group

The quantum theory of a free particle is intimately connected to the
representation theory of the group of symmetries of space and time. This
is well known for relativistic theories, where it is the representation theory of
the Poincaré group that is relevant, a topic that will be discussed in chapter
42. It is less well known that even in the non-relativistic case, the Euclidean group E(3) of symmetries of space plays a similar role, with irreducible
representations of E(3) corresponding to free particle quantum theories for a
ﬁxed value of the energy. In this chapter we will examine this phenomenon,
for both two and three spatial dimensions.
The Euclidean groups E(2) and E(3) in two and three dimensions act on
phase space by a Hamiltonian group action. The corresponding moment maps
(momenta pj for translations, angular momenta lj for rotations) Poisson-commute with the free particle Hamiltonian giving symmetries of the theory. The
quantum free particle theory then provides a construction of unitary representations of the Euclidean group, with the space of states of a ﬁxed energy
giving an irreducible representation. The momentum operators Pj give the
inﬁnitesimal action of translations on the state space, while angular momentum operators Lj give the inﬁnitesimal rotation action (there will be only
one angular momentum operator L in two dimensions since the dimension
of SO(2) is one, three in three dimensions since the dimension of SO(3) is
three).
The Hamiltonian of the free particle is proportional to the operator |P|2 .
This is a quadratic operator that commutes with the action of all the elements of the Lie algebra of the Euclidean group, and so is a Casimir operator
playing an analogous role to that of the SO(3) Casimir operator |L|2 of
section 8.4. Irreducible representations will be labeled by the eigenvalue of
this operator, which in this case will be proportional to the energy. In the
Schrödinger representation, where the Pj are diﬀerentiation operators, this
will be a second-order diﬀerential operator, and the eigenvalue equation will
be a second-order diﬀerential equation (the time-independent Schrödinger
equation).

19 The Quantum Free Particle as a Representation of the Euclidean Group

Using the Fourier transform, the space of solutions of the Schrödinger
equation of ﬁxed energy becomes something much easier to analyze, the space
of functions (or, more generally, distributions) on momentum space supported
only on the subspace of momenta of a ﬁxed length. In the case of E(2) this
is just a circle, whereas for E(3) it is a sphere. In both cases, for each radius
one gets an irreducible representation in this manner.
In the case of E(3), other classes of irreducible representations can be
constructed. This can be done by introducing multicomponent wavefunctions,
with a new action of the rotation group SO(3). A second Casimir operator
is available in this case, and irreducible representations are eigenfunctions of
this operator in the space of wavefunctions of ﬁxed energy. The eigenvalues
of this second Casimir operator turn out to be proportional to an integer, the
“helicity” of the representation.

19.1 The quantum free particle
and representations of E(2)
We will begin for simplicity with the case of two spatial dimensions. Recall
from chapter 18 that the Euclidean group E(d) is a subgroup of the Jacobi
group GJ (d) = H2d+1  Sp(2d, R). For the case d = 2, the translations R2
are a subgroup of the Heisenberg group H5 (translations in q1 , q2 ) and the
rotations are a subgroup SO(2) ⊂ Sp(4, R) (simultaneous rotations of q1 , q2
and p1 , p2 ). The Lie algebra of E(2) is a sub-Lie algebra of the Lie algebra
gJ (2) of polynomials in q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 of degree at most two.
More speciﬁcally, a basis for the Lie algebra of E(2) is given by the functions
l = q1 p2 − q2 p1 , p1 , p2
on the d = 2 phase space M = R4 , where l is a basis for the Lie algebra
so(2) of rotations, p1 , p2 a basis for the Lie algebra R2 of translations. The
nonzero Lie bracket relations are given by the Poisson brackets
{l, p1 } = p2 , {l, p2 } = −p1
which are the inﬁnitesimal version of the rotation action of SO(2) on R2 .
There is an isomorphism of this Lie algebra with a matrix Lie algebra of 3
by 3 matrices given by

The operators L, P1 , P2 commute with H and so provide a representation of
the Lie algebra of E(2) on the space of wavefunctions of energy E.
This construction of irreducible representations of E(2) is similar in spirit
to the construction of irreducible representations of SO(3) in section 8.4.
There the Casimir operator L2 commuted with the SO(3) action, and gave
a diﬀerential operator on functions on the sphere whose eigenfunctions were
spaces of dimension 2l + 1 with eigenvalue l(l + 1), for l nonnegative and
integral. For E(2) the quadratic function p21 + p22 Poisson commutes with
l, p1 , p2 . After quantization,
|P|2 = P12 + P22
is a second-order diﬀerential operator which commutes with L, P1 , P2 . This
operator has inﬁnite dimensional eigenspaces that each carry an irreducible
representation of E(2). They are characterized by a nonnegative eigenvalue
that has physical interpretation as 2mE where m, E are the mass and energy
of a free quantum particle moving in two spatial dimensions.
From our discussion of the free particle in chapter 11 we see that, in

This construction of a representation of E(2) starting with the Schrödinger
representation gives the same result as starting with the action of E(2) on
conﬁguration space, and taking the induced action on functions on R2 (the
wavefunctions). To see this, note that E(2) has elements (a, R(φ)) which can

This representation of E(2) is the same as the exponentiated version of the
Schrödinger representation ΓS of the Jacobi Lie algebra gJ (2), restricted
to the Lie algebra of E(2). This can be seen by considering the action of
translations as the exponential of the Lie algebra representation operators
ΓS (pj ) = −iPj
u(a, 1)ψ(q) = e−i(a1 P1 +a2 P2 ) ψ(q) = ψ(q − a)
and the action of rotations as the exponential of the ΓS (l) = −iL
u(0, R(φ))ψ(q) = e−iφL ψ(q) = ψ(R(−φ)q)

and rotations acting by rotating the circle in momentum space
u
(0, R(φ))ψE (θ) = ψE (θ − φ)

(19.4)

Although we will not prove it here, the representations constructed in this
way provide essentially all the unitary irreducible representations of E(2),
parametrized by a real number E > 0. The only other ones are those on which
the translations act trivially, corresponding to E = 0, with SO(2) acting as
an irreducible representation. We have seen that such SO(2) representations
are one dimensional, and characterized by an integer, the weight. We thus
get another class of E(2) irreducible representations, labeled by an integer,
but they are just one-dimensional representations on C.

19.2 The case of E(3)
In the physical case of three spatial dimensions, the state space of the theory of a quantum free particle is again a Euclidean group representation,
with the same relationship to the Schrödinger representation as in two spatial dimensions. The main diﬀerence is that the rotation group is now three
dimensional and non-commutative, so instead of the single Lie algebra basis
element l we have three of them, satisfying Poisson bracket relations that are
the Lie algebra relations of so(3)
{l1 , l2 } = l3 , {l2 , l3 } = l1 , {l3 , l1 } = l2

252

19 The Quantum Free Particle as a Representation of the Euclidean Group

The pj give the other three basis elements of the Lie algebra of E(3). They
commute among themselves, and the action of rotations on vectors provides
the rest of the non-trivial Poisson bracket relations
{l1 , p2 } = p3 , {l1 , p3 } = −p2
{l2 , p1 } = −p3 , {l2 , p3 } = p1

The case of E(3)

provides a representation of E(3).
As in the E(2) case, the above Lie algebra representation is just the inﬁnitesimal version of the action of E(3) on functions induced from its action on
position space R3 . Given an element g = (a, R) ∈ E(3), we have a unitary
transformation on wavefunctions
u(a, R)ψ(q) = ψ(g −1 · q) = ψ(R−1 (q − a))
Such group elements g will be a product of a translation and a rotation, and
treating these separately, the unitary transformations u are exponentials of
the Lie algebra actions above, with
u(a, 1)ψ(q) = e−i(a1 P1 +a2 P2 +a3 P3 ) ψ(q) = ψ(q − a)
for a translation by a, and
u(0, R(φ, ej ))ψ(q) = e−iφLj ψ(q) = ψ(R(−φ, ej )q)
for R(φ, ej ) a rotation about the j-axis by angle φ.
This representation of E(3) on wavefunctions is reducible, since in terms
of momentum eigenstates, rotations will only take eigenstates with one value
of the momentum to those with another value of the same norm-squared.
We can get an irreducible representation by using the Casimir operator P12 +
P22 + P32 , which commutes with all elements in the Lie algebra of E(3). The
Casimir operator will act on an irreducible representation as a scalar, and
the representation will be characterized by that scalar. The Casimir operator
is just 2m times the Hamiltonian
H=

(P 2 + P22 + P32 )

and so the constant characterizing an irreducible will be the energy 2mE.
Our irreducible representation will be on the space of solutions of the timeindependent Schrödinger equation

19.3 Other representations of E(3)
For the case of E(3), besides the representations parametrized by E > 0
constructed above, as in the E(2) case there are ﬁnite dimensional representations where the translation subgroup of E(3) acts trivially. Such irreducible
representations are just the spin-s representations (ρs , C2s+1 ) of SO(3) for
s = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
E(3) has some structure not seen in the E(2) case, which can be used to
construct new classes of inﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations. This
can be seen from two diﬀerent points of view:
• There is a second Casimir operator which one can show commutes with
the E(3) action, given by
L · P = L1 P1 + L2 P2 + L3 P3
• The group SO(3) acts on momentum vectors by rotation, with orbit of
the group action the sphere of momentum vectors of ﬁxed energy E > 0.

19.3

Other representations of E(3)

255

This is the sphere on which the Fourier transform of the wavefunctions
in the representation is supported. Unlike the corresponding circle in
the E(2) case, here there is a non-trivial subgroup of the rotation group
SO(3) which leaves a given momentum vector invariant. This is the
SO(2) ⊂ SO(3) subgroup of rotations about the axis determined by the
momentum vector, and it is diﬀerent for diﬀerent points in momentum
space.

Figure 19.2: Copy of SO(2) leaving a given momentum vector invariant.

For single-component wavefunctions, a straightforward computation shows
that the second Casimir operator L · P acts as zero. By introducing wavefunctions with several components, together with an action of SO(3) that
mixes the components, it turns out that one can get new irreducible representations, with a nonzero value of the second Casimir corresponding to a
non-trivial weight of the action of the SO(2) of rotations about the momentum vector.
Such multiple-component wavefunctions can be constructed as representations of E(3) by taking the tensor product of our irreducible representation
on wavefunctions of energy E (call this HE ) and the ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representation C2s+1
HE ⊗ C2s+1
The Lie algebra representation operators for the translation part of E(3) act
as momentum operators on HE and as 0 on C2s+1 . For the SO(3) part of

256

19 The Quantum Free Particle as a Representation of the Euclidean Group

E(3), we get angular momentum operators that can be written as
Jj = Lj + Sj ≡ Lj ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ Sj
where Lj acts on HE and Sj = ρ (lj ) acts on C2s+1 .
This tensor product representation will not be irreducible, but its irreducible components can be found by taking the eigenspaces of the second
Casimir operator, which will now be
J·P
We will not work out the details of this here (although details can be found
in chapter 34 for the case s = 12 , where the half-integrality corresponds to
replacing SO(3) by its double cover Spin(3)). What happens is that the
tensor product breaks up into irreducibles as
HE ⊗ C2s+1 =

n=s

HE,n
n=−s

where n is an integer taking values from −s to s that is called the “helicity.” HE,n is the subspace of the tensor product on which the ﬁrst Casimir
|P|2 takes the
√ value 2mE, and the second Casimir J · P takes the value np,
where p = 2mE. The physical interpretation of the helicity is that it is
the component of angular momentum along the axis given by the momentum
vector. The helicity can also be thought of as the weight of the action of the
SO(2) subgroup of SO(3) corresponding to rotations about the axis of the
momentum vector.
Choosing E > 0 and n ∈ Z, the representations on HE,n (which we have
constructed using some s such that s ≥ |n|) give all possible irreducible representations of E(3). The representation spaces have a physical interpretation
as the state space for a free quantum particle of energy E which carries an
“internal” quantized angular momentum about its direction of motion, given
by the helicity.

19.4 For further reading
The angular momentum operators are a standard topic in every quantum
mechanics textbook, see, for example, chapter 12 of [81]. The characterization here of free particle wavefunctions at ﬁxed energy as giving irreducible
representations of the Euclidean group is not so conventional, but it is just a
non-relativistic version of the conventional description of relativistic quantum
particles in terms of representations of the Poincaré group (see chapter 42).

19.4

For further reading

257

In the Poincaré group case the analog of the E(3) irreducible representations of nonzero energy E and helicity n considered here will be irreducible
representations labeled by a nonzero mass and an irreducible representation
of SO(3) (the spin). In the Poincaré group case, for massless particles one
will again see representations labeled by an integral helicity (an irreducible
representation of SO(2)), but there is no analog of such massless particles in
the E(3) case.
For more details about representations of E(2) and E(3), see [94] or [97]
(which is based on [92]).

Chapter 20

Representations of Semi-direct
Products

In this chapter, we will examine some aspects of representations of semi-direct
products, in particular for the case of the Jacobi group and its Lie algebra,
as well as the case of N  K, for N commutative. The latter case includes
the Euclidean groups E(d), as well as the Poincaré group which will come
into play once we introduce special relativity.
The Schrödinger representation provides a unitary representation of the
Heisenberg group, one that carries extra structure arising from the fact that
the symplectic group acts on the Heisenberg group by automorphisms. Each
such automorphism takes a given construction of the Schrödinger representation to a unitarily equivalent one, providing an operator on the state space
called an “intertwining operator.” These intertwining operators will give (up
to a phase factor) a representation of the symplectic group. Up to the problem of the phase factor, the Schrödinger representation in this way extends
to a representation of the full Jacobi group. To explicitly ﬁnd the phase factor, one can start with the Lie algebra representation, where the sp(2d, R)
action is given by quantizing quadratic functions on phase space. It turns
out that, for a ﬁnite dimensional phase space, exponentiating the Lie algebra
representation gives a group representation up to sign, which can be turned
into a true representation by taking a double cover (called M p(2d, R)) of
Sp(2d, R).
In later chapters, we will ﬁnd that many groups acting on quantum systems
can be understood as subgroups of this M p(2d, R), with the corresponding
observables arising as the quadratic combinations of momentum and position
operators determined by the moment map.
The Euclidean group E(d) is a subgroup of the Jacobi group, and we
saw in Chapter 19 how some of its representations can be understood by
restricting the Schrödinger representation to this subgroup. More generally,
this is an example of a semi-direct product N  K with N commutative. In
such cases, irreducible representations can be characterized in terms of the
action of K on irreducible representations of N , together with the irreducible
representations of certain subgroups of K.

20 Representations of Semi-direct Products

The reader should be warned that much of the material included in this
chapter is motivated not by its applications to non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, a context in which such an abstract point of view is not particularly helpful. The motivation for this material is provided by more complicated cases in relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, but it seems worthwhile
to ﬁrst see how these ideas work in a simpler context. In particular, the discussion of representations of N  K for N commutative is motivated by the
case of the Poincaré group (see chapter 42). The treatment of intertwining
operators is motivated by the way symmetry groups act on quantum ﬁelds
(a topic which will ﬁrst appear in chapter 38).

20.1 Intertwining operators
and the metaplectic representation
For a general semi-direct product N  K with non-commutative N , the representation theory can be quite complicated. For the Jacobi group case though,
it turns out that things simplify dramatically because of the Stone–von Neumann theorem which says that, up to unitary equivalence, we only have one
irreducible representation of N = H2d+1 .
In the general case, recall that for each k ∈ K the deﬁnition of the semidirect product comes with an automorphism Φk : N → N satisfying Φk1 k2 =
Φk1 Φk2 . Given a representation π of N , for each k we can deﬁne a new
representation πk of N by ﬁrst acting with Φk :
πk (n) = π(Φk (n))
In the special case of the Heisenberg group and Schrödinger representation
ΓS , we can do this for each k ∈ K = Sp(2d, R), deﬁning a new representation by
ΓS,k (n) = ΓS (Φk (n))
The Stone–von Neumann theorem assures us that these must all be unitarily equivalent, so there must exist unitary operators Uk satisfying
ΓS,k = Uk ΓS Uk−1 = ΓS (Φk (n))
We will generally work with the Lie algebra version ΓS of the Schrödinger
representation, for which the same argument applies: We expect to be able to
ﬁnd unitary operators Uk relating Lie algebra representations ΓS and ΓS,k by
ΓS,k (X) = Uk ΓS (X)Uk−1 = ΓS (Φk (X))

(20.1)

20.1

Intertwining operators and the metaplectic representation

261

where X is in the Heisenberg Lie algebra, and k acts by automorphism Φk
on this Lie algebra.
Operators like Uk that relate two representations are called “intertwining
operators”:
Definition (Intertwining operator). If (π1 , V1 ), (π2 , V2 ) are two representations of a group G, an intertwining operator between these two representations
is an operator U such that
π2 (g)U = U π1 (g) ∀g ∈ G
In our case, V1 = V2 is the Schrödinger representation state space H and
Uk : H → H is an intertwining operator between ΓS and ΓS,k for each k ∈
Sp(2d, R).
Since
ΓS,k1 k2 = Uk1 k2 ΓS Uk−1
1 k2
one might expect that the Uk should satisfy the group homomorphism property
Uk1 k2 = Uk1 Uk2
and give us a representation of the group Sp(2d, R) on H. This is what would
follow from the general principle that a group action on the classical phase
space after quantization becomes a unitary representation on the quantum
state space.
The problem with this argument is that the Uk are not uniquely deﬁned.
Schur’s lemma tells us that since the representation on H is irreducible, the
operators commuting with the representation operators are just the complex
scalars. These give a phase ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the unitary operators Uk , which then give a representation of Sp(2d, R) on H only up to a
phase, i.e.,
Uk1 k2 = Uk1 Uk2 eiϕ(k1 ,k2 )
for some real-valued function ϕ of pairs of group elements. In terms of corresponding Lie algebra representation operators UL , this ambiguity appears
as an unknown constant times the identity operator.
The question then arises whether the phases of the Uk can be chosen so
as to satisfy the homomorphism property (i.e., can phases be chosen so that
ϕ(k1 , k2 ) = N 2π for N integral?). It turns out that this cannot quite be done,
since N may have to be half-integral, giving the homomorphism property only
up to a sign. Just as in the SO(d) case where a similar sign ambiguity showed
the need to go to a double cover Spin(d) to get a true representation, here
one needs to go to a double cover of Sp(2d, R), called the metaplectic group
M p(2d, R). The nature of this sign ambiguity and double cover is quite subtle,

262

20 Representations of Semi-direct Products

and unlike for the Spin(d) case, we will not provide an actual construction
of M p(2d, R). For more details on this, see [56] or [37]. In section 20.3.2, we
will show by computation one aspect of the double cover.
Since this is just a sign ambiguity, it does not appear inﬁnitesimally: The
ambiguous constants in the Lie algebra representation operators can be chosen so that the Lie algebra homomorphism property is satisﬁed. However, this
will no longer necessarily be true for inﬁnite dimensional phase spaces, a situation that is described as an “anomaly” in the symmetry. This phenomenon
will be examined in more detail in chapter 39.

20.2 Constructing intertwining operators
The method we will use to construct the intertwining operators Uk is to ﬁnd
a solution to the diﬀerentiated version of equation 20.1 and then get Uk by
exponentiation. Diﬀerentiating 20.1 for k = etL at t = 0 gives
[UL , ΓS (X)] = ΓS (L · X)
where
L·X =

and we have used equation 5.1 on the left-hand side.

Recall from 16.1.2 that the μL are quadratic polynomials in the qj , pj . We saw
in section 17.3 that the Schrödinger representation ΓS could be extended from
the Heisenberg Lie algebra to the symplectic Lie algebra, by taking a product
of Qj , Pj operators corresponding to the product in μL . The ambiguity in
ordering for non-commuting operators is resolved by quantizing qj pj using
i
ΓS (qj pj ) = − (Qj Pj + Pj Qj )

20.2

Constructing intertwining operators

We thus take

263

UL = ΓS (μL )

and this will satisfy 20.3 as desired. It will also satisfy the Lie algebra homomorphism property

(20.5)
[UL 1 , UL 2 ] = U[L
1 ,L2 ]
If one shifts UL by a constant operator, it will still satisfy 20.3, but in general
will no longer satisfy 20.5. Exponentiating this UL will give us our Uk , and
thus the intertwining operators that we want.
This method will be our fundamental way of producing observable operators. They come from an action of a Lie group on phase space preserving the
Poisson bracket. For an element L of the Lie algebra, we ﬁrst use the moment
map to ﬁnd μL , the classical observable, then quantize to get the quantum
observable UL .

20.3 Explicit calculations
As a balance to the abstract discussion so far in this chapter, in this section we
will work out explicitly what happens for some simple examples of subgroups
of Sp(2d, R) acting on phase space. They are chosen because of important
later applications, but also because the calculations are quite simple, while
demonstrating some of the phenomena that occur. The general story of how
to explicitly construct the full metaplectic representation is quite a bit more
complex. These calculations will also make clear the conventions being chosen
and show the basic structure of what the quadratic operators corresponding
to actions of subgroups of the symplectic group look like, a structure that
will reappear in the much more complicated inﬁnite dimensional quantum
ﬁeld theory examples we will come to later.

20.3.1 The SO(2) action by rotations of the plane
for d = 2
In the case d = 2, one can consider the SO(2) group which acts as the group
of rotations of the conﬁguration space R2 , with a simultaneous rotation of
the momentum space. This leaves invariant the Poisson bracket and so is a
subgroup of Sp(4, R) (this is just the SO(2) subgroup of E(2) studied in
section 19.1).

264

20 Representations of Semi-direct Products

From the discussion in section 16.2, this SO(2) acts by automorphisms on
the Heisenberg group H5 and Lie algebra h5 , both of which can be identiﬁed
with M ⊕ R, by an action leaving invariant the R component. The group
SO(2) acts on cq1 q1 + cq2 q2 + cp1 p1 + cp2 p2 ∈ M by

These representation operators are exactly the ones found in (section 19.1)
the discussion of the representation of E(2) corresponding to the quantum
free particle in two dimensions. There we saw that on position space wavefunctions this is just the representation induced from rotations of the position
space. It also comes from the Schrödinger representation, by taking a speciﬁc
quadratic combination of the Qj , Pj operators, the one corresponding to the
quadratic function l. Note that there is no ordering ambiguity in this case
since one does not multiply qj and pj with the same value of j. Also note that
for this SO(2) the double cover is trivial: As one goes around the circle in
SO(2) once, the operator UeθL is well deﬁned and returns to its initial value.
As far as this subgroup of Sp(4, R) is concerned, there is no need to consider
the double cover M p(4, R) to get a well-deﬁned representation.
The case of the group SO(2) ⊂ Sp(4, R) can be generalized to a larger
subgroup, the group GL(2, R) of all invertible linear transformations of R2 ,
performed simultaneously on position and momentum space. Replacing the
matrix L by

action on the position operators. Only in the case of an orthogonal action
(the SO(2) earlier) are these the same, with AT = −A.

20.3.2 An SO(2) action on the d = 1 phase space
Another sort of SO(2) action on phase space provides a d = 1 example that
mixes position and momentum coordinates. This will lead to quite non-trivial
intertwining operators, with an action on wavefunctions that does not come
about as an induced action from a group action on position space. This
example will be studied in much greater detail when we get to the theory of
the quantum harmonic oscillator, beginning with chapter 22. Such a physical
system is periodic in time, so the usual group R of time translations becomes
this SO(2), with the corresponding intertwining operators giving the time
evolution of the quantum states.
In this case, d = 1 and one has elements g ∈ SO(2) ⊂ Sp(2, R) acting on

Note that this is a diﬀerent calculation than in the spin case where we also
constructed a double cover of SO(2). Despite the diﬀerent context (SO(2)
acting on an inﬁnite dimensional state space), again one sees an aspect of
the double cover here, as either Ug or −Ug will give the same SO(2) rotation
action on the operators Q, P (while each having a diﬀerent action on the
states, to be worked out in chapter 24).
In our discussion here we have blithely assumed that the operator UL
can be exponentiated, but doing so turns out to be quite non-trivial. As
remarked earlier, this representation on wavefunctions does not arise as the
induced action from an action on position space. UL is (up to a factor of
i) the Hamiltonian operator for a quantum system that is not translation

268

invariant. It involves quadratic operators in both Q and P , so neither the
position space nor momentum space version of the Schrödinger representation
can be used to make the operator a multiplication operator. Further details
of the construction of the needed exponentiated operators will be given in
section 23.4.

20.3.3 The Fourier transform as an intertwining
operator
For another indication of the non-trivial nature of the intertwining operators of section 20.3.2, note that a group element g acting by a π2 rotation
of the d = 1 phase space interchanges the role of q and p. It turns out that
the corresponding intertwining operator Ug is closely related to the Fourier
π
transform F. Up to a phase factor ei 4 , Fourier transformation is just such
an intertwining operator: We will see in section 23.4 that, acting on wavefunctions,
π
Ue π2 L = ei 4 F
Squaring this gives

UeπL = (Ue π2 L )2 = iF 2

and we know from the deﬁnition of F and Fourier inversion that
F 2 ψ(q) = ψ(−q)
The non-trivial double cover here appears because
Ue2πL = −F 4 = −1
which takes a wavefunction ψ(q) to −ψ(q).

20.4 Representations of N  K, N
commutative
The representation theory of semi-direct products N  K will in general be
rather complicated. However, when N is commutative things simplify considerably, and in this section, we will survey some of the general features of
this case. The special cases of the Euclidean groups in 2 and 3 dimensions
were covered in chapter 19, and the Poincaré group case will be discussed in
chapter 42.

270

20 Representations of Semi-direct Products

For a general commutative group N , one does not have the simplifying feature of the Heisenberg group, the uniqueness of its irreducible representation.
On the other hand, while N will have many irreducible representations, they
are all one dimensional. As a result, the set of representations of N acquires
its own group structure, also commutative, and one can deﬁne:
 be the set
Definition (Character group). For N a commutative group, let N
of characters of N , i.e., functions
α:N →C
that satisfy the homomorphism property
α(n1 n2 ) = α(n1 )α(n2 )
 form a group, with multiplication
The elements of N
(α1 α2 )(n) = α1 (n)α2 (n)
When N is a Lie group, we will restrict attention to characters that are
diﬀerentiable functions on N . We only will actually need the case N = Rd ,
where we have already seen that the diﬀerentiable irreducible representations
are one dimensional and given by
αp (a) = eip·a
 = Rd , with elements
where a ∈ N . So the character group in this case is N
labeled by the vector p.
For a semi-direct product N  K, we will have an automorphism Φk of N
for each k ∈ K. From this action on N , we get an induced action on functions
 , by
on N , in particular on elements of N

To analyze representations (π, V ) of N  K, one can begin by restricting
attention to the N action, decomposing V into subspaces Vα where N acts
according to α. v ∈ V is in the subspace Vα when
π(n, 1)v = α(n)v
Acting by K will take this subspace to another one according to
Theorem.

v ∈ Vα =⇒ π(0, k)v ∈ VΦk (α)

Proof. Using the deﬁnition of the semi-direct product in chapter 18, one can
show that the group multiplication satisﬁes
(0, k −1 )(n, 1)(0, k) = (Φk−1 (n), 1)
Using this, one has
π(n, 1)π(0, k)v =π(0, k)π(0, k−1 )π(n, 1)π(0, k)v
=π(0, k)π(Φk−1 (n), 1)v

For each α ∈ N
 . From the above theorem, we see that if
which will give a subset Oα ⊂ N
Vα = 0, then we will also have Vβ = 0 for β ∈ Oα , so one piece of information
that characterizes a representation V is the set of orbits one gets in this way.
α also deﬁnes a subgroup Kα ⊂ K consisting of group elements whose
 leaves α invariant:
action on N
Definition (Stabilizer group or little group). The subgroup Kα ⊂ K of elements k ∈ K such that
 k (α) = α
Φ
 is called the stabilizer subgroup (by mathematicians) or
for a given α ∈ N
little subgroup (by physicists).
The group Kα will act on the subspace Vα , and this representation of Kα is a
second piece of information that can be used to characterize a representation.

272

20 Representations of Semi-direct Products

In the case of the Euclidean group E(2), we found that the nonzero orbits
Oα were circles and the groups Kα were trivial. For E(3), the nonzero orbits
were spheres, with Kα an SO(2) subgroup of SO(3) (one that varies with
α). In these cases, we found that our construction of representations of E(2)
or E(3) on spaces of solutions of the single-component Schrödinger equation
corresponded under Fourier transform to a representation on functions on the
orbits Oα . We also found in the E(3) case that using multiple-component
wavefunctions gave new representations corresponding to a choice of orbit
Oα and a choice of irreducible representation of Kα = SO(2). We did not
show this, but this construction gives an irreducible representation when
a single orbit Oα occurs (with a transitive K action), with an irreducible
representation of Kα on Vα .
We will not further pursue the general theory here, but one can show that
distinct irreducible representations of N  K will occur for each choice of an
orbit Oα and an irreducible representation of Kα . One way to construct these
representations is as the solution space of an appropriate wave equation, with
the wave equation corresponding to the eigenvalue equation for a Casimir
operator. In general, other “subsidiary conditions” then must be imposed to
pick out a subspace of solutions that gives an irreducible representation of
N  K; this corresponds to the existence of other Casimir operators. Another
part of the general theory has to do with the question of the unitarity of
representations produced in this way, which will require that one starts with
an irreducible representation of Kα that is unitary.

20.5 For further reading
For more on representations of semi-direct products, see section 3.8 of [84],
chapter 5 of [94], [9], and [39]. The general theory was developed by Mackey
during the late 1940s and 1950s, and his lecture notes on representation theory [58] are a good source for the details of this. The point of view taken here
that emphasizes constructing representations as solution spaces of diﬀerential
equations where the diﬀerential operators are Casimir operators, is explained
in more detail in [47].
The conventional derivation found in most physics textbooks of the operators UL coming from an inﬁnitesimal group action uses Lagrangian methods
and Noether’s theorem. The purely Hamiltonian method used here treats
conﬁguration and momentum variables on the same footing and is useful
especially in the case of group actions that mix them (such as the example
of section 20.3.2) For another treatment of these operators along the lines of
this chapter, see section 14 of [37].

For a concise but highly insightful discussion of the metaplectic representation, see chapters 16 and 17 in Graeme Segal’s section of [14]. For a discussion
of this topic emphasizing the role of the Fourier transform as an intertwining
operator, see [49]. The issue of the phase factor in the intertwining operators
and the metaplectic double cover will be discussed later in the context of
the harmonic oscillator, using a diﬀerent realization of the Heisenberg Lie
algebra representation. For a discussion of this in terms of the Schrödinger
representation, see part I of [56].

Chapter 21

Central Potentials and the
Hydrogen Atom

When the Hamiltonian function is invariant under rotations, we then expect
eigenspaces of the corresponding Hamiltonian operator to carry representations of SO(3). These spaces of eigenfunctions of a given energy break up into
irreducible representations of SO(3), and we have seen that these are labeled
by an integer l = 0, 1, 2, . . . and have dimension 2l + 1. This can be used
to ﬁnd properties of the solutions of the Schrödinger equation whenever one
has a rotation invariant potential energy. We will work out what happens
for the case of the Coulomb potential describing the hydrogen atom. This
speciﬁc case is exactly solvable because it has a second not-so-obvious SO(3)
symmetry, in addition to the one coming from rotations of R3 .

21.1 Quantum particle in a central
potential
In classical physics, to describe not free particles, but particles experiencing
some sort of force, one just needs to add a “potential energy” term to the
kinetic energy term in the expression for the energy (the Hamiltonian function). In one dimension, for potential energies that just depend on position,
one has
p2

for some function V (q). In the physical case of three dimensions, this will be

operator for a particle moving in a potential V (q1 , q2 , q3 ) will be

We will be interested in so-called “central potentials,” potential functions
that are functions only of q12 + q22 + q32 , and thus only depend upon r, the
radial distance to the origin. For such V , both terms in the Hamiltonian will
be SO(3) invariant, and eigenspaces of H will be representations of SO(3).
Using the expressions for the angular momentum operators in spherical
coordinates derived in chapter 8 (including equation 8.4 for the Casimir operator L2 ), one can show that the Laplacian has the following expression in
spherical coordinates

To solve the Schrödinger equation, we want to ﬁnd the eigenfunctions of

wavefunctions, leaving the radial coordinate invariant. To ﬁnd eigenfunctions

L2 acts with eigenvalue l(l + 1). For each solution glE (r), we will have the

ψ(r, θ, φ) = glE (r)Ylm (θ, φ)

will span a 2l + 1-dimensional (since m = −l, −l + 1, . . . , l − 1, l) space of
energy eigenfunctions for H of eigenvalue E.
For a general potential function V (r), exact solutions for the eigenvalues
E and corresponding functions glE (r) cannot be found in closed form. One
special case where we can ﬁnd such solutions is for the three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator, where V (r) = 12 mω 2 r2 . These are much more easily
found though using the creation and annihilation operator techniques to be
discussed in chapter 22.
The other well known and physically very important such case is the case
of a 1r potential, called the Coulomb potential. This describes a light charged
particle moving in the potential due to the electric ﬁeld of a much heavier
charged particle, a situation that corresponds closely to that of a hydrogen
atom. In this case, we have

The solutions to this equation can be found through a rather elaborate

E < 0, solutions correspond to an integer n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., with n ≥ l + 1. So,
for each n, we get n solutions, with l = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, all with the same

Figure 21.1: Energy eigenstates in the Coulomb potential.

The degeneracy in the energy values leads one to suspect that there is some
extra group action in the problem commuting with the Hamiltonian. If so, the
eigenspaces of energy eigenfunctions will come in irreducible representations
of some larger group than SO(3). If the representation of the larger group
is reducible when one restricts to the SO(3) subgroup, giving n copies of
the SO(3) representation of spin l, that would explain the pattern observed
here. In the next section, we will see that this is the case, and there use
representation theory to derive the above formula for En .

21.2 so(4) symmetry and the Coulomb
potential
The Coulomb potential problem is very special in that it has an additional
symmetry, of a non-obvious kind. This symmetry appears even in the classical
problem, where it is responsible for the relatively simple solution one can ﬁnd
to the essentially identical Kepler problem. This is the problem of ﬁnding the
classical trajectories for bodies orbiting around a central object exerting a
gravitational force, which also has a 1r potential.
Kepler’s second law for such motion comes from conservation of angular
momentum, which corresponds to the Poisson bracket relation
{lj , h} = 0
Here, we will take the Coulomb version of the Hamiltonian that we need for
the hydrogen atom problem
h=

e2
1
|p|2 −
2m
r

The relation {lj , h} = 0 can be read in two ways:
• The Hamiltonian h is invariant under the action of the group (SO(3))
whose inﬁnitesimal generators are lj .
• The components of the angular momentum (lj ) are invariant under the
action of the group (R of time translations) whose inﬁnitesimal generator is h, so the angular momentum is a conserved quantity.
For this special choice of Hamiltonian, there is a diﬀerent sort of conserved
quantity. This quantity is, like the angular momentum, a vector, often called
the Lenz (or sometimes Runge–Lenz, or even Laplace–Runge–Lenz) vector:
Definition (Lenz vector). The Lenz vector is the vector-valued function on
the phase space R6 given by
w=

1
q
(l × p) + e2
m
|q|

Simple manipulations of the cross product show that one has
l·w =0
We will not here explicitly calculate the various Poisson brackets involving
the components wj of w, since this is a long and unilluminating calculation,
but will just quote the results, which are

21.2

so(4) symmetry and the Coulomb potential

•

281

{wj , h} = 0
This says that, like the angular momentum, the vector with components
wj is a conserved quantity under time evolution of the system, and its
components generate symmetries of the classical system.

•

{lj , wk } = jkl wl
These relations say that the generators of the SO(3) symmetry act on
wj in the way one would expect for the components wj of a vector in
R3 .

•


{wj , wk } = jkl ll

−2h
m



This is the most surprising relation, and it has no simple geometrical
explanation (although one can change variables in the problem to try
and give it one). It expresses a highly non-trivial relationship between
the Hamiltonian h and the two sets of symmetries generated by the
vectors l, w.
The wj are cubic in the q and p variables, so the Groenewold–van Hove
no-go theorem implies that there is no consistent way to quantize this system
by ﬁnding operators Wj , Lj , H providing a representation of the Lie algebra
generated by the functions wj , lj , h (taking Poisson brackets). Away from the
locus h = 0 in phase space, the function h can be used to rescale the wj ,
deﬁning

−m
wj
kj =
2h
and the functions lj , kj then do generate a ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra.
Quantization of the system can be performed by ﬁnding appropriate operators
Wj , then rescaling them using the energy eigenvalue, giving operators Lj , Kj
that provide a representation of a ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra on energy
eigenspaces.
A choice of operators Wj that will work is
W=

1
Q
(L × P − P × L) + e2
2m
|Q|

where the last term is the operator of multiplication by e2 qj /|q|. By elaborate and unenlightening computations, the Wj can be shown to satisfy the
commutation relations corresponding to the Poisson bracket relations of the
wj :

as well as
L·W =W·L=0
The ﬁrst of these shows that energy eigenstates will be preserved not just
by the angular momentum operators Lj , but by a new set of non-trivial
operators, the Wj , so will be representations of a larger Lie algebra than
so(3). In addition, one has the following relation between W 2 , H and the
Casimir operator L2
W 2 = e4 1 +

If we now restrict attention to the subspace HE ⊂ H of energy eigenstates

On this subspace, equation 21.2 becomes the relation
2H(K 2 + L2 + 2 1) = −me4 1
and we will be able to use this to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of H in terms of those
of L2 and K 2 .
We will assume that E < 0, in which case we have the following commutation relations
[Lj , Lk ] = ijkl Ll
[Lj , Kk ] = ijkl Kl
[Kj , Kk ] = ijkl Ll

so(4) symmetry and the Coulomb potential

283

[Nj , Nk ] = ijkl Nl
[Mj , Nk ] = 0
This shows that we have two commuting copies of so(3) acting on states,
spanned, respectively, by the Mj and Nj , with two corresponding Casimir
operators M 2 and N 2 .
Using the fact that
L·K=K·L=0
one ﬁnds that

M2 = N2

Recall from our discussion of rotations in three dimensions that representations of so(3) = su(2) correspond to representations of Spin(3) = SU (2),
the double cover of SO(3) and the irreducible ones have dimension 2l + 1,
with l half-integral. Only for l integral does one get representations of SO(3),
and it is these that occur in the SO(3) representation on functions on R3 .
For four dimensions, we found that Spin(4), the double cover of SO(4),
is SU (2) × SU (2), and one thus has spin(4) = so(4) = su(2) × su(2) =
so(3) × so(3). This is exactly the Lie algebra we have found here, so one
can think of the Coulomb problem at a ﬁxed negative value of E as having an so(4) symmetry. The representations that will occur can include the
half-integral ones, since neither of the two so(3) factors is the so(3) of physical rotations in 3-space (the physical angular momentum operators are the
L = M + N).
The relation between the Hamiltonian and the Casimir operators M 2 and
2
N is
2H(K 2 + L2 + 2 1) = 2H(2M 2 + 2N 2 + 2 1) = 2H(4M 2 + 2 1) = −me4 1
On irreducible representations of so(3) of spin μ, we will have
M 2 = μ(μ + 1)2 1
for some half-integral μ, so we get the following equation for the energy
eigenvalues

same equation for the eigenvalues described earlier
En = −

284

21 Central Potentials and the Hydrogen Atom

One can show that the irreducible representations of the product Lie algebra so(3) × so(3) are tensor products of irreducible representations of the
factors, and in this case, the two factors in the tensor product are identical due to the equality of the Casimirs M 2 = N 2 . The dimension of the
so(3) × so(3) irreducibles is thus (2μ + 1)2 = n2 , explaining the multiplicity
of states one ﬁnds at energy eigenvalue En .
The states with E < 0 are called “bound states” and correspond physically to quantized particles that remain localized near the origin. If we had
chosen E > 0, our operators would have satisﬁed the relations for a different real Lie algebra, called so(3, 1), with quite diﬀerent properties. Such
states are called “scattering states,” corresponding to quantized particles that
behave as free particles far from the origin in the distant past, but have their
momentum direction changed by the Coulomb potential (the Hamiltonian is
non-translation invariant, so momentum is not conserved) as they propagate
in time.

21.3 The hydrogen atom
The Coulomb potential problem provides a good description of the quantum
physics of the hydrogen atom, but it is missing an important feature of that
system, the fact that electrons are spin 12 systems. To describe this, one really
needs to take as space of states two-component wavefunctions

|ψ =

ψ1 (q)
ψ2 (q)



(or, equivalently, replace our state space H of wavefunctions by the tensor
product H ⊗ C2 ) in a way that we will examine in detail in chapter 34.
The Hamiltonian operator for the hydrogen atom acts trivially on the
C2 factor, so the only eﬀect of the additional wavefunction component is
to double the number of energy eigenstates at each energy. Electrons are
fermions, so antisymmetry of multiparticle wavefunctions implies the Pauli
principle that states can only be occupied by a single particle. As a result,
one ﬁnds that when adding electrons to an atom described by the Coulomb
potential problem, the ﬁrst two ﬁll up the lowest Coulomb energy eigenstate
(the ψ100 or 1S state at n = 1), the next eight ﬁll up the n = 2 states (two
each for ψ200 , ψ211 , ψ210 , ψ21−1 ), etc. This goes a long ways toward explaining
the structure of the periodic table of elements.
When one puts a hydrogen atom in a constant magnetic ﬁeld B, for reasons
that will be described in section 45.3, the Hamiltonian acquires a term that
acts only on the C2 factor, of the form
2e
B·σ
mc

21.3

The hydrogen atom

285

This is exactly the sort of Hamiltonian we began our study of quantum
mechanics with for a simple two-state system. It causes a shift in energy
eigenvalues proportional to ±|B| for the two diﬀerent components of the
wavefunction, and the observation of this energy splitting makes clear the
necessity of treating the electron using the two-component formalism.

21.4 For further reading
This is a standard topic in all quantum mechanics books. For example, see
chapters 12 and 13 of [81]. The so(4) calculation is not in [81], but is in some
of the other such textbooks, a good example is chapter 7 of [5]. For extensive
discussion of the symmetries of the 1r potential problem, see [38] or [39].

Chapter 22

The Harmonic Oscillator

In this chapter, we will begin the study of the most important exactly
solvable physical system, the harmonic oscillator. Later chapters will discuss
extensions of the methods developed here to the case of fermionic oscillators,
as well as free quantum ﬁeld theories, which are harmonic oscillator systems
with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom.
For a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, the Stone–von Neumann theorem tells us that there is essentially just one way to non-trivially represent the (exponentiated) Heisenberg commutation relations as operators on
a quantum mechanical state space. We have seen two unitarily equivalent
constructions of these operators: the Schrödinger representation in terms
of functions on either coordinate space or momentum space. It turns out
that there is another class of quite diﬀerent constructions of these operators,
one that depends upon introducing complex coordinates on phase space and
then using properties of holomorphic functions. We will refer to this as the
Bargmann–Fock representation, although quite a few mathematicians have
had their name attached to it for one good reason or another (some of the
other names one sees are Friedrichs, Segal, Shale, Weil, as well as the descriptive terms “holomorphic” and “oscillator”).
Physically, the importance of this representation is that it diagonalizes
the Hamiltonian operator for a fundamental sort of quantum system: the
harmonic oscillator. In the Bargmann–Fock representation, the energy eigenstates of such a system are monomials, and energy eigenvalues are (up to
a half-integral constant) integers. These integers label the irreducible representations of the U (1) symmetry generated by the Hamiltonian, and they
can be interpreted as counting the number of “quanta” in the system. It
is the ubiquity of this example that justiﬁes the “quantum” in “quantum
mechanics.” The operators on the state space can be simply understood in
terms of so-called “annihilation” and “creation” operators which decrease or
increase by one the number of quanta.

22 The Harmonic Oscillator

22.1 The harmonic oscillator with one
degree of freedom
An even simpler case of a particle in a potential than the Coulomb potential
of Chapter 21 is the case of V (q) quadratic in q. This is also the lowest-order
approximation when one studies motion near a local minimum of an arbitrary
V (q), expanding V (q) in a power series around this point. We will write this
as
1
p2
+ mω 2 q 2
h=
2m 2
with coeﬃcients chosen so as to make ω the angular frequency of periodic
motion of the classical trajectories. These satisfy Hamilton’s equations
ṗ = −

∂V
= −mω 2 q,
∂q

so

q̇ =

p
m

q̈ = −ω 2 q

which will have solutions with periodic motion of angular frequency ω. These
solutions can be written as
q(t) = c+ eiωt + c− e−iωt
for c+ , c− ∈ C where, since q(t) must be real, we have c− = c+ . The space
of solutions of the equation of motion is thus two real dimensional, and
abstractly this can be thought of as the phase space of the system.
More conventionally, the phase space can be parametrized by initial values
that determine the classical trajectories, for instance by the position q(0) and
momentum p(0) at an initial time t(0). Since
p(t) = mq̇ = mc+ iωeiωt − mc− iωe−iωt = imω(c+ eiωt − c+ e−iωt )
we have
q(0) = c+ + c− = 2 Re(c+), p(0) = imω(c+ − c− ) = 2mω Im(c+ )
so

(although it is harder to show, it gives all of them). This also leads to a
new representation of the Heisenberg group (of course unitarily equivalent to
the Schrödinger one by the Stone–von Neumann theorem). Instead of working

The problem of ﬁnding eigenvectors and eigenvalues for H is seen to be
equivalent to the same problem for the operator
N = a† a
Such an operator satisﬁes the commutation relations
[N, a] = [a† a, a] = a† [a, a] + [a† , a]a = −a
and

[N, a† ] = a†

If |c is a normalized eigenvector of N with eigenvalue c, one has
c = c|a† a|c = |a|c|2 ≥ 0
so eigenvalues of N must be nonnegative. Using the commutation relations
of N, a, a† gives
N a|c = ([N, a] + aN )|c = a(N − 1)|c = (c − 1)a|c
and

N a† |c = ([N, a† ] + a† N )|c = a† (N + 1)|c = (c + 1)a† |c

292

22 The Harmonic Oscillator

This shows that a|c will have eigenvalue c − 1 for N , and a normalized
eigenfunction for N will be
1
|c − 1 = √ a|c
c
Similarly, since
|a† |c|2 = c|aa† |c = c|(N + 1)|c = c + 1
we have

If we start oﬀ with a state |0 that is a nonzero eigenvector for N with
eigenvalue 0, we see that the eigenvalues of N will be the nonnegative integers,
and for this reason N is called the “number operator.”
We can ﬁnd such a state by looking for solutions to
a|0 = 0
|0 will have energy eigenvalue 12 ω, and this will be the lowest energy
eigenstate. Acting by a† n-times on |0 gives states with energy eigenvalue

Taking q to

In the physical interpretation of this quantum system, the state |n, with
energy ω(n + 12 ), is thought of as a state describing n “quanta.” The state
|0 is the “vacuum state” with zero quanta, but still carrying a “zero-point”
energy of 12 ω. The operators a† and a have somewhat similar properties to
the raising and lowering operators we used for SU (2) but their commutator
is diﬀerent (the identity operator), leading to simpler behavior. In this case,
they are called “creation” and “annihilation” operators, respectively, due to
the way they change the number of quanta. The relation of such quanta to
physical particles like the photon is that quantization of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld (see Chapter 46) involves quantization of an inﬁnite collection of oscillators, with the quantum of an oscillator corresponding physically to a photon
with a speciﬁc momentum and polarization. This leads to a well-known problem of how to handle the inﬁnite vacuum energy corresponding to adding up
1
2 ω for each oscillator.
The ﬁrst few eigenfunctions are plotted below. The lowest energy eigenstate is a Gaussian centered at q = 0, with a Fourier transform that is also a
Gaussian centered at p = 0. Classically, the lowest energy solution is an oscillator at rest at its equilibrium point (q = p = 0), but for a quantum oscillator
one cannot have such a state with a well-deﬁned position and momentum.
Note that the plot gives the wavefunctions, which in this case are real and
can be negative. The square of this function is what has an interpretation as
the probability density for measuring a given position.

22.3 The Bargmann–Fock representation
Working with the operators a and a† and their commutation relation
[a, a† ] = 1
makes it clear that there is a simpler way to represent these operators than
the Schrödinger representation as operators on position space functions that
we have been using, while the Stone–von Neumann theorem assures us that
this will be unitarily equivalent to the Schrödinger representation. This representation appears in the literature under a large number of diﬀerent names,
depending on the context, all of which refer to the same representation:

ﬁnite. We will sometimes want to restrict to the subspace of ﬁnite linear
combinations of the |n, which we will denote F f in . This is the space C[z] of
polynomials, and F is its completion for the Bargmann–Fock norm.

Quantization by annihilation and creation operators

22.4 Quantization by annihilation
and creation operators
The introduction of annihilation and creation operators involves allowing
linear combinations of position and momentum operators with complex coefﬁcients. These can be thought of as giving a Lie algebra representation of
h3 ⊗ C, the complexiﬁed Heisenberg Lie algebra. This is the Lie algebra of
complex polynomials of degree zero and one on phase space M , with a basis
1, z, z. One has
h3 ⊗ C = (M ⊗ C) ⊕ C
with

1
1
z = √ (q − ip), z = √ (q + ip)
2
2

a basis for the complexiﬁed dual phase space M ⊗ C. Note that these coordinates provide a decomposition
M⊗C=C⊕C
of the complexiﬁed dual phase space into subspaces spanned by z and by z.
The Lie bracket is the Poisson bracket, extended by complex linearity. The
only nonzero bracket between basis elements is given by
{z, z} = i
Quantization by annihilation and creation operators produces a Lie algebra
representation by
Γ (1) = −i1, Γ (z) = −ia† , Γ (z) = −ia
with the operator relation

(22.5)

[a, a† ] = 1

equivalent to the Lie algebra homomorphism property
[Γ (z), Γ (z)] = Γ ({z, z})
We have now seen two diﬀerent unitarily equivalent realizations of this Lie

Note that while annihilation and creation operators give a representation
of the complexiﬁed Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 ⊗ C, this representation is
only unitary on the real Lie subalgebra h3 . This corresponds to the fact that
general complex linear combinations of a and a† are not self-adjoint, and to
get something self-adjoint one must take real linear combinations of
a + a† and i(a − a† )

22.5 For further reading
All quantum mechanics books should have a similar discussion of the harmonic oscillator, with a good example the detailed one in chapter 7 of Shankar
[81]. One source for a detailed treatment of the Bargmann–Fock representation is [26].

Chapter 23

Coherent States and the Propagator
for the Harmonic Oscillator

In Chapter 22 we found the energy eigenstates for the harmonic oscillator
using annihilation and creation operator methods and showed that these
give a new construction of the representation of the Heisenberg group on the
quantum mechanical state space, called the Bargmann–Fock representation.
This representation comes with a distinguished state, the state |0, and the
Heisenberg group action takes this state to a set of states known as “coherent
states.” These states are labeled by points of the phase space and provide the
closest analog possible in the quantum system of classical states (i.e., those
with a well-deﬁned value of position and momentum variables).
Coherent states also evolve in time very simply, with their time evolution
given just by the classical time evolution of the corresponding point in phase
space. This fact can be used to calculate relatively straightforwardly the
harmonic oscillator position space propagator, which gives the kernel for the
action of time evolution on position space wavefunctions.

23.1 Coherent states and the Heisenberg
group action
Since the Hamiltonian for the d = 1 harmonic oscillator does not commute
with the operators a or a† which give the representation of the Lie algebra
h3 on the state space F, the Heisenberg Lie group and its Lie algebra are not
symmetries of the system. Energy eigenstates do not break up into irreducible
representations of the group but rather the entire state space makes up such
an irreducible representation. The state space for the harmonic oscillator
does, however, have a distinguished state, the lowest energy state |0, and
one can ask what happens to this state under the Heisenberg group action.
Elements of the complexiﬁed Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 ⊗ C can be
written as

iαz + βz + γ
for α, β, γ in C (this choice of α simpliﬁes later formulas). The Lie algebra
h3 is the subspace of real functions, which will be those of the form
iαz − iαz + γ
for α ∈ C and γ ∈ R. The Lie algebra structure is given by the Poisson
bracket
{iα1 z − iα1 z + γ1 , iα2 z − iα2 z + γ2 } = 2Im(α1 α2 )
Here, h3 is identiﬁed with C ⊕ R, and elements can be written as pairs (α, γ),
with the Lie bracket
[(α1 , γ1 ), (α2 , γ2 )] = (0, 2Im(α1 α2 ))
This is just a variation on the labeling of h3 elements discussed in Chapter
13, and one can again use exponential coordinates and write elements of the
Heisenberg group H3 also as such pairs, with group law
(α1 , γ1 )(α2 , γ2 ) = (α1 + α2 , γ1 + γ2 + Im(α1 α2 ))
Quantizing using equation 22.5, one has a Lie algebra representation Γ ,
with operators for elements of h3
Γ (α, γ) = Γ (iαz − iαz + γ) = αa† − αa − iγ1

(23.1)

and exponentiating these will give the unitary representation
†

Γ(α, γ) = eαa −αa−iγ
We deﬁne operators

†

D(α) = eαa −αa
which satisfy (using Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ)
D(α1 )D(α2 ) = D(α1 + α2 )e−iIm(α1 α2 )
Then

Γ(α, γ) = D(α)e−iγ

and the operators Γ(α, γ) give a representation, since they satisfy
Γ(α1 , γ1 )Γ(α2 , γ2 ) = D(α1 + α2 )e−i(γ1 +γ2 +Im(α1 α2 )) = Γ((α1 , γ1 )(α2 , γ2 ))

is not a self-adjoint operator, and thus not an observable. Such states are,
however, very useful for describing certain sorts of physical phenomena, for
instance, the state of a laser beam, where (for each momentum component
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld) one does not have a deﬁnite number of photons,
but does have a deﬁnite amplitude and phase.
Digression (Spin coherent states). One can perform a similar construction
replacing the group H3 by the group SU (2), and the state |0 by a highest
weight vector of an irreducible representation (πn , V n = Cn+1 ) of spin n2 .
Writing | n2  for such a highest weight vector, we have

and we can create a family of spin coherent states by acting on | n2  by elements
of SU (2). If we identify states in this family that diﬀer only by a phase, the
states are parametrized by a sphere.
For the case n = 1, this is precisely the Bloch sphere
  construction of section

. In that case, all states
7.5, where we took as highest weight vector | 2  =
0
in the representation space C2 were spin coherent states (identifying states
that diﬀer only by scalar multiplication). For larger values of n, only a subset
of the states in Cn+1 will be spin coherent states.

23.2 Coherent states and the
Bargmann–Fock state space
One thing coherent states provide is an alternate complete set of norm one
vectors in H, so any state can be written in terms of them. However, these
states are not orthogonal (they are eigenvectors of a non-self-adjoint operator,
so the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators does not apply). The inner
product of two coherent states is

adapted to the Bargmann–Fock case. In the position space case, with states
functions of q, the delta-function distribution δ(q − q  ) provides an eigenvector |q   for the Q operator, with eigenvalue q  . As discussed in Chapter 12,
the position space wavefunction of a state |ψ can be thought of as given by
ψ(q) = q|ψ
with

q|q   = δ(q − q  )

In the Bargmann–Fock case, there is an analog of the distributional states

not normalizable. We deﬁne

To avoid confusion over the various ways in which complex variables z
and w appear here, note that this is just the analog of what happens in the
position space representation, where q is variously a coordinate on classical
phase space, an argument of a wavefunction, a label of a position operator
eigenstate, and a multiplication operator. The analog of the position operator
Q here is a† , which is multiplication by z (unlike Q, not self-adjoint). The
conjugate complex coordinate z is analogous to the momentum coordinate,
quantized to a diﬀerentiation operator. One confusing aspect of this formalism
is that complex conjugation takes elements of H (holomorphic functions) to
antiholomorphic functions, which are in a diﬀerent space. The quantization
of z is not the complex conjugate of z, but the adjoint operator.

23.3

The Heisenberg group action on operators

305

23.3 The Heisenberg group action on
operators
The representation operators
Γ(α, γ) = D(α)e−iγ
act not just on states, but also on operators, by the conjugation action
D(α)aD(α)−1 = a − α, D(α)a† D(α)−1 = a† − α
(on operators the phase factors cancel). These relations follow from the fact
that the commutation relations
[αa† − αa, a] = −α, [αa† − αa, a† ] = −α
are the derivatives with respect to t of
D(tα)aD(tα)−1 = a − tα, D(tα)a† D(tα)−1 = a† − tα

(23.8)

At t = 0, this is just equation 5.1, but it holds for all t since multiple commutators vanish.
We thus see that the Heisenberg group acts on annihilation and creation
operators by shifting the operators by a constant. The Heisenberg group
acts by automorphisms on its Lie algebra by the adjoint representation (see
section 15.5), and one can check that the Γ(α, γ) are intertwining operators
for this action (see Chapter 20). The constructions of this chapter can easily
be generalized from d = 1 to general values of the dimension d. For ﬁnite
values of d, the Γ(α, γ) act on states as an irreducible representation, as
required by the Stone–von Neumann theorem. We will see in Chapter 39
that in inﬁnite dimensions this is no longer necessarily the case.

23.4 The harmonic oscillator propagator
In section 12.5, we saw that for the free particle quantum system, energy
eigenstates were momentum eigenstates, and in the momentum space representation, time evolution by a time interval T was given by a kernel (see
equation 12.6)

tum eigenstates and diﬀerent methods are needed to compute the action of
the time evolution operator e−iHT .

Instead of the Schrödinger picture in which states evolve and operators
are constant, one can instead go to the Heisenberg picture (see section 7.3)
where states are constant and operators O evolve in time according to
d
O(t) = i[H, O(t)]
dt
with solution

O(t) = eitH O(0)e−itH

In the harmonic oscillator problem, we can express other operators in terms

The Hamiltonian operator is time invariant.

23.4

The harmonic oscillator propagator

307

Questions about time evolution now become questions about various products of annihilation and creation operators taken at various times, applied to
various Heisenberg picture states. Since an arbitrary state is given as a linear combination of states produced by repeatedly applying a† (0) to |0, such
problems can be reduced to evaluating expressions involving just the state |0,
with various creation and annihilation operators applied at diﬀerent times.
Nonzero results will come from terms involving
0|a(T )a† (0)|0 = e−iωT
which for T > 0 has an interpretation as an amplitude for the process of
adding one quantum to the lowest energy state at time t = 0, then removing
it at time t = T .

23.4.2 The coherent state propagator
One possible reason these states are given the name “coherent” is that they
remain coherent states as they evolve in time (for the harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian), with α evolving in time along a classical phase space trajectory.
If the state at t = 0 is a coherent state labeled by α0 (|ψ(0) = |α0 ), by 23.2,
at later times one has

23.5 The Bargmann transform
The Stone–von Neumann theorem implies the existence of:
Definition. Bargmann transform
There is a unitary map called the Bargmann transform
B : HS → F
intertwining the Schrödinger representation and the Bargmann–Fock representation, i.e., with operators satisfying the relation
ΓS (X) = B −1 ΓBF (X)B
for X ∈ h3 .
In practice, knowing B explicitly is often not needed, since the representation independent relation

can be used to express operators either purely in terms of a and a† , which
have a simple expression

The Metaplectic Representation
and Annihilation and Creation
Operators, d = 1

In section 22.4, we saw that annihilation and creation operators quantize
complexiﬁed coordinate functions z, z on phase space, giving a representation of the complexiﬁed Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 ⊗ C. In this chapter, we
will see what happens for quadratic combinations of the z, z, which after
quantization give quadratic combinations of the annihilation and creation
operators. These provide a Bargmann–Fock realization of the metaplectic
representation of sl(2, R), the representation which was studied in section
17.1 using the Schrödinger realization. Using annihilation and creation operators, the fact that the exponentiated quadratic operators act with a sign
ambiguity (requiring the introduction of a double cover of SL(2, R)) is easily
seen.
The metaplectic representation gives intertwining operators for the
SL(2, R) action by automorphisms of the Heisenberg group. The use of annihilation and creation operators to construct these operators introduces an
extra piece of structure, in particular picking out a distinguished subgroup
U (1) ⊂ SL(2, R). Linear transformations of the a, a† preserving the commutation relations (and thus acting as automorphisms of the Heisenberg Lie
algebra structure) are known to physicists as “Bogoliubov transformations.”
They are naturally described using a diﬀerent, isomorphic, form of the group
SL(2, R), a group of complex matrices denoted SU (1, 1).

Multiplying as usual by −i (to get a unitary representation of the real Lie

of h3 ⊗ C (see section 22.4) to an sl(2, C) representation can be deﬁned by

ΓBF (E − F ) = ΓBF (Z) = −i (a† a + aa† )
2
is a representation of sl(2, R), called the metaplectic representation.
Note that this is clearly a unitary representation, since all the operators are
skew-adjoint (using the fact that a and a† are each other’s adjoints).
This representation ΓBF on F will be unitarily equivalent using the
Bargmann transform (see section 23.5) to the Schrödinger representation ΓS
found earlier when quantizing q 2 , p2 , pq as operators on H = L2 (R). For many
purposes, it is, however, much easier to work with since it can be studied as
the state space of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which comes with a basis

316

24 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

of eigenvectors of the number operator a† a. The Lie algebra acts simply on
such eigenvectors by quadratic expressions in the annihilation and creation
operators.
One thing that can now easily be seen is that this representation ΓBF
does not integrate to give a representation of the group SL(2, R). If the Lie
algebra representation ΓBF comes from a Lie group representation ΓBF of
SL(2, R), we have


ΓBF (eθZ ) = eθΓBF (Z)
where

so
1

ΓBF (eθZ )|n = e−iθ(n+ 2 ) |n
Taking θ = 2π, this gives an inconsistency
ΓBF (1)|n = −|n
This is the same phenomenon ﬁrst described in the context of the Schrödinger
representation in section 17.1.
As remarked there, it is the same sort of problem we found when studying
the spinor representation of the Lie algebra so(3). Just as in that case, the
problem indicates that we need to consider not the group SL(2, R), but a
double cover, the metaplectic group M p(2, R). The behavior here is quite a
bit more subtle than in the Spin(3) double cover case, where Spin(3) was the
group SU (2), and topologically, the only non-trivial cover of SO(3) was the
Spin(3) one since π1 (SO(3)) = Z2 . Here π1 (SL(2, R)) = Z, and each extra
time one goes around the U (1) subgroup we are looking at, one gets a topologically diﬀerent non-contractible loop in the group. As a result, SL(2, R)
has lots of non-trivial covering groups, of which only one interests us, the
double cover M p(2, R). In particular, there is an inﬁnite-sheeted universal
R), but that plays no role here.
cover SL(2,
Digression. This group M p(2, R) is quite unusual in that it is a ﬁnite dimensional Lie group, but does not have any sort of description as a group of
ﬁnite dimensional matrices. This is due to the fact that all its ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations are the same as those of SL(2, R), which
has the same Lie algebra (these are representations on homogeneous polynomials in two variables, those ﬁrst studied in chapter 8, which are SL(2, C)
representations which can be restricted to SL(2, R)). These ﬁnite dimensional
representations factor through SL(2, R) so their matrices do not distinguish

24.1

The metaplectic representation for d = 1 in terms of a and a†

317

between two diﬀerent elements of M p(2, R) that correspond as SL(2, R)
elements.
There are no faithful ﬁnite dimensional representations of M p(2, R) itself
which could be used to identify M p(2, R) with a group of matrices. The only
faithful irreducible representation available is the inﬁnite dimensional one we
are studying. Note that the lack of a matrix description means that this is
a case where the deﬁnition we gave of a Lie algebra in terms of the matrix
exponential does not apply. The more general geometric deﬁnition of the Lie
algebra of a group in terms of the tangent space at the identity of the group
does apply, although to do this one really needs a construction of the double
cover M p(2, R), which is quite non-trivial and not done here. This is not a
problem for purely Lie algebra calculations, since the Lie algebras of M p(2, R)
and SL(2, R) can be identiﬁed.
Another aspect of the metaplectic representation that is relatively easy to
see in the Bargmann–Fock construction is that the state space F is not an
irreducible representation, but is the sum of two irreducible representations
F = Feven ⊕ Fodd
where Feven consists of the even functions of z, Fodd of odd functions of z.
On the subspace F f in ⊂ F of ﬁnite sums of the number eigenstates, these are
the even and odd degree polynomials. Since the generators of the Lie algebra representation are degree two combinations of annihilation and creation
operators, they will take even functions to even functions and odd to odd.
The separate irreducibility of these two pieces is due to the fact that (when
n and m have the same parity) one can get from state |n to any another |m
by repeated application of the Lie algebra representation operators.

24.2 Intertwining operators in terms
of a and a†
Recall from the discussion in chapter 20 that the metaplectic representation
of M p(2, R) can be understood in terms of intertwining operators that arise
due to the action of the group SL(2, R) as automorphisms of the Heisenberg
group H3 . Such intertwining operators can be constructed by exponentiating quadratic operators that have the commutation relations with the Q, P
operators that reﬂect the intertwining relations (see equation 20.3). These
quadratic operators provide the Lie algebra version of the metaplectic representation, discussed in section 24.1 using the Lie algebra sl(2, R), which is
identical to the Lie algebra of M p(2, R). In sections 20.3.2 and 20.3.4, these
representations were constructed explicitly for SO(2) and R subgroups of
SL(2, R) using quadratic combinations of the Q and P operators. Here, we

318

24 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

will do the same thing using annihilation and creation operators instead of
Q and P operators.
For the SO(2) subgroup of equation 24.1 (this is the same one discussed
in section 20.3.2), in terms of z and z coordinates, the moment map will be
μZ = zz

24.3 Implications of the choice of z, z
The deﬁnition of annihilation and creation operators requires making a speciﬁc choice, in our case

z = √ (q + ip), z = √ (q − ip)
2
2
for complexiﬁed coordinates on phase space, which after quantization becomes
the choice
1
1
a = √ (Q + iP ), a† = √ (Q − iP )
2
2
Besides the complexiﬁcation of coordinates on phase space M , the choice of
z introduces a new piece of structure into the problem. In chapter 26, we will
examine other possible consistent such choices, here will just point out the
various diﬀerent ways in which this extra structure appears.
• The Schrödinger representation of the Heisenberg group comes with no
particular distinguished state. The unitarily equivalent Bargmann–Fock
representation does come with a distinguished state, the constant function 1. It has zero eigenvalue for the number operator N = a† a, so can be
thought of as the state with zero “quanta,” or the “vacuum” state and
can be written |0. Such a constant function could also be characterized
(up to scalar multiplication), as the state that satisﬁes the condition
a|0 = 0
• The choice of coordinates z and z gives a distinguished choice of
Hamiltonian function, h = zz. After quantization, this corresponds to
a distinguished choice of Hamiltonian operator

24.3

Implications of the choice of z, z

321

With this choice the distinguished state |0 will be an eigenstate of H
with eigenvalue 12 .
• The choice of the coordinate z gives a decomposition
M⊗C=C⊕C

(24.10)

where the ﬁrst subspace C has basis vector z, the second subspace has
basis vector z.
• The decomposition 24.10 picks out a subgroup U (1) ⊂ SL(2, R), those
symplectic transformations that preserve the decomposition. In terms of
the coordinates z, z, the Lie bracket relations 16.15 giving the action of
sl(2, R) on M become

The only basis element of sl(2, R) does not mix the z and z coordinates
is zz. We saw (see equation 24.1) that upon exponentiation this basis
element gives the subgroup of SL(2, R) of matrices of the form


• Quantization of polynomials in z, z involves an operator ordering ambiguity since a and a† do not commute. This can be resolved by the following speciﬁc choice, one that depends on the choice of z and z:
Definition. Normal-ordered product
Given any product P of the a and a† operators, the normal-ordered product
of P , written :P : is given by reordering the product so that all factors a† are
on the left, all factors a on the right, for example
:a2 a† a(a† )3 : = (a† )4 a3
For the case of the Hamiltonian H, the normal-ordered version
1
:H: = : (aa† + a† a): = a† a
2

322

24 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

could be chosen. This has the advantage that it acts trivially on |0 and has
integer rather than half-integer eigenvalues on F. Upon exponentiation, one
gets a representation of U (1) with no sign ambiguity and thus, no need to
invoke a double covering. The disadvantage is that :H: gives a representation
of u(1) that does not extend to a representation of sl(2, R).

24.4 SU (1, 1) and Bogoliubov
transformations
Changing bases in complexiﬁed phase space from q, p to z, z changes the
group of linear transformations preserving the Poisson bracket from the group
SL(2, R) of real 2 by 2 matrices of determinant one to an isomorphic group
of complex 2 by 2 matrices. We have

when γ = β, δ = α, and |α|2 − |β|2 = 1.
Applied not to z, z but to their quantizations a, a† , such SU (1, 1) transformations are known to physicists as “Bogoliubov transformations.” One can
easily see that replacing the annihilation operator a by
a = αa + βa†
leads to operators with the same commutation relations when |α|2 − |β|2 = 1,
since
[a , (a )† ] = [αa + βa† , αa† + βa] = (|α|2 − |β|2 )1
By equation 24.11, the SO(2) ⊂ SL(2, R) subgroup of equation 24.1

Acting with this subgroup on the annihilation and creation operators just

operators

Such quadratic Hamiltonians that do not commute with the number operator
have lowest energy states |0r with indeﬁnite number eigenvalue. Examples
of this kind occur for instance in the theory of superﬂuidity.

24.5 For further reading
The metaplectic representation is not usually mentioned in the physics literature, and the discussions in the mathematical literature tend to be aimed at
an advanced audience. Two good examples of such detailed discussions can
be found in [26] and chapters 1 and 11 of [94]. To see how Bogoliubov transformations appear in the theory of superﬂuidity, see, for instance, chapter
10.3 of [86].

Chapter 25

The Metaplectic Representation
and Annihilation and Creation
Operators, arbitrary d

In this chapter, we will turn from the d = 1 case of chapter 24 to the general
case of arbitrary d. The choice of d annihilation and creation operators picks
out a distinguished subgroup U (d) ⊂ Sp(2d, R) of transformations that do
not mix annihilation and creation operators, and the metaplectic representation gives one a representation of a double cover of this group. We will
see that normal-ordering the products of annihilation and creation operators
turns this into a representation of U (d) itself (rather than the double cover).
In this way, a U (d) action on the ﬁnite dimensional phase space gives operators that provide an inﬁnite dimensional representation of U (d) on the state
space of the d-dimensional harmonic oscillator.
This method for turning unitary symmetries of the classical phase space
into unitary representations of the symmetry group on a quantum state space
is elaborated in great detail here not just because of its application to simple
quantum systems like the d-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but because it
will turn out to be fundamental in our later study of quantum ﬁeld theories.
In such theories the observables of interest will be operators of a Lie algebra
representation, built out of quadratic combinations of annihilation and creation operators. These arise from the construction in this chapter, applied to
a unitary group action on phase space (which in the quantum ﬁeld theory
case will be inﬁnite dimensional).
Studying the d-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator using these methods, we will see in detail how in the case d = 2 the group U (2) ⊂ Sp(4, R)
commutes with the Hamiltonian, so acts as symmetries preserving energy
eigenspaces on the harmonic oscillator state space. This gives the same construction of all SU (2) ⊂ U (2) irreducible representations that we studied in
chapter 8. The case d = 3 corresponds to the physical example of an isotropic
quadratic central potential in three dimensions, with the rotation group acting on the state space as an SO(3) subgroup of the subgroup U (3) ⊂ Sp(6, R)
of symmetries commuting with the Hamiltonian. This gives a construction of
angular momentum operators in terms of annihilation and creation operators.

25 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

25.1 Multiple degrees of freedom
Up until now we have been working with the simple case of one physical
degree of freedom, i.e., one pair (Q, P ) of position and momentum operators
satisfying the Heisenberg relation [Q, P ] = i1, or one pair of adjoint operators
a, a† satisfying [a, a† ] = 1. We can easily extend this to any number d of
degrees of freedom by taking tensor products of our state space F, and d
copies of our operators, each acting on a diﬀerent factor of the tensor product.
Our new state space will be
H = Fd = F ⊗ · · · ⊗ F



d times

and we will have operators
Qj , Pj j = 1, . . . , d
satisfying
[Qj , Pk ] = iδjk 1, [Qj , Qk ] = [Pj , Pk ] = 0
Here Qj and Pj act on the j’th term of the tensor product in the usual way,
and trivially on the other terms.
We deﬁne annihilation and creation operators then by
1
1
aj = √ (Qj + iPj ), a†j = √ (Qj − iPj ), j = 1, . . . , d
2
2
These satisfy:
Definition (Canonical commutation relations). The canonical commutation
relations (often abbreviated CCR) are
[aj , a†k ] = δjk 1, [aj , ak ] = [a†j , a†k ] = 0
In the Bargmann–Fock representation, H = Fd is the space of holomorphic
functions in d complex variables zj (with ﬁnite norm in the d-dimensional
version of 22.4) and we have
aj =

∂
, a†j = zj
∂zj

where one should keep in mind that each degree of freedom can be rescaled
separately, allowing diﬀerent parameters ωj for the diﬀerent degrees of freedom. The energy and number operator eigenstates will be written
|n1 , . . . , nd 
where

a†j aj |n1 , . . . , nd  = Nj |n1 , . . . , nd  = nj |n1 , . . . , nd 

For d = 3, the harmonic oscillator problem is an example of the central
potential problem described in chapter 21, and will be discussed in more
detail in section 25.4.2. It has an SO(3) symmetry, with angular momentum operators that commute with the Hamiltonian, and spaces of energy
eigenstates that can be organized into irreducible SO(3) representations. In
the Schrödinger representation states are in H = L2 (R3 ), described by wavefunctions that can be written in rectangular or spherical coordinates, and the
Hamiltonian is a second-order diﬀerential operator. In the Bargmann–Fock
representation, states in F3 are described by holomorphic functions of 3 complex variables, with operators given in terms of products of annihilation and
creation operators. The Hamiltonian is, up to a constant, just the number
operator, with energy eigenstates homogeneous polynomials (with eigenvalue
of the number operator their degree).
Either the Pj , Qj or the aj , a†j together with the identity operator will give
a representation of the Heisenberg Lie algebra h2d+1 on H, and by exponentiation a representation of the Heisenberg group H2d+1 . Quadratic combinations
of these operators will give a representation of the Lie algebra sp(2d, R), one
that exponentiates to the metaplectic representation of a double cover of
Sp(2d, R).

25.2 Complex coordinates on phase space
and U (d) ⊂ Sp(2d, R)
As in the d = 1 case, annihilation and creation operators can be thought of
as the quantization of complexiﬁed coordinates zj , z j on phase space, with
the standard choice given by
1
1
zj = √ (qj − ipj ), z j = √ (qj + ipj )
2
2
Such a choice of zj , z j gives a decomposition of the complexiﬁed Lie algebra
sp(2d, C) (as usual, the Lie bracket is the Poisson bracket) into three Lie
subalgebras as follows:

328

25 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

• A Lie subalgebra with basis elements zj zk . There are 12 (d2 + d) distinct
such basis elements. This is a commutative Lie subalgebra, since the
Poisson bracket of any two basis elements is zero.
• A Lie subalgebra with basis elements z j z k . Again, this has dimension
1 2
2 (d + d) and is a commutative Lie subalgebra.
• A Lie subalgebra with basis elements zj z k , which has dimension d2 .
Computing Poisson brackets one ﬁnds
{zj z k , zl z m } =zj {z k , zl z m } + z k {zj , zl z m }
= − izj z m δkl + izl z k δjm

(25.2)

In this chapter, we will focus on the third subalgebra and the operators that
arise by quantization of its elements.
Taking all complex linear combinations, this subalgebra can be identiﬁed
with the Lie algebra gl(d, C) of all d by d complex matrices. One can see this
by noting that if Ejk is the matrix with 1 at the j-th row and k-th column,
zeros elsewhere, one has
[Ejk , Elm ] = Ejm δkl − Elk δjm
and these provide a basis of gl(d, C). Identifying bases by
izj z k ↔ Ejk
gives the isomorphism of Lie algebras. This gl(d, C) is the complexiﬁcation
of u(d), the Lie algebra of the unitary group U (d). Elements of u(d) will
correspond to, equivalently, skew-adjoint matrices, or real linear combinations
of the quadratic functions
zj z k + z j zk , i(zj z k − z j zk )
on M .
In section 16.1.2, we saw that the moment map for the action of the symplectic group on phase space is just the identity map when we identify the Lie
algebra sp(2d, R) with order two homogeneous polynomials in the phase space
coordinates qj , pj . We can complexify and identify sp(2d, C) with complexvalued order two homogeneous polynomials which we write in terms of the
complexiﬁed coordinates zj , z j . The moment map is again the identity map,
and on the sub-Lie algebra we are concerned with, is explicitly given by
A ∈ gl(d, C) → μA = i


j,k

zj Ajk z k

(25.3)

25.2

Complex coordinates on phase space and U (d) ⊂ Sp(2d, R)

329

We can at the same time consider the complexiﬁcation of the Heisenberg Lie
algebra, using linear functions of zj and z j , with Poisson brackets between
these and the order two homogeneous functions giving a complexiﬁed version
of the derivation action of sp(2d, R) on h2d+1 .
We have (complexifying and restricting to gl(d, C) ⊂ sp(2d, C)) the following version of theorems 16.2 and 16.3
Theorem 25.1. The map of equation 25.3 is a Lie algebra homomorphism,
i.e.,
{μA , μA } = μ[A,A ]
The μA satisfy (for column vectors z with components z1 , . . . , zd )
{μA , z} = −Az,

{μA , z} = AT z

(25.4)

Proof. Using 25.2 one has

algebra sp(2d, R), and giving a unitary representation on the state space after

lies in this u(d) subalgebra (it is the case A = −i1), and its Poisson brackets with the rest of the subalgebra are zero. It gives a basis element of the
one-dimensional u(1) subalgebra that commutes with the rest of the u(d)
subalgebra.
While we are not entering here into the details of what happens for polynomials that are linear combinations of the zj zk and z j z k , it may be worth
noting one confusing point about these. Recall that in chapter 16, we found
the moment map μL = −q · Ap for elements L ∈ sp(2d, R) of the blockdiagonal form


A
0
0 −AT
where A is a real d by d matrix and so in gl(d, R). That block decomposition
corresponded to the decomposition of basis vectors of M into the two sets
qj and pj . Here we have complexiﬁed, and are working with respect to a
diﬀerent decomposition, that of basis vectors M ⊗ C into the two sets zj and
z j . The matrices A in this case are complex, skew-adjoint, and in a diﬀerent
non-isomorphic Lie subalgebra, u(d) rather than gl(d, R). For the simplest
example of this, d = 1, the distinction is between the R Lie subgroup of
SL(2, R) (see section 20.3.4), for which the moment map is
−qp = Im(z 2 ) =

1 2
(z − z 2 )

and the U (1) subgroup (see section 20.3.2), for which the moment map is

331

25.3 The metaplectic representation
and U (d) ⊂ Sp(2d, R)
Turning to the quantization problem, we would like to extend the discussion
of quantization of quadratic combinations of complex coordinates on phase
space from the d = 1 case of chapter 24 to the general case. For any j, k one
can take
z j z k → −iaj ak , zj zk → −ia†j a†k
There is no ambiguity in the quantization of the two subalgebras given by
pairs of the zj coordinates or pairs of the z j coordinates since creation operators commute with each other, and annihilation operators commute with
each other.
If j = k one can quantize by taking
zj z k → −ia†j ak = −iak a†j
and there is again no ordering ambiguity. If j = k, as in the d = 1 case there
is a choice to be made. One possibility is to take


1
1
zj z j → −i (aj a†j + a†j aj ) = −i a†j aj +
2
2
which will have the proper sp(2d, R) commutation relations (in particular
for commutators of a2j with (a†j )2 ), but require going to a double cover to
get a true representation of the group. The Bargmann–Fock construction
thus gives us a unitary representation of u(d) on Fock space Fd , but after
exponentiation this is a representation not of the group U (d), but of a double

cover we call U
(d).
One could instead quantize using normal-ordered operators, taking
zj z j → −ia†j aj
The deﬁnition of normal-ordering in section 24.3 generalizes simply, since
the order of annihilation and creation operators with diﬀerent values of j is
immaterial. Using this normal-ordered choice, the usual quantized operators
of the Bargmann–Fock representation are shifted by a scalar 12 for each j,
and after exponentiation the state space H = Fd provides a representation
of U (d), with no need for a double cover. As a u(d) representation however,
this does not extend to a representation of sp(2d, R), since commutation of
a2j with (a†j )2 can land one on the unshifted operators.
Since the normal-ordering does not change the commutation relations
obeyed by products of the form a†j ak , the quadratic expression for μA can

332

25 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

be quantized using normal-ordering and get quadratic combinations of the
aj , a†k with the same commutation relations as in theorem 25.1. Letting
UA =

 †
aj Ajk ak

(25.6)

j,k

we have
Theorem 25.2. For A ∈ gl(d, C) a d by d complex matrix

[UA , UA  ] = U[A,A
]

As a result

A ∈ gl(d, C) → UA

is a Lie algebra representation of gl(d, C) on H = C[z1 , . . . , zd ], the harmonic
oscillator state space in d degrees of freedom.
In addition (for column vectors a with components a1 , . . . , ad )
[UA , a† ] = AT a† , [UA , a] = −Aa

(25.7)


Proof. Essentially the same proof as 25.1.

For A ∈ u(d) the Lie algebra representation UA of u(d) exponentiates to
give a representation of U (d) on H = C[z1 , . . . , zd ] by operators


UeA = eUA
These satisfy
T

T

UeA a† (UeA )−1 = eA a† , UeA a(UeA )−1 = eA a

(25.8)

(the relations 25.7 are the derivative of these). This shows that the UeA
are intertwining operators for a U (d) action on annihilation and creation
operators that preserves the canonical commutation relations. Here the use
of normal-ordered operators means that UA is a representation of u(d) that
diﬀers by a constant from the metaplectic representation, and UeA diﬀers by a
phase-factor. This does not aﬀect the commutation relations with UA or the
conjugation action of UeA . The representation constructed this way diﬀers
in two ways from the metaplectic representation. It acts on the same space
H = Fd , but it is a true representation of U (d), no double cover is needed.
It also does not extend to a representation of the larger group Sp(2d, R).
The operators UA and UeA commute with the Hamiltonian operator for
the harmonic oscillator (the quantization of equation 25.5). For physicists
this is quite useful, as it provides a decomposition of energy eigenstates into

25.3

The metaplectic representation and U (d) ⊂ Sp(2d, R)

333

irreducible representations of U (d). For mathematicians, the quantum harmonic oscillator state space provides a construction of a large class of irreducible representations of U (d), by considering the energy eigenstates of a
given energy.

25.4 Examples in d = 2 and 3
25.4.1 Two degrees of freedom and SU (2)
In the case d = 2, the action of the group U (2) ⊂ Sp(4, R) discussed in
section 25.3 commutes with the standard harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian
and thus acts as symmetries on the quantum harmonic oscillator state space,
preserving energy eigenspaces. Restricting to the subgroup SU (2) ⊂ U (2),
we will see that we can recover our earlier (see section 8.2) construction
of SU (2) representations in terms of homogeneous polynomials, in a new
context. This use of the energy eigenstates of a two-dimensional harmonic
oscillator appears in the physics literature as the “Schwinger boson method”
for studying representations of SU (2).
The state space for the d = 2 Bargmann–Fock representation, restricting
to ﬁnite linear combinations of energy eigenstates, is
H = F2f in = C[z1 , z2 ]
the polynomials in two complex variables z1 , z2 . Recall from our SU (2) discussion that it was useful to organize these polynomials into ﬁnite dimensional
sets of homogeneous polynomials of degree n for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
H = H0 ⊕ H1 ⊕ H2 ⊕ · · ·
There are four annihilation or creation operators
a†1 = z1 , a†2 = z2 , a1 =

acting on H. These are the quantizations of complexiﬁed phase space coordinates z1 , z2 , z 1 , z 2 , with quantization the Bargmann–Fock construction of

ΓBF (1) = −i1, ΓBF (zj ) = −ia†j , ΓBF (z j ) = −iaj

334

25 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

Quadratic combinations of the creation and annihilation operators give
representations on H of three subalgebras of the complexiﬁcation sp(4, C) of
sp(4, R):
• A three-dimensional commutative Lie subalgebra spanned by z 1 z 2 , z 21 , z 22 ,
with quantization
ΓBF (z 1 z 2 ) = −ia1 a2 , ΓBF (z 21 ) = −ia21 , ΓBF (z 22 ) = −ia22
• A three-dimensional commutative Lie subalgebra spanned by z1 z2 , z12 , z22 ,
with quantization
ΓBF (z1 z2 ) = −ia†1 a†2 , ΓBF (z12 ) = −i(a†1 )2 , ΓBF (z22 ) = −i(a†2 )2
• A four-dimensional Lie subalgebra isomorphic to gl(2, C) with basis
z1 z 1 , z2 z 2 , z2 z 1 , z1 z 2
and quantization
i

ΓBF (z1 z 1 ) = − (a†1 a1 + a1 a†1 ), ΓBF (z2 z 2 ) = − (a†2 a2 + a2 a†2 )
2
2
ΓBF (z2 z 1 ) = −ia†2 a1 , ΓBF (z1 z 2 ) = −ia†1 a2
Real linear combinations of
z1 z 1 , z2 z 2 , z1 z 2 + z2 z 1 , i(z1 z 2 − z2 z 1 )
span the Lie algebra u(2) ⊂ sp(4, R), and ΓBF applied to these gives a
unitary Lie algebra representation by skew-adjoint operators.
Inside this last subalgebra, there is a distinguished element h = z1 z 1 +z2 z 2
that Poisson-commutes with the rest of the subalgebra (but not with elements
in the ﬁrst two subalgebras). Quantization of h gives the Hamiltonian operator
H=

This operator will multiply a homogeneous polynomial by its degree plus
one, so it acts by multiplication by n + 1 on Hn . Exponentiating this operator (multiplied by −i) one gets a representation of a U (1) subgroup of the
metaplectic cover M p(4, R). Taking instead the normal-ordered version
:H: = a†1 a1 + a†2 a2 = N1 + N2 = z1

∂
∂

25.4

Examples in d = 2 and 3

one gets a representation of a U (1) subgroup of Sp(4, R). Neither H nor :H:
commutes with operators coming from quantization of the ﬁrst two subalgebras. These will be linear combinations of pairs of either creation or annihilation operators, so will change the eigenvalue of H or :H: by ±2, mapping
Hn → Hn±2
and in particular taking |0 to either 0 or a state in H2 .
h is a basis element for the u(1) in u(2) = u(1) ⊕ su(2). For the su(2)
σ
part, on basis elements Xj = −i 2j the moment map 25.3 gives the following
quadratic polynomials
μX1 =

1
i
1
(z1 z 2 + z2 z 1 ), μX2 = (z2 z 1 − z1 z 2 ), μX3 = (z1 z 1 − z2 z 2 )
2
2
2

This relates two diﬀerent but isomorphic ways of describing su(2): as 2 by 2
matrices with Lie bracket the commutator, or as quadratic polynomials, with
Lie bracket the Poisson bracket.
Quantizing using the Bargmann–Fock representation give a representation
of su(2) on H
i
1
ΓBF (X1 ) = − (a†1 a2 + a†2 a1 ), ΓBF (X2 ) = (a†2 a1 − a†1 a2 )
2
2
i
ΓBF (X3 ) = − (a†1 a1 − a†2 a2 )
2
Comparing this to the representation π  of su(2) on homogeneous polynomials
discussed in chapter 8, one ﬁnds that ΓBF and π  are the same representation. The inner product that makes the representation unitary is the one of
equation 8.2. The Bargmann–Fock representation extends this SU (2) representation as a unitary representation to a much larger group (H5 M p(4, R)),
with all polynomials in z1 , z2 now making up a single irreducible representation of H5 .
The fact that we have an SU (2) group acting on the state space of the d = 2
harmonic oscillator and commuting with the action of the Hamiltonian H
means that energy eigenstates can be organized as irreducible representations
of SU (2). In particular, one sees that the space Hn of energy eigenstates of
energy n + 1 will be a single irreducible SU (2) representation, the spin n2
representation of dimension n + 1 (so n + 1 will be the multiplicity of energy
eigenstates of that energy).
Another physically interesting subgroup here is the SO(2) ⊂ SU (2) ⊂
Sp(4, R) consisting of simultaneous rotations in the position and momentum planes, which was studied in detail using the coordinates q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 in
section 20.3.1. There we found that the moment map was given by

336

25 The Metaplectic Representation and Annihilation and Creation . . .

μL = l = q1 p2 − q2 p1
and quantization by the Schrödinger representation gave a representation of
the Lie algebra so(2) with
UL = −i(Q1 P2 − Q2 P1 )
Note that this is a diﬀerent SO(2) action than the one with moment map
the Hamiltonian, it acts separately on positions and momenta rather than
mixing them.

Quantizing, the operator
UL = a†2 a1 − a†1 a2 = Γ (2X2 )
gives a unitary representation of so(2). The factor of two here reﬂects the
fact that exponentiation gives a representation of SO(2) ⊂ Sp(4, R), with no
need for a double cover.

25.4.2 Three degrees of freedom and SO(3)
The case d = 3 corresponds physically to the so-called “isotropic quantum
harmonic oscillator system,” and it is an example of the sort of central potential problem we studied in chapter 21 (since the potential just depends on
r2 = q12 + q22 + q32 ). For such problems, we saw that since the classical Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant, the quantum Hamiltonian will commute with
the action of SO(3) on wavefunctions, and energy eigenstates can be decomposed into irreducible representations of SO(3).
Here the Bargmann–Fock representation gives an action of H7  M p(6, R)
on the state space, with a U (3) subgroup commuting with the Hamiltonian

25.4

Examples in d = 2 and 3

(more precisely one has a double cover of U (3), but by normal-ordering one
can get an actual U (3)). The eigenvalue of the U (1) corresponding to the
Hamiltonian gives the energy of a state, and states of a given energy will be
sums of irreducible representations of SU (3). This works much like in the
d = 2 case, although here our irreducible representations are on the spaces
Hn of homogeneous polynomials of degree n in three variables rather than
two. These spaces have dimension 12 (n + 1)(n + 2). A diﬀerence with the
SU (2) case is that one does not get all irreducible representations of SU (3)
this way.
The rotation group SO(3) will be a subgroup of this U (3) and one can
ask how the SU (3) irreducible Hn decomposes into a sum of irreducibles of
the subgroup (which will be characterized by an integral spin l = 0, 1, 2, · · · ).
One can show that for even n one gets all even values of l from 0 to n, and
for odd n one gets all odd values of l from 1 to n. A derivation can be found
in some quantum mechanics textbooks, see, for example, pages 456–460 of
[60].
To construct the angular momentum operators in the Bargmann–Fock
representation, recall that in the Schrödinger representation these were
L1 = Q2 P3 − Q3 P2 , L2 = Q3 P1 − Q1 P3 , L3 = Q1 P2 − Q2 P1
and these operators can be rewritten in terms of annihilation and creation
operators. Alternatively, theorem 25.2 can be used, for Lie algebra basis elements lj ∈ so(3) ⊂ u(3) ⊂ gl(3, C) which are (see chapter 6)

This gives

Exponentiating these operators gives a representation of the rotation group
SO(3) on the state space F3 , commuting with the Hamiltonian, so acting
on energy eigenspaces (which will be the homogeneous polynomials of ﬁxed
degree).

25.5 Normal-ordering and the anomaly

To see that this normal-ordered version does not extend to sp(2d, R),
observe that basis elements of sp(2d, R) that are not in u(d) are the linear
combinations of zj zk and z j z k that correspond to real-valued functions. These
are given by
1
(Bjk zj zk + B jk z j z k )

normal-ordering ambiguity here, and quantization will give the unitary Lie

Exponentiating such operators will give operators which take the state |0 to
a distinct state (one not proportional to |0).
Using the canonical commutation relations one can show
[a†j a†k , al am ] = −al a†j δkm − al a†k δjm − a†j am δkl − a†k am δjl
and these relations can in turn be used to compute the commutator of two
such Lie algebra representation operators, with the result

The normal-ordered operators fail to give a Lie algebra homomorphism when
extended to sp(2d, R), but this failure is just by a constant term. Recall
from section 15.3 that even at the classical level, there was an ambiguity of
a constant in the choice of a moment map which in principle could lead to
an “anomaly,” a situation where the moment map failed to be a Lie algebra
homomorphism by a constant term. The situation here is that this potential
anomaly is removable, by the shift
A = UA + 1 tr(A)1
UA → U
2
which gives representation operators that satisfy the Lie algebra homomorphism property. We will see in chapter 39 that for an inﬁnite number of
degrees of freedom, the anomaly may not be removable, since the trace of the
operator A in that case may be divergent.

25.6 For further reading
The references from chapter 26 [26, 94] also contain the general case discussed
here. Given a U (d) ⊂ Sp(2d, R) action of phase space, the construction of
corresponding metaplectic representation operators using quadratic expressions in annihilation and creation operators is of fundamental importance
in quantum ﬁeld theory, where d is inﬁnite. This topic is, however, usually
not discussed in physics textbooks for the ﬁnite dimensional case. We will
encounter the quantum ﬁeld theory version in later chapters where it will be
examined in detail.

Chapter 26

Complex Structures
and Quantization

The Schrödinger representation ΓS of H2d+1 uses a speciﬁc choice of extra
structure on classical phase space: a decomposition of its coordinates into
positions qj and momenta pj . For the unitarily equivalent Bargmann–Fock
representation, a diﬀerent sort of extra structure is needed, a decomposition
of coordinates on phase space into complex coordinates zj and their complex
conjugates z j . Such a decomposition is called a “complex structure” J and
will correspond after quantization to a choice that distinguishes annihilation
and creation operators. In previous chapters, we used one particular standard choice J = J0 , but in this chapter will describe other possible choices.
For each such choice we will get a diﬀerent version ΓJ of the Bargmann–
Fock construction of a Heisenberg group representation. In later chapters on
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, we will see that the phenomenon of antiparticles is best understood in terms of a new possibility for the choice of J that
appears in that case.

26.1 Complex structures and phase space
Quantization of phase space M = R2d using the Schrödinger representation
gives a unitary Lie algebra representation ΓS of the Heisenberg Lie algebra
h2d+1 which takes the qj and pj coordinate functions on phase space to operators −iQj and −iPj on HS = L2 (Rd ). This involves a choice, that of taking
states to be functions of the qj , or (using the Fourier transform) of the pj .
It turns out to be a general phenomenon that quantization requires choosing
some extra structure on phase space, beyond the Poisson bracket.
For the case of the harmonic oscillator, we found in chapter 22 that quantization was most conveniently performed using annihilation and creation

operators, which involve a diﬀerent sort of choice of extra structure on phase
space. There we introduced complex coordinates on phase space, making the
choice
1
1
zj = √ (qj − ipj ), z j = √ (qj + ipj )
2
2
The zj were then quantized using creation operators a†j , the z j using annihilation operators aj . In the Bargmann–Fock representation, where the state
space is a space of functions of complex variables zj , we have
aj =

∂
, a†j = zj
∂zj

and there is a distinguished state, the constant function, which is annihilated
by all the aj .
In this section, we will introduce the notion of a complex structure on a
real vector space, with such structures characterizing the possible ways of
introducing complex coordinates zj , z j and thus annihilation and creation
operators. The abstract notion of a complex structure can be formalized as
follows. Given any real vector space V = Rn , we have seen that taking
complex linear combinations of vectors in V gives a complex vector space
V ⊗ C, the complexiﬁcation of V , and this can be identiﬁed with Cn , a real
vector space of twice the dimension. When n = 2d is even there is another
way to turn V = R2d into a complex vector space, by using the following
additional piece of information:
Definition (Complex structure). A complex structure on a real vector space
V is a linear operator
J :V →V
such that

J 2 = −1

Given such a pair (V = R2d , J) complex linear combinations of vectors in
V can be decomposed into those on which J acts as i and those on which it
acts as −i (since J 2 = −1, its eigenvalues must be ±i), so we have
V ⊗ C = VJ+ ⊕ VJ−
where VJ+ is the +i eigenspace of the operator J on V ⊗ C and VJ− is the −i
eigenspace. Note that we have extended the action of J on V to an action
on V ⊗ C using complex linearity. Complex conjugation takes elements of
VJ+ to VJ− and vice versa. The choice of J has thus given us two complex
vector spaces of complex dimension d, VJ+ and VJ− , related by this complex
conjugation.

26.1

Complex structures and phase space

343

Since
J(v − iJv) = i(v − iJv)
for any v ∈ V , the real vector space V can by identiﬁed with the complex
vector space VJ+ by the map
1
v ∈ V → √ (v − iJv) ∈ VJ+
2

(26.1)

The pair (V, J) can be thought of as giving V the structure of a complex
vector space, with J providing multiplication by i. Similarly, taking
1
v ∈ V → √ (v + iJv) ∈ VJ−
2

(26.2)

identiﬁes V with VJ− , with J now providing multiplication by −i. VJ+ and
VJ− are interchanged by changing the complex structure J to −J.
For the study of quantization, the real vector space we want to choose a
complex structure on is the dual phase space M = M ∗ , since it is elements
of this space that are in a Heisenberg algebra, and taken to operators by
quantization. There will be a decomposition
−
M ⊗ C = M+
J ⊕ MJ

and quantization will take elements of M+
J to linear combinations of creation
to
linear
combinations
of annihilation operators.
operators, elements of M−
J
The standard choice of complex structure is to take J = J0 , where J0 is
the linear operator that acts on coordinate basis vectors qj , pj of M by
J0 qj = pj , J0 pj = −qj
Making the choice
1
zj = √ (qj − ipj )
2
implies
1
J0 zj = √ (pj + iqj ) = izj
2
and the zj are basis elements (over the complex numbers) of M+
J0 . The complex conjugates
1
z j = √ (qj + ipj )
2
provide basis elements of M−
J0

344

26 Complex Structures and Quantization

With respect to the chosen basis qj , pj , the complex structure can be written as a matrix. For the case of J0 and for d = 1, on an arbitrary element of
M the action of J0 is
J0 (cq q + cp p) = cq p − cp q
so J0 in matrix form with respect to the basis (q, p) is

Note that, after complexifying, three diﬀerent ways to identify the original
M with a subspace of M ⊗ C are:
• M is identiﬁed with M+
J0 by equation 26.1, with basis element qj going
to zj , and pj to izj .
• M is identiﬁed with M−
J0 by equation 26.2, with basis element qj going
to z j , and pj to −iz j .

• M is identiﬁed with elements of M+
J0 ⊕ MJ0 that are invariant under

conjugation, with basis element qj going to √2 (zj +z j ) and pj to √i2 (zj −
z j ).

26.2 Compatible complex structures
and positivity
Our interest is in vector spaces M that come with a symplectic structure Ω,
a non-degenerate antisymmetric bilinear form. To successfully use a complex
structure J for quantization, it will turn out that it must be compatible with
Ω in the following sense:
Definition (Compatible complex structure). A complex structure on M is
said to be compatible with Ω if
Ω(Jv1 , Jv2 ) = Ω(v1 , v2 )

(26.5)

Equivalently, J ∈ Sp(2d, R), the group of linear transformations of M preserving Ω.

26.2

Compatible complex structures and positivity

345

The standard complex structure J = J0 is compatible with Ω, since (treating the d = 1 case, which generalizes easily, and using equations 16.2 and
26.3)

More simply, the matrix for J0 is obviously in SL(2, R) = Sp(2, R).
Note that elements g of the group Sp(2d, R) act on the set of compatible
complex structures by
(26.6)
J → gJg −1
This takes complex structures to complex structures since
(gJg −1 )(gJg −1 ) = gJ 2 g −1 = −1
and preserves the compatibility condition since, if J ∈ Sp(2d, R), so is gJg −1 .
A complex structure J can be characterized by the subgroup of Sp(2d, R)
that leaves it invariant, with the condition gJg −1 = J equivalent to the
commutativity condition gJ = Jg. For the case d = 1 and J = J0 , this

346

26 Complex Structures and Quantization

Other choices of J will correspond to other U (1) subgroups of SL(2, R), and
the space of compatible complex structures conjugate to J0 can be identiﬁed
with the coset space SL(2, R)/U (1). In higher dimensions, it turns out that
the subgroup of Sp(2d, R) that commutes with J0 is isomorphic to the unitary
group U (d), and the space of compatible complex structures conjugate to J0
is Sp(2d, R)/U (d).
Even before we choose a complex structure J, we can use Ω to deﬁne an
indeﬁnite Hermitian form on M ⊗ C by:
Definition (Indeﬁnite Hermitian form on M ⊗ C). For u1 , u2 ∈ M ⊗ C,
u1 , u2  = iΩ(u1 , u2 )

(26.7)

is an indefinite Hermitian form on M ⊗ C.
This is clearly antilinear in the ﬁrst variable, linear in the second, and satisﬁes
the Hermitian property, since
u2 , u1  = iΩ(u2 , u1 ) = −iΩ(u1 , u2 ) = iΩ(u1 , u2 ) = u1 , u2 
+
Restricting ·, · to M+
J and using the identiﬁcation 26.1 of M and MJ
+
·, · gives a complex-valued bilinear form on M. Any u ∈ MJ can be written
as
1
(26.8)
u = √ (v − iJv)
2

for some nonzero v ∈ M, so
u1 , u2  =iΩ(u1 , u2 )
1
=i Ω(v1 + iJv1 , v2 − iJv2 )
2
i
1
= (−Ω(Jv1 , v2 ) + Ω(v1 , Jv2 )) + (Ω(v1 , v2 ) + Ω(Jv1 , Jv2 ))
2
2
=Ω(v1 , Jv2 ) + iΩ(v1 , v2 )
(26.9)
where we have used compatibility of J and J 2 = −1 to get
Ω(Jv1 , v2 ) = Ω(J 2 v1 , Jv2 ) = −Ω(v1 , Jv2 )
We thus can recover Ω on M as the imaginary part of the form ·, ·.
This form ·, · is not positive or negative-deﬁnite on M ⊗ C. One can,
however, restrict attention to those J that give a positive-deﬁnite form on
M+
J:
Definition (Positive compatible complex structures). A complex structure
J on M is said to be positive and compatible with Ω if it satisfies the

26.2

Compatible complex structures and positivity

347

compatibility condition 26.5 (i.e., is in Sp(2d, R)) and one of the equivalent
(by equation 26.9) positivity conditions

for nonzero u ∈ M+
J . or

u, u = iΩ(u, u) > 0

(26.10)

Ω(v, Jv) > 0

(26.11)

for nonzero v ∈ M.
For such a J, ·, · restricted to M−
J will be negative-deﬁnite since
Ω(u, u) = −Ω(u, u)
−
and complex conjugation interchanges M+
J and MJ . The standard complex
structure J0 is positive since

zj , zk  = iΩ(z j , zk ) = i{z j , zk ) = δjk
and ·, · is thus the standard Hermitian form on M+
J0 for which the zj are
orthonormal.

26.3 Complex structures and quantization
Recall that the Heisenberg Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of linear and constant
functions on M , so can be thought of as
h2d+1 = M ⊕ R
where the R component is the constant functions. The Lie bracket is the
Poisson bracket. Complexifying gives
−
h2d+1 ⊗ C = (M ⊕ R) ⊗ C = (M ⊗ C) ⊕ C = M+
J ⊕ MJ ⊕ C

so elements of h2d+1 ⊗ C can be written as pairs (u, c) = (u+ + u− , c) where
−
−
u ∈ M ⊗ C, u+ ∈ M+
J , u ∈ MJ , c ∈ C

This complexiﬁed Lie algebra is still a Lie algebra, with the Lie bracket
relations
(26.12)
[(u1 , c1 ), (u2 , c2 )] = (0, Ω(u1 , u2 ))

348

26 Complex Structures and Quantization

and antisymmetric bilinear form Ω on M extended from the real Lie algebra
by complex linearity.
For each J, we would like to ﬁnd a quantization that takes elements of
−
M+
J to linear combinations of creation operators, elements of MJ to linear
combinations of annihilation operators. This will give a representation of the
complexiﬁed Lie algebra
ΓJ : (u, c) ∈ h2d+1 ⊗ C → ΓJ (u, c)
if it satisﬁes the Lie algebra homomorphism property
[ΓJ (u1 , c1 ), ΓJ (u2 , c2 )] = ΓJ ([(u1 , c1 ), (u2 , c2 )]) = ΓJ (0, Ω(u1 , u2 )) (26.13)
Since we can write
(u, c) = (u+ , 0) + (u− , 0) + (0, c)
−
−
where u+ ∈ M+
J and u ∈ MJ , we have

ΓJ (u, c) = ΓJ (u+ , 0) + ΓJ (u− , 0) + ΓJ (0, c)
Note that we only expect ΓJ to be a unitary representation (with ΓJ (u, c)
skew-adjoint operators) for (u, c) in the real Lie subalgebra h2d+1 (meaning
u+ = u− , c ∈ R).
For the case of J = J0 , the Lie algebra representation is given on basis
elements
−
zj ∈ M +
J0 , z j ∈ M J0
by
ΓJ0 (0, 1) = −i1, ΓJ0 (zj , 0) = −ia†j = −izj , ΓJ0 (z j , 0) = −iaj = −i

∂
∂zj

and is precisely the Bargmann–Fock representation ΓBF (see equation 22.5),
Note that the operators aj and a†j are not skew-adjoint, so ΓJ0 is not unitary
on the full Lie algebra h2d+1 ⊗ C, but only on the real subspace h2d+1 of real
linear combinations of qj , pj , 1.
For more general choices of J, we start by taking
ΓJ (0, c) = −ic1

(26.14)

which is chosen so that it commutes with all other operators of the representation, and for c real gives a skew-adjoint transformation and thus a unitary
representation. We would like to construct ΓJ (u+ , 0) as a linear combination

26.3

Complex structures and quantization

349

of creation operators and ΓJ (u− , 0) as a linear combination of annihilation
operators. The compatibility condition of equation 26.5 will ensure that the
+
+
ΓJ (u+ , 0) will commute, since if u+
1 , u2 ∈ MJ , by 26.13 we have
+
+
+
+
+


[ΓJ (u+
1 , 0), ΓJ (u2 , 0)] = ΓJ (0, Ω(u1 , u2 )) = −iΩ(u1 , u2 )1

and
+
+
+
+
+
+
+
Ω(u+
1 , u2 ) = Ω(Ju1 , Ju2 ) = Ω(iu1 , iu2 ) = −Ω(u1 , u2 ) = 0

The ΓJ (u− , 0) will commute with each other by essentially the same argument.
To see the necessity of the positivity condition 26.10 on J, recall that the
annihilation and creation operators satisfy (for d = 1)
[a, a† ] = 1
a condition which corresponds to
[−ia, −ia† ] = [ΓJ0 (z, 0), ΓJ0 (z, 0)] = ΓJ0 (0, {z, z}) = ΓJ0 (0, −i) = −1
Use of the opposite sign for the commutator would correspond to interchanging the role of a and a† , with the state |0 now satisfying a† |0 = 0 and no
state |ψ in the state space satisfying a|ψ = 0. In order to have a state |0
that is annihilated by all annihilation operators and a total number operator
with nonnegative eigenvalues (and thus a Hamiltonian with a positive energy
spectrum), we need all the commutators [aj , a†j ] to have the positive sign.
For any choice of a potential basis element u of M+
J , by 26.13 and 26.14
we have,
[ΓJ (u, 0), ΓJ (u, 0)] = ΓJ (0, Ω(u, u)) = −iΩ(u, u)1

(26.15)

and the positivity condition 26.10 on J will ensure that quantizing such an
element by a creation operator will give a representation with nonnegative
number operator eigenvalues. We have the following general result about the
Bargmann–Fock construction for suitable J:
Theorem. Given a positive compatible complex structure J on M, there is
a basis zjJ of M+
J such that a representation of h2d+1 ⊗ C, unitary for the
real subalgebra h2d+1 , is given by
ΓJ (zjJ , 0) = −ia†j , ΓJ (z Jj , 0) = −iaj , ΓJ (0, c) = −ic1
where aj , a†j satisfy the conventional commutation relations, and z Jj is the
complex conjugate of zjJ .

350

26 Complex Structures and Quantization

Proof. An outline of the construction goes as follows:
1. Deﬁne a positive inner product on M by (u, v)J = Ω(u, Jv) on M. By
Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization, there is a basis of span{qj } ⊂ M
consisting of d vectors qjJ satisfying
(qjJ , qkJ )J = δjk
2. The vectors JqjJ will also be orthonormal since
(JqjJ , JqkJ )J = Ω(JqjJ , J 2 qjJ ) = Ω(qjJ , JqjJ ) = (qjJ , qkJ )J
They will be orthogonal to the qjJ since
(JqjJ , qkJ )J = Ω(J 2 qjJ , qkJ ) = −Ω(qjJ , qkJ )
and Ω(qjJ , qkJ ) = 0 since any Poisson brackets of linear combinations
of the qj vanish.
3. Deﬁne

The zjJ give a complex basis of M+
J , their complex conjugates z j a

4. The operators
ΓJ (zjJ , 0) = −ia†j = −izj , ΓJ (z Jj , 0) = −iaj = −i

∂
∂zj

satisfy the desired commutation relations and give a unitary representation on linear combinations of the (zjJ , 0) and (z Jj , 0) in the real

26.4 Complex vector spaces with
Hermitian inner product as
phase spaces
In many cases of physical interest, the dual phase space M will be a complex
vector space with a Hermitian inner product. This will occur for instance
when M is a space of complex solutions to a ﬁeld equation, with examples non-relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory (see chapter 37) and the theory

26.4

of a relativistic complex scalar ﬁeld (see chapter 44.1.2). In such cases, the
Bargmann–Fock quantization can be confusing, since it involves complexifying M, which is already a complex vector space. One way to treat this
situation is as follows, taking M+
J = M. In the non-relativistic quantum
ﬁeld theory, this gives a consistent Bargmann–Fock quantization of the theory, while in the relativistic case it does not, and in that case a diﬀerent sort
of complex structure J is needed, one not related to the complex nature of
the ﬁeld values.
Instead of trying to complexify M, we introduce a conjugate complex
vector space M and an antilinear conjugation operation interchanging M
and M, with square the identity. In the case of M complex solutions to a
ﬁeld equation, M will be solutions to the complex conjugate equation. Then,
Bargmann–Fock quantization proceeds with the decomposition
M⊕M
playing the role of the decomposition
−
M+
J ⊕ MJ

in our previous discussion.
This determines J: It is the operator that is +i on M, and −i on M.
Given a Hermitian inner product ·, ·M on M, a symplectic structure Ω and
indeﬁnite Hermitian product ·, · on M ⊕ M can be determined as follows,
using the relation 26.7
u1 , u2  = iΩ(u1 , u2 )
Writing elements u1 , u2 ∈ M ⊕ M as

u1 = u+

26 Complex Structures and Quantization

Basis vectors zj of M orthonormal with respect to ·, ·M satisfy
zj , zk  = δjk
z j , z k  = −δjk
zj , z k  = z j , zk  = 0
The symplectic form Ω satisﬁes the usual Poisson bracket relation
Ω(zj , z k ) = {zj , z k } = iδjk
and one has all the elements needed for the standard Bargmann–Fock quantization. Note that the Hermitian inner product here is indeﬁnite, positive
on M, negative on M.
To understand better in a basis-independent way how quantization works
in this case of a complex dual phase space M, one can use the identiﬁcation (see section 9.6) of polynomials with symmetric tensor products. In this
case, polynomials in the zj get identiﬁed with S ∗ (M) (since zj ∈ M), while
polynomials in the z j get identiﬁed with S ∗ (M) (since z j ∈ M).
We see that the Fock space Fd gets identiﬁed with S ∗ (M), and using
this identiﬁcation (instead of the one with polynomials), one can ask what
operator gives the quantization of an element
u = u+ + u −
where u+ ∈ M and u− ∈ M. For basis elements zj ∈ M, the operator will
be −ia†j , while for z j ∈ M it will be −iaj . We will not enter here into details,
which would require more discussion of how to manipulate symmetric tensor
products (see, for instance, chapter 5.4 of [17]). One can show, however, that
the operators Γ (u+ , 0), Γ (u− , 0) deﬁned on symmetrized tensor products by
(where P + is the symmetrization operator of section 9.6)

26.5 Complex structures for d = 1
and squeezed states
To get a better understanding of what happens for other complex structures
than J0 , in this section we will examine the case d = 1. We can generalize
the choice J = J0 , where a basis of M+
J0 is given by
1
z = √ (q − ip)
2
by replacing the i by an arbitrary complex number τ . Then, the condition
−
that q − τ p be in M+
J and its conjugate in MJ is
J(q − τ p) = J(q) − τ J(p) = i(q − τ p)
J(q − τ p) = J(q) − τ J(p) = −i(q − τ p)
Subtracting and adding the two equations gives
J(p) = −

J(q) = −

and it can easily be checked that det J = 1, so J ∈ SL(2, R) and is compatible

gives a positive quadratic form. This will be the case when Im(τ ) > 0. We
have thus constructed a set of J that are positive, compatible with Ω, and
parametrized by an element τ of the upper half-plane, with J0 corresponding
to τ = i.

This will be a normalizable state for Im(τ ) > 0, again showing the necessity
of the positivity condition.
Eigenstates of Hτ for τ = ic, c > 0 real are known as “squeezed states”
in physics. By equation 26.20, the lowest energy state |0 will have spatial
dependence proportional to
1 2
e− 2c q
and higher energy eigenstates |n will also have such a Gaussian factor in their
position dependence. For c < 1, such states will have narrower spatial width
than conventional quanta (thus the name “squeezed”), but wider width in
momentum space. For c > 1 the opposite will be true. In some sense that we
will not try to make precise, the limits as c → ∞ and c → 0 correspond to the
Schrödinger representations in position and momentum space, respectively
(with the distinguished Bargmann–Fock state |0 approaching the constant
function in position or momentum space).

26.6 Complex structures and
Bargmann–Fock quantization
for arbitrary d
Generalizing from d = 1 to arbitrary d, the additional piece of structure
introduced by the method of annihilation and creation operators appears in
the following ways:
• As a choice of positive compatible complex structure J, or equivalently
a decomposition
−
M ⊗ C = M+
J ⊕ MJ
• As a division of the quantizations of elements of M ⊗ C into cre−
ation (coming from M+
J ) and annihilation (coming from MJ ) operators.
There will be a corresponding J-dependent deﬁnition of normal-ordering
of an operator O that is a product of such operators, symbolized by :O:J .
• As a distinguished vector |0J , the vector in H annihilated by all annihilation operators. Writing such a vector in the Schrödinger representation as a position space wavefunction in L2 (Rd ), it will be a Gaussian
function generalizing the d = 1 case of equation 26.20, with τ now a
symmetric matrix with positive-deﬁnite imaginary part. Such matrices
parametrize the space of positive compatible complex structures, a space
called the “Siegel upper half-space.”
• As a distinguished subgroup of Sp(2n, R), the subgroup that commutes
with J. This subgroup will be isomorphic to the group U (n). The Siegel
upper half-space of positive compatible complex structures can also be
described as the coset space Sp(2n, R)/U (n).

26.7 For further reading
For more detail on the space of positive compatible complex structures on
a symplectic vector space, see chapter 1.4 of [8]. Few quantum mechanics
textbooks discuss squeezed states, for one that does, see chapter 12 of [108].

Chapter 27

The Fermionic Oscillator

In this chapter, we will introduce a new quantum system by using a simple
variation on techniques we used to study the harmonic oscillator, that of
replacing commutators by anticommutators. This variant of the harmonic
oscillator will be called a “fermionic oscillator,” with the original sometimes
called a “bosonic oscillator.” The terminology of “boson” and “fermion” refers
to the principle enunciated in chapter 9 that multiple identical particles are
described by tensor product states that are either symmetric (bosons) or
antisymmetric (fermions).
The bosonic and fermionic oscillator systems are single-particle systems,
describing the energy states of a single particle, so the usage of the
bosonic/fermionic terminology is not obviously relevant. In later chapters, we
will study quantum ﬁeld theories, which can be treated as inﬁnite-dimensional
oscillator systems. In that context, multiple particle states will automatically
be symmetric or antisymmetric, depending on whether the ﬁeld theory is
treated as a bosonic or fermionic oscillator system, thus justifying the terminology.

2

that satisfy the so-called “canonical commutation relation” (CCR)
[aj , a†k ] = δjk 1, [aj , ak ] = [a†j , a†k ] = 0
The simple change in the harmonic oscillator problem that takes one from
bosons to fermions is the replacement of the bosonic annihilation and creation
operators (which we will now denote aB and aB † ) by fermionic annihilation
and creation operators called aF and aF † , and replacement of the commutator
[A, B] ≡ AB − BA
of operators by the anticommutator
[A, B]+ ≡ AB + BA
The commutation relations are now (for d = 1, a single degree of freedom)
[aF , a†F ]+ = 1, [aF , aF ]+ = 0, [a†F , a†F ]+ = 0
with the last two relations implying that a2F = 0 and (a†F )2 = 0
The fermionic number operator
NF = a†F aF
now satisﬁes

NF2 = a†F aF a†F aF = a†F (1 − a†F aF )aF = NF − a†F a2F = NF
2

(using the fact that a2F = a†F = 0). So one has
NF2 − NF = NF (NF − 1) = 0
which implies that the eigenvalues of NF are just 0 and 1. We will denote
eigenvectors with such eigenvalues by |0 and |1. The simplest representation
of the operators aF and a†F on a complex vector space HF will be on C2 , and

Note that the quantum system we have constructed here is nothing but

For the case of d degrees of freedom, one has this variant of the canonical
commutation relations (CCR) among the bosonic annihilation and creation
operators aB j and aB †j :
Definition (Canonical anticommutation relations). A set of 2d operators
aF j , aF †j , j = 1, . . . , d
is said to satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations (CAR) when one
has
[aF j , aF †k ]+ = δjk 1, [aF j , aF k ]+ = 0, [aF †j , aF †k ]+ = 0

While this sort of tensor product construction is useful for discussing the
physics of multiple qubits, in general it is easier to not work with large tensor
products, and the Cliﬀord algebra formalism we will describe in chapter 28
avoids this.
The number operators will be
NF j = aF †j aF j
These will commute with each other, so can be simultaneously diagonalized,
with eigenvalues nj = 0, 1. One can take as a basis of HF the 2d states
|n1 , n2 , · · · , nd 
which are the natural basis states for (C2 )⊗d given by d choices of either |0

As an example, for the case d = 3, the picture shows the pattern of states
and their energy levels for the bosonic and fermionic cases. In the bosonic
case, the lowest energy state is at positive energy and there are an inﬁnite
number of states of ever increasing energy. In the fermionic case, the lowest

which (up to the constant 12 that doesn’t contribute to commutation relations) is just UB for the case B = 1. Since this commutes with all other d by
d matrices, we have
[H, UA ] = 0
for all A ∈ gl(d, C), so these are symmetries, and we have a representation
of the Lie algebra gl(d, C) on each energy eigenspace. Only for A ∈ u(d) (A
a skew-adjoint matrix) will the representation turn out to be unitary.

27.3 For further reading
Most quantum ﬁeld theory books and a few quantum mechanics books contain some sort of discussion of the fermionic oscillator, see, for example,
chapter 21.3 of [81] or chapter 5 of [16]. The standard discussion often starts
with considering a form of classical analog using anticommuting “fermionic”

variables and then quantizing to get the fermionic oscillator. Here we are doing things in the opposite order, starting in this chapter with the quantized
oscillator, then considering the classical analog in chapter 30.

Chapter 28

Weyl and Cliﬀord Algebras

We have seen that just changing commutators to anticommutators takes the
harmonic oscillator quantum system to a very diﬀerent one (the fermionic
oscillator), with this new system having in many ways a parallel structure.
It turns out that this parallelism goes much deeper, with every aspect of the
harmonic oscillator story having a fermionic analog. We will begin in this
chapter by studying the operators of the corresponding quantum systems.

28.1 The Complex Weyl and Cliﬀord
algebras
In mathematics, a “ring” is a set with addition and multiplication laws that
are associative and distributive (but not necessarily commutative), and an
“algebra” is a ring that is also a vector space over some ﬁeld of scalars.
The canonical commutation and anticommutation relations deﬁne interesting
algebras, called the Weyl and Cliﬀord algebras, respectively. The case of
complex numbers as scalars is simplest, so we will start with that before
moving on to the real number case.

28.1.1 One degree of freedom, bosonic case
Starting with the one degree of freedom case (corresponding to two operators
Q, P , which is why the notation will have a 2), we can deﬁne:
Definition (Complex Weyl algebra, one degree of freedom). The complex
Weyl algebra in the one degree of freedom case is the algebra Weyl(2, C)
generated by the elements 1, aB , a†B , satisfying the canonical commutation
relations:

28 Weyl and Cliﬀord Algebras

[aB , a†B ] = 1, [aB , aB ] = [a†B , a†B ] = 0
In other words, Weyl(2, C) is the algebra one gets by taking arbitrary
products and complex linear combinations of the generators. By repeated
use of the commutation relation
aB a†B = 1 + a†B aB
any element of this algebra can be written as a sum of elements in normalorder, of the form
cl,m (a†B )l am
B
with all annihilation operators aB on the right, for some complex constants
cl,m . As a vector space over C, Weyl(2, C) is inﬁnite dimensional, with a
basis
1, aB , a†B , a2B , a†B aB , (a†B )2 , a3B , a†B a2B , (a†B )2 aB , (a†B )3 , . . .
This algebra is isomorphic to a more familiar one. Setting
a†B = z, aB =

d
dz

one sees that Weyl(2, C) can be identiﬁed with the algebra of polynomial
coeﬃcient diﬀerential operators on functions of a complex variable z. As a
complex vector space, the algebra is inﬁnite dimensional, with a basis of
elements

In our study of quantization by the Bargmann–Fock method, we saw that
the subset of such operators consisting of complex linear combinations of
1, z,

is closed under commutators, and is a representation of a Lie algebra of
complex dimension six. This Lie algebra includes as subalgebras the Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 ⊗ C (ﬁrst three elements) and the Lie algebra sl(2, C) =
sl(2, R) ⊗ C (last three elements). Note that here we are allowing complex
linear combinations, so we are getting the complexiﬁcation of the real sixdimensional Lie algebra that appeared in our study of quantization.
Since the aB and a†B are deﬁned in terms of P and Q, one could of
course also deﬁne the Weyl algebra as the one generated by 1, P, Q, with
the Heisenberg commutation relations, taking complex linear combinations
of all products of these operators.

28.1.2 One degree of freedom, fermionic case
Changing commutators to anticommutators, one gets a diﬀerent algebra, the
Cliﬀord algebra:
Definition (Complex Cliﬀord algebra, one degree of freedom). The complex
Cliﬀord algebra in the one degree of freedom case is the algebra Cliﬀ(2, C)
generated by the elements 1, aF , a†F , subject to the canonical anticommutation
relations (CAR)
[aF , a†F ]+ = 1, [aF , aF ]+ = [a†F , a†F ]+ = 0
This algebra is a four-dimensional algebra over C, with basis
1, aF , a†F , a†F aF
since higher powers of the operators vanish, and the anticommutation relation
between aF and a†F can be used to normal-order and put factors of aF on the
right. We saw in chapter 27 that this algebra is isomorphic with the algebra
M (2, C) of 2 by 2 complex matrices, using

We will see in chapter 30 that there is also a way of identifying this algebra with “diﬀerential operators in fermionic variables,” analogous to what
happens in the bosonic (Weyl algebra) case.
Recall that the bosonic annihilation and creation operators were originally
deﬁned in terms of the P and Q operators by
1
1
aB = √ (Q + iP ), a†B = √ (Q − iP )
2
2
Looking for the fermionic analogs of the operators Q and P , we use a slightly
diﬀerent normalization, and set
aF =

1
1
(γ1 + iγ2 ), a†F = (γ1 − iγ2 )
2
2

so
γ1 = aF + a†F , γ2 =

1
(aF − a†F )
i

and the CAR imply that the operators γj satisfy the anticommutation relations

368

28 Weyl and Cliﬀord Algebras

[γ1 , γ1 ]+ = [aF + a†F , aF + a†F ]+ = 2
[γ2 , γ2 ]+ = −[aF − a†F , aF − a†F ]+ = 2
[γ1 , γ2 ]+ =

1
[aF + a†F , aF − a†F ]+ = 0
i

From this, we see that
• One could alternatively have deﬁned Cliﬀ(2, C) as the algebra generated
by 1, γ1 , γ2 , subject to the relations
[γj , γk ]+ = 2δjk
• Using just the generators 1 and γ1 , one gets an algebra Cliﬀ(1, C), generated by 1, γ1 , with the relation
γ12 = 1
This is a two-dimensional complex algebra, isomorphic to C ⊕ C.

28.1.3 Multiple degrees of freedom
For a larger number of degrees of freedom, one can generalize the above and
deﬁne Weyl and Cliﬀord algebras as follows:
Definition (Complex Weyl algebras). The complex Weyl algebra for d
degrees of freedom is the algebra Weyl(2d, C) generated by the elements
1, aB j , aB †j , j = 1, . . . , d satisfying the CCR
[aB j , aB †k ] = δjk 1, [aB j , aB k ] = [aB †j , aB †k ] = 0
Weyl(2d, C) can be identiﬁed with the algebra of polynomial coeﬃcient
diﬀerential operators in d complex variables z1 , z2 , . . . , zd . The subspace of
complex linear combinations of the elements
1, zj ,

∂
∂
∂2
, zj zk ,
, zj
∂zj
∂zj ∂zk
∂zk

is closed under commutators and provides a representation of the complexiﬁcation of the Lie algebra h2d+1  sp(2d, R) built out of the Heisenberg Lie
algebra for d degrees of freedom and the Lie algebra of the symplectic group
Sp(2d, R). Recall that this is the Lie algebra of polynomials of degree at
most 2 on the phase space R2d , with the Poisson bracket as Lie bracket.

28.1

The Complex Weyl and Cliﬀord algebras

The complex Weyl algebra could also be deﬁned by taking complex linear
combinations of products of generators 1, Pj , Qj , subject to the Heisenberg
commutation relations.
For Cliﬀord algebras, one has:
Definition (Complex Cliﬀord algebras, using annihilation and creation operators). The complex Cliﬀord algebra for d degrees of freedom is the algebra
Cliﬀ(2d, C) generated by 1, aF j , aF †j for j = 1, 2, . . . , d satisfying the CAR
[aF j , aF †k ]+ = δjk 1, [aF j , aF k ]+ = [aF †j , aF †k ]+ = 0
or, alternatively, one has the following more general deﬁnition that also works
in the odd-dimensional case:
Definition (Complex Cliﬀord algebras). The complex Cliﬀord algebra in n
variables is the algebra Cliﬀ(n, C) generated by 1, γj for j = 1, 2, . . . , n satisfying the relations
[γj , γk ]+ = 2δjk
We will not try and prove this here, but one can show that, abstractly
as algebras, the complex Cliﬀord algebras are something well known. Generalizing the case d = 1 where we saw that Cliﬀ(2, C) was isomorphic to the
algebra of 2 by 2 complex matrices, one has isomorphisms
Cliﬀ(2d, C) ↔ M (2d , C)
in the even-dimensional case, and in the odd-dimensional case
Cliﬀ(2d + 1, C) ↔ M (2d , C) ⊕ M (2d , C)
Two properties of Cliﬀ(n, C) are
• As a vector space over C, a basis of Cliﬀ(n, C) is the set of elements
1, γj , γj γk , γj γk γl , . . . , γ1 γ2 γ3 · · · γn−1 γn
for indices j, k, l, · · · ∈ 1, 2, . . . , n, with j < k < l < · · · . To show this,
consider all products of the generators, and use the commutation relations for the γj to identify any such product with an element of this
basis. The relation γj2 = 1 shows that repeated occurrences of a γj can
be removed. The relation γj γk = −γk γj can then be used to put elements
of the product in the order of a basis element as above.
• As a vector space over C, Cliﬀ(n, C) has dimension 2n . One way to see
this is to consider the product

370

28 Weyl and Cliﬀord Algebras

(1 + γ1 )(1 + γ2 ) · · · (1 + γn )
which will have 2n terms that are exactly those of the basis listed above.

28.2 Real Cliﬀord algebras
We can deﬁne real Cliﬀord algebras Cliﬀ(n, R) just as for the complex case,
by taking only real linear combinations:
Definition (Real Cliﬀord algebras). The real Cliﬀord algebra in n variables
is the algebra Cliﬀ(n, R) generated over the real numbers by 1, γj for j =
1, 2, . . . , n satisfying the relations
[γj , γk ]+ = 2δjk
For reasons that will be explained in the next chapter, it turns out that
a more general deﬁnition is useful. We write the number of variables as n =
r + s, for r, s nonnegative integers, and now vary not just r + s, but also r − s,
the so-called “signature”:
Definition (Real Cliﬀord algebras, arbitrary signature). The real Cliﬀord
algebra in n = r+s variables is the algebra Cliﬀ(r, s, R) over the real numbers
generated by 1, γj for j = 1, 2, . . . , n satisfying the relations
[γj , γk ]+ = ±2δjk 1
where we choose the + sign when j = k = 1, . . . , r and the − sign when
j = k = r + 1, . . . , n.
In other words, as in the complex case, diﬀerent γj anticommute, but only
the ﬁrst r of them satisfy γj2 = 1, with the other s of them satisfying γj2 = −1.
Working out some of the low-dimensional examples, one ﬁnds:
• Cliﬀ(0, 1, R). This has generators 1 and γ1 , satisfying
γ12 = −1
Taking real linear combinations of these two generators, the algebra one
gets is √
just the algebra C of complex numbers, with γ1 playing the role
of i = −1.
• Cliﬀ(0, 2, R). This has generators 1, γ1 , γ2 and a basis
1, γ1 , γ2 , γ1 γ2

with
γ12 = −1, γ22 = −1, (γ1 γ2 )2 = γ1 γ2 γ1 γ2 = −γ12 γ22 = −1
This four-dimensional algebra over the real numbers can be identiﬁed
with the algebra H of quaternions by taking
γ1 ↔ i, γ2 ↔ j, γ1 γ2 ↔ k
• Cliﬀ(1, 1, R). This is the algebra M (2, R) of real 2 by 2 matrices, with

since these are represented as real matrices.

It turns out that Cliﬀ(r, s, R) is always one or two copies of matrices of
real, complex, or quaternionic elements, of dimension a power of 2, but this
requires a rather intricate algebraic argument that we will not enter into here.
For the details of this and the resulting pattern of algebras one gets, see, for

372

28 Weyl and Cliﬀord Algebras

instance, [55]. One special case where the pattern is relatively simple is when
one has r = s. Then, n = 2r is even-dimensional and one ﬁnds
Cliﬀ(r, r, R) = M (2r , R)

28.3 For further reading
A good source for more details about Cliﬀord algebras and spinors is
chapter 12 of the representation theory textbook [94]. For the details of what
happens for all Cliﬀ(r, s, R), another good source is chapter 1 of [55].

Chapter 29

Cliﬀord Algebras and Geometry

The deﬁnitions given in chapter 28 of Weyl and Cliﬀord algebras were purely
algebraic, based on a choice of generators and relations. These deﬁnitions do
though have a more geometrical formulation, with the deﬁnition in terms of
generators corresponding to a speciﬁc choice of coordinates. For the Weyl
algebra, the geometry involved is symplectic geometry, based on a nondegenerate antisymmetric bilinear form. We have already seen that in the
bosonic case quantization of a phase space R2d depends on the choice of a
non-degenerate antisymmetric bilinear form Ω which determines the Poisson brackets and thus the Heisenberg commutation relations. Such a Ω also
determines a group Sp(2d, R), which is the group of linear transformations
of R2d preserving Ω.
The Cliﬀord algebra also has a coordinate invariant deﬁnition, based on
a more well-known structure on a vector space Rn , that of a non-degenerate
symmetric bilinear form, i.e., an inner product. In this case, the group that
preserves the inner product is an orthogonal group. In the symplectic case,
antisymmetric forms require an even number of dimensions, but this is not
true for symmetric forms, which also exist in odd dimensions.

29.1 Non-degenerate bilinear forms
In the case of M = R2d , the dual phase space, the Poisson bracket determines
an antisymmetric bilinear form on M, which, for a basis qj , pj and two vectors
u, u ∈ M
u = cq1 q1 + cp1 p1 + · · · + cqd qd + cpd pd ∈ M
u = cq1 q1 + cp1 p1 + · · · + cqd qd + cpd pd ∈ M

make up the group Sp(2d, R) and preserve Ω, satisfying
Ω(gu, gu ) = Ω(u, u )
This choice of Ω is much less arbitrary than it looks. One can show that
given any non-degenerate antisymmetric bilinear form on R2d a basis can be
found with respect to which it will be the Ω given here (for a proof, see [8]).
This is also true if one complexiﬁes R2d , using the same formula for Ω, which
is now a bilinear form on C2d . In the real case, the group that preserves Ω is
called Sp(2d, R), in the complex case Sp(2d, C).
To get a fermionic analog of this, all one needs to do is replace “nondegenerate antisymmetric bilinear form Ω(·, ·)” with “non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form (·, ·).” Such a symmetric bilinear form is actually something much more familiar from geometry than the antisymmetric case analog:
It is just a notion of inner product. Two things are diﬀerent in the symmetric
case:
• The underlying vector space does not have to be even dimensional, one
can take M = Rn for any n, including n odd. To get a detailed analog of
the bosonic case though, we will need to consider the even case n = 2d.
• For a given dimension n, there is not just one possible choice of (·, ·) up
to change of basis, but one possible choice for each pair of nonnegative
integers r, s such that r + s = n. Given r, s, any choice of (·, ·) can be
put in the form

SO(r, s, R) ⊂ O(r, s, R) is the subgroup of matrices of determinant +1.
If one complexiﬁes, taking components of vectors to be in Cn , using the
same formula for (·, ·), one can change basis by multiplying the s basis elements by a factor of i, and in this new basis all basis vectors ej satisfy
(ej , ej ) = 1. One thus sees that on Cn , as in the symplectic case, up to
change of basis there is only one non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form.
The group preserving this is called O(n, C). Note that on Cn (·, ·) is not the
Hermitian inner product (which is antilinear on the ﬁrst variable), and it is
not positive deﬁnite.

29.2 Cliﬀord algebras and geometry
As deﬁned by generators in the last chapter, Cliﬀord algebras have no obvious
geometrical signiﬁcance. It turns out, however, that they are powerful tools
in the study of the geometry of linear spaces with an inner product, including

376

29 Cliﬀord Algebras and Geometry

especially the study of linear transformations that preserve the inner product,
i.e., rotations. To see the relation between Cliﬀord algebras and geometry,
consider ﬁrst the positive-deﬁnite case Cliﬀ(n, R). To an arbitrary vector
v = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vn ) ∈ Rn
we associate the Cliﬀord algebra element v
/ = γ(v) where γ is the map
v ∈ Rn → γ(v) = v1 γ1 + v2 γ2 + · · · + vn γn ∈ Cliﬀ(n, R)

(29.1)

Using the Cliﬀord algebra relations for the γj , given two vectors v, w the
product of their associated Cliﬀord algebra elements satisﬁes
v
/w
/ + w/
/ v = [v1 γ1 + v2 γ2 + · · · + vn γn , w1 γ1 + w2 γ2 + · · · + wn γn ]+
= 2(v1 w1 + v2 w2 + · · · + vn wn )
= 2(v, w)

(29.2)

where (·, ·) is the symmetric bilinear form on Rn corresponding to the standard inner product of vectors. Note that taking v = w one has
2
v
/ = (v, v) = ||v||2

The Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(n, R) thus contains Rn as the subspace of linear
combinations of the generators γj . It can be thought of as a sort of enhancement of the vector space Rn that encodes information about the inner product, and it will sometimes be written Cliﬀ(Rn , (·, ·)). In this larger structure
vectors can be multiplied as well as added, with the multiplication determined by the inner product and given by equation 29.2. Note that diﬀerent
people use diﬀerent conventions, with
v
/w
/ + w/
/ v = −2(v, w)
another common choice. One also sees variants without the factor of 2.
For n-dimensional vector spaces over C, we have seen that for any nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form a basis can be found such that (·, ·) has
the standard form
(z, w) = z1 w1 + z2 w2 + · · · + zn wn
As a result, up to isomorphism, there is just one complex Cliﬀord algebra
in dimension n, the one we deﬁned as Cliﬀ(n, C). For n-dimensional vector
spaces over R with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form of type r, s
such that r + s = n, the corresponding Cliﬀord algebras Cliﬀ(r, s, R) are the
ones deﬁned in terms of generators in section 28.2.

29.2

Cliﬀord algebras and geometry

In special relativity, space–time is a real four-dimensional vector space
with an indeﬁnite inner product corresponding to (depending on one’s choice
of convention) either the case r = 1, s = 3 or the case r = 3, s = 1. The group
of linear transformations preserving this inner product is called the Lorentz
group, and its orientation preserving component is written as SO(3, 1) or
SO(1, 3) depending on the choice of convention. In later chapters, we will consider what happens to quantum mechanics in the relativistic case, and there
encounter the corresponding Cliﬀord algebras Cliﬀ(3, 1, R) or Cliﬀ(1, 3, R).
The generators γj of such a Cliﬀord algebra are well known in the subject as
the “Dirac γ- matrices.”
For now though, we will restrict attention to the positive-deﬁnite case, so
just will be considering Cliﬀ(n, R) and seeing how it is used to study the
group O(n) of n-dimensional rotations in Rn .

29.2.1 Rotations as iterated orthogonal reﬂections
We will consider two diﬀerent ways of seeing the relationship between the
Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(n, R) and the group O(n) of rotations in Rn . The ﬁrst
is based upon the geometrical fact (known as the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem)
that one can get any rotation by doing at most n orthogonal reﬂections in
diﬀerent hyperplanes. Orthogonal reﬂection in the hyperplane perpendicular
to a vector w takes a vector v to the vector
v = v − 2

(v, w)
w
(w, w)

something that can easily be seen from the following picture

29 Cliﬀord Algebras and Geometry

From now on, we identify vectors v, v , w with the corresponding Cliﬀord
algebra elements by the map γ of equation 29.1. The linear transformation
given by reﬂection in w is

Identifying vectors with Cliﬀord algebra elements, the orthogonal transformation that is the result of one reﬂection is given by a conjugation (with
a minus sign). These reﬂections lie in the group O(n), but not in the subgroup SO(n), since they change orientation. The result of two reﬂections in
hyperplanes orthogonal to w1 , w2 will be a conjugation by w

This will be a rotation preserving the orientation, so of determinant one and
in the group SO(n).
This construction not only gives an eﬃcient way of representing rotations
(as conjugations in the Cliﬀord algebra), but it also provides a construction
of the group Spin(n) in arbitrary dimension n. One can deﬁne:
Definition (Spin(n)). The group Spin(n, R) is the group of invertible elements of the Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(n) of the form
w
/k
/2 ···w
/ 1w
where the vectors wj for j = 1, · · · , k (k ≤ n) are vectors in Rn satisfying
|wj |2 = 1 and k is even. Group multiplication is Cliﬀord algebra multiplication.

29.2

The action of Spin(n) on vectors v ∈ Rn will be given by conjugation
v
/ k) v
/ (w
/ 1w
/ k )−1
/2 ··· w
/2 ··· w
/ → (w
/ 1w

(29.3)

and this will correspond to a rotation of the vector v. This construction
generalizes to arbitrary n the one we gave in chapter 6 of Spin(3) in terms
of unit-length elements of the quaternion algebra H. One can see here the
characteristic fact that there are two elements of the Spin(n) group giving
the same rotation in SO(n) by noticing that changing the sign of the Cliﬀord
algebra element w
/ k does not change the conjugation action, where
/2 ···w
/ 1w
signs cancel.

29.2.2 The Lie algebra of the rotation group and
quadratic elements of the Cliﬀord algebra
For a second approach to understanding rotations in arbitrary dimension,
one can use the fact that these are generated by taking products of rotations
in the coordinate planes. A rotation by an angle θ in the jk coordinate plane
(j < k) will be given by
v → eθjk v
where jk is an n by n matrix with only two nonzero entries: jk entry −1
and kj entry +1 (see equation 5.2.1). Restricting attention to the jk plane,
eθjk acts as the standard rotation matrix in the plane

In the SO(3) case, we saw that there were three of these matrices
23 = l1 , 13 = −l2 , 12 = l3
providing a basis of the Lie algebra so(3). In n dimensions there will be
1
2
2 (n − n) of them, providing a basis of the Lie algebra so(n).
Just as in the case of SO(3) where unit-length quaternions were used, in
dimension n we can use elements of the Cliﬀord algebra to get these same
rotation transformations, but as conjugations in the Cliﬀord algebra. To see
how this works, consider the quadratic Cliﬀord algebra element γj γk for j = k
and notice that
(γj γk )2 = γj γk γj γk = −γj γj γk γk = −1

Note that these relations are closely analogous to what happens in the symplectic case, where the symplectic group Sp(2d, R) acts on linear combinations of the Qj , Pj by conjugation by the exponential of an operator quadratic
in the Qj , Pj . We will examine this analogy in greater detail in chapter 31.
One can also see that, just as in our earlier calculations in three dimensions,
one gets a double cover of the group of rotations, with here the elements
θ
e 2 γj γk of the Cliﬀord algebra giving a double cover of the group of rotations in
the jk plane (as θ goes from 0 to 2π). General elements of the spin group can
be constructed by multiplying these for diﬀerent angles in diﬀerent coordinate
planes. The Lie algebra spin(n) can be identiﬁed with the Lie algebra so(n)
by

jk ↔ − γj γk

Yet another way to see this would be to compute the commutators of the
− 12 γj γk for diﬀerent values of j, k and show that they satisfy the same commutation relations as the corresponding matrices jk .
Recall that in the bosonic case we found that quadratic combinations of
the Qj , Pk (or of the aB j , aB †j ) gave operators satisfying the commutation
relations of the Lie algebra sp(2n, R). This is the Lie algebra of the group
Sp(2n, R), the group preserving the non-degenerate antisymmetric bilinear
form Ω(·, ·) on the phase space R2n . The fermionic case is precisely analogous, with the role of the antisymmetric bilinear form Ω(·, ·) replaced by

the symmetric bilinear form (·, ·) and the Lie algebra sp(2n, R) replaced by
so(n) = spin(n).
In the bosonic case the linear functions of the Qj , Pj satisﬁed the commutation relations of another Lie algebra, the Heisenberg algebra, but in the
fermionic case this is not true for the γj . In chapter 30 we will see that a
notion of a “Lie superalgebra” can be deﬁned that restores the parallelism.

Some more detail about spin groups and the relationship between geometry
and Cliﬀord algebras can be found in [55], and an exhaustive reference is [68].

Chapter 30

Anticommuting Variables
and Pseudo-classical Mechanics

The analogy between the algebras of operators in the bosonic (Weyl algebra)
and fermionic (Cliﬀord algebra) cases can be extended by introducing a fermionic analog of phase space and the Poisson bracket. This gives a fermionic
analog of classical mechanics, sometimes called “pseudo-classical mechanics,”
the quantization of which gives the Cliﬀord algebra as operators, and spinors
as state spaces. In this chapter, we will introduce “anticommuting variables”
ξj that will be the fermionic analogs of the variables qj , pj . These objects will
become generators of the Cliﬀord algebra under quantization, and will later
be used in the construction of fermionic state spaces, by analogy with the
Schrödinger and Bargmann–Fock constructions in the bosonic case.

30.1 The Grassmann algebra
of polynomials on anticommuting
generators
Given a phase space M = R2d , one gets classical observables by taking
polynomial functions on M . These are generated by the linear functions
qj , pj , j = 1, . . . , d, which lie in the dual space M = M ∗ . One can instead
start with a real vector space V = Rn with n not necessarily even, and again
consider the space V ∗ of linear functions on V , but with a diﬀerent notion of
multiplication, one that is anticommutative on elements of V ∗ . Using such a
multiplication, an anticommuting analog of the algebra of polynomials on V
can be generated in the following manner, beginning with a choice of basis
elements ξj of V ∗ :
Definition (Grassmann algebra). The algebra over the real numbers generated by ξj , j = 1, . . . , n, satisfying the relations

ξj ξk + ξk ξj = 0
is called the Grassmann algebra.
Note that these relations imply that generators satisfy ξj2 = 0. Also, note
that sometimes the Grassmann algebra product of ξj and ξk is denoted ξj ∧
ξk . We will not use a diﬀerent symbol for the product in the Grassmann
algebra, relying on the notation for generators to keep straight what is a
generator of a conventional polynomial algebra (e.g., qj or pj ) and what is a
generator of a Grassmann algebra (e.g., ξj ).
The Grassmann algebra is the algebra Λ∗ (V ∗ ) of antisymmetric multilinear
forms on V discussed in section 9.6, except that we have chosen a basis of V
and have written out the deﬁnition in terms of the dual basis ξj of V ∗ . It is
sometimes also called the “exterior algebra.” This algebra behaves in many
ways like the polynomial algebra on Rn , but it is ﬁnite dimensional as a real
vector space, with basis
1, ξj , ξj ξk , ξj ξk ξl , · · · , ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn
for indices j < k < l < · · · taking values 1, 2, . . . , n. As with polynomials,
monomials are characterized by a degree (number of generators in the product), which in this case takes values from 0 only up to n. Λk (Rn ) is the
subspace of Λ∗ (Rn ) of linear combinations of monomials of degree k.
Digression (Diﬀerential forms). Readers may have already seen the Grassmann algebra in the context of diﬀerential forms on Rn . These are known
to physicists as “antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds,” and given by taking elements
of the exterior algebra Λ∗ (Rn ) with coeﬃcients not constants, but functions
on Rn . This construction is important in the theory of manifolds, where at
a point x in a manifold M , one has a tangent space Tx M and its dual space
(Tx M )∗ . A set of local coordinates xj on M gives basis elements of (Tx M )∗
denoted by dxj , and diﬀerential forms locally can be written as sums of terms
of the form
f (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn )dxj ∧ · · · ∧ dxk ∧ · · · ∧ dxl
where the indices j, k, l satisfy 1 ≤ j < k < l ≤ n.
A fundamental principle of mathematics is that a good way to understand
a space is in terms of the functions on it. What we have done here can be
thought of as creating a new kind of space out of Rn , where the algebra of
functions on the space is Λ∗ (Rn ), generated by coordinate functions ξj with
respect to a basis of Rn . The enlargement of conventional geometry to include
new kinds of spaces such that this makes sense is known as “supergeometry,”
but we will not attempt to pursue this subject here. Spaces with this new

kind of geometry have functions on them but do not have conventional points
since we have seen that one cannot ask what the value of an anticommuting
function at a point is.
Remarkably, an analog of calculus can be deﬁned on such unconventional
spaces, introducing analogs of the derivative and integral for anticommuting
functions (i.e., elements of the Grassmann algebra). For the case n = 1, an
arbitrary function is
F (ξ) = c0 + c1 ξ
and one can take

∂
F = c1
∂ξ

For larger values of n, an arbitrary function can be written as follows:
F (ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξn ) = FA + ξj FB
where FA , FB are functions that do not depend on the chosen ξj (one gets FB
by using the anticommutation relations to move ξj all the way to the left).
Then, one can deﬁne
∂
F = FB
∂ξj
This derivative operator has many of the same properties as the conventional
derivative, although there are unconventional signs one must keep track of.
An unusual property of this derivative that is easy to see is that one has
∂ ∂

where |F | is the degree of the monomial F .
A notion of integration (often called the “Berezin integral”) with many of
the usual properties of an integral can also be deﬁned. It has the peculiar
feature of being the same operation as diﬀerentiation, deﬁned in the n = 1
case by

30.2 Pseudo-classical mechanics
and the fermionic Poisson bracket
The basic structure of Hamiltonian classical mechanics depends on an evendimensional phase space M = R2d with a Poisson bracket {·, ·} on functions
on this space. Time evolution of a function f on phase space is determined by
d
f = {f, h}
dt
for some Hamiltonian function h. This says that taking the derivative of any
function in the direction of the velocity vector of a classical trajectory is the
linear map
f → {f, h}
on functions. As we saw in chapter 14, since this linear map is a derivative,
the Poisson bracket will have the derivation property, satisfying the Leibniz
rule
{f1 , f2 f3 } = f2 {f1 , f3 } + {f1 , f2 }f3
for arbitrary functions f1 , f2 , f3 on phase space. Using the Leibniz rule and
antisymmetry, Poisson brackets can be calculated for any polynomials, just
from knowing the Poisson bracket on generators qj , pj (or, equivalently, the
antisymmetric bilinear form Ω(·, ·)), which we chose to be

30.2

Pseudo-classical mechanics and the fermionic Poisson bracket

387

{qj , qk } = {pj , pk } = 0, {qj , pk } = −{pk , qj } = δjk
Notice that we have a symmetric multiplication on generators, while the
Poisson bracket is antisymmetric.
To get pseudo-classical mechanics, we think of the Grassmann algebra
Λ∗ (Rn ) as our algebra of classical observables, an algebra we can think of as
functions on a “fermionic” phase space V = Rn (note that in the fermionic
case, the phase space does not need to be even-dimensional). We want to ﬁnd
an appropriate notion of fermionic Poisson bracket operation on this algebra,
and it turns out that this can be done. While the standard Poisson bracket
is an antisymmetric bilinear form Ω(·, ·) on linear functions, the fermionic
Poisson bracket will be based on a choice of symmetric bilinear form on
linear functions, equivalently, a notion of inner product (·, ·).
Denoting the fermionic Poisson bracket by {·, ·}+ , for a multiplication
anticommutative on generators, one has to adjust signs in the Leibniz rule,
and the derivation property analogous to the derivation property of the usual
Poisson bracket is, for monomials F1 , F2 , F3 ,
{F1 F2 , F3 }+ = F1 {F2 , F3 }+ + (−1)|F2 ||F3 | {F1 , F3 }+ F2
where |F2 | and |F3 | are the degrees of F2 and F3 . It will also have the symmetry property
{F1 , F2 }+ = −(−1)|F1 ||F2 | {F2 , F1 }+
and these properties can be used to compute the fermionic Poisson bracket
for arbitrary functions in terms of the relations for generators.
The ξj can be thought of as the “anticommuting coordinate functions”
with respect to a basis ej of V = Rn . We have seen that the symmetric
bilinear forms on Rn are classiﬁed by a choice of positive signs for some basis
vectors, negative signs for the others. So, on generators ξj , one can choose
{ξj , ξk }+ = ±δjk
with a plus sign for j = k = 1, · · · , r and a minus sign for j = k = r +
1, · · · , n, corresponding to the possible inequivalent choices of non-degenerate
symmetric bilinear forms.
Taking the case of a positive-deﬁnite inner product for simplicity, one can
calculate explicitly the fermionic Poisson brackets for linear and quadratic
combinations of the generators. One ﬁnds
{ξj ξk , ξl }+ = ξj {ξk , ξl }+ − {ξj , ξl }+ ξk = δkl ξj − δjl ξk

(30.1)

388

30 Anticommuting Variables and Pseudo-classical Mechanics

and
{ξj ξk , ξl ξm }+ ={ξj ξk , ξl }+ ξm + ξl {ξj ξk , ξm }+
= δkl ξj ξm − δjl ξk ξm + δkm ξl ξj − δjm ξl ξk

(30.2)

The second of these equations shows that the quadratic combinations of the
generators ξj satisfy the relations of the Lie algebra of the group of rotations
in n dimensions (so(n) = spin(n)). The ﬁrst shows that the ξk ξl acts on the
ξj as inﬁnitesimal rotations in the kl plane.
In the case of the conventional Poisson bracket, the antisymmetry of the
bracket and the fact that it satisﬁes the Jacobi identity implies that it is a
Lie bracket determining a Lie algebra (the inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra
of functions on a phase space R2d ). The fermionic Poisson bracket provides
an example of something called a Lie superalgebra. These can be deﬁned for
vector spaces with some usual and some fermionic coordinates:
Definition (Lie superalgebra). A Lie superalgebra structure on a real or
complex vector space V is given by a Lie superbracket [·, ·]± . This is a bilinear
map on V which on generators X, Y, Z (which may be usual or fermionic
ones) satisﬁes
[X, Y ]± = −(−1)|X||Y | [Y, X]±
and a super-Jacobi identity
[X, [Y, Z]± ]± = [[X, Y ]± , Z]± + (−1)|X||Y | [Y, [X, Z]± ]±
where |X| takes value 0 for a usual generator, 1 for a fermionic generator.
Analogously to the bosonic case, on polynomials in generators with order of
the polynomial less than or equal to two, the fermionic Poisson bracket {·, ·}+
is a Lie superbracket, giving a Lie superalgebra of dimension 1 + n + 12 (n2 −
n) (since there is one constant, n linear terms ξj and 12 (n2 − n) quadratic
terms ξj ξk ). On functions of order two, this Lie superalgebra is a Lie algebra,
so(n). We will see in chapter 31 that the deﬁnition of a representation can be
generalized to Lie superalgebras, and quantization will give a distinguished
representation of this Lie superalgebra, in a manner quite parallel to that of
the Schrödinger or Bargmann–Fock constructions of a representation in the
bosonic case.
The relation between the quadratic and linear polynomials in the generators is parallel to what happens in the bosonic case. Here, we have the
fermionic analog of the bosonic theorem 16.2:
Theorem 30.1. The Lie algebra so(n, R) is isomorphic to the Lie algebra
Λ2 (V ∗ ) (with Lie bracket {·, ·}+ ) of order two anticommuting polynomials on
V = Rn , by the isomorphism

Proof. The theorem follows from equations 30.1 and 30.2, or one can proceed

30.3 Examples of pseudo-classical

In pseudo-classical mechanics, the dynamics will be determined by choosing
a Hamiltonian h in Λ∗ (Rn ). Observables will be other functions F ∈ Λ∗ (Rn ),
and they will satisfy the analog of Hamilton’s equations
d
F = {F, h}+
dt
We will consider two of the simplest possible examples.

30.3.1 The pseudo-classical spin degree of freedom
Using pseudo-classical mechanics, a “classical” analog can be found for something that is quintessentially quantum: the degree of freedom that appears in
the qubit or spin 12 system that ﬁrst appeared in chapter 3. Taking V = R3
with the standard inner product as fermionic phase space, we have three
generators ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 ∈ V ∗ satisfying the relations
{ξj , ξk }+ = δjk
and an eight-dimensional space of functions with basis
1, ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 , ξ1 ξ2 , ξ1 ξ3 , ξ2 ξ3 , ξ1 ξ2 ξ3
If we want the Hamiltonian function to be non-trivial and of even degree,
it will have to be a linear combination
h = B12 ξ1 ξ2 + B13 ξ1 ξ3 + B23 ξ2 ξ3
for some constants B12 , B13 , B23 . This can be written

which, since L = −LT , by theorem 30.1 can be written
d
ξj (t) = Lξj (t)

with solution
ξj (t) = etL ξj (0)
This will be a time-dependent rotation of the ξj in the plane perpendicular
to
B = (B23 , −B13 , B12 )
at a constant speed proportional to |B|.

30.3.2 The pseudo-classical fermionic oscillator
We have already studied the fermionic oscillator as a quantum system (in
section 27.2), and one can ask whether there is a corresponding pseudoclassical system. For the case of d oscillators, such a system is given by
taking an even-dimensional fermionic phase space V = R2d , with a basis
of coordinate functions ξ1 , · · · , ξ2d that generate Λ∗ (R2d ). On generators,
the fermionic Poisson bracket relations come from the standard choice of
positive-deﬁnite symmetric bilinear form
{ξj , ξk }+ = δjk
As shown in theorem 30.1, quadratic products ξj ξk act on the generators by
inﬁnitesimal rotations in the jk plane and satisfy the commutation relations
of so(2d).
To get a pseudo-classical system corresponding to the fermionic oscillator,
one makes the choice

As in the bosonic case, we can make the standard choice of complex structure J = J0 on R2d and get a decomposition

θj = √ (ξ2j−1 − iξ2j ), θj = √ (ξ2j−1 + iξ2j )

for j = 1, . . . , d. These satisfy the fermionic Poisson bracket relations
{θj , θk }+ = {θj , θk }+ = 0, {θj , θk }+ = δjk
(where we have extended the inner product {·, ·}+ to V ∗ ⊗ C by complex
linearity).

Chapter 31

Fermionic Quantization and Spinors

In this chapter, we will begin by investigating the fermionic analog of the
notion of quantization, which takes functions of anticommuting variables on
a phase space with symmetric bilinear form (·, ·) and gives an algebra of
operators with generators satisfying the relations of the corresponding Clifford algebra. We will then consider analogs of the constructions used in the
bosonic case which there gave us the Schrödinger and Bargmann–Fock representations of the Weyl algebra on a space of states.
We know that for a fermionic oscillator with d degrees of freedom, the
algebra of operators will be Cliﬀ(2d, C), the algebra generated by annihilation and creation operators aF j , aF †j . These operators will act on HF = Fd+ ,
a complex vector space of dimension 2d , and this will provide a fermionic
analog of the bosonic ΓBF acting on Fd . Since the spin group consists of
invertible elements of the Cliﬀord algebra, it has a representation on Fd+ .
This is known as the “spinor representation,” and it can be constructed by
analogy with the construction of the metaplectic representation in the bosonic
case. We will also consider the analog in the fermionic case of the Schrödinger
representation, which turns out to have a problem with unitarity, but ﬁnds
a use in physics as “ghost” degrees of freedom.

31.1 Quantization of pseudo-classical
systems
In the bosonic case, quantization was based on ﬁnding a representation of the
Heisenberg Lie algebra of linear functions on phase space, or more explicitly,

the Heisenberg commutation relations. In the fermionic case, the analog of

31 Fermionic Quantization and Spinors

the Heisenberg Lie algebra is not a Lie algebra, but a Lie superalgebra, with
basis elements 1, ξj , j = 1, . . . , n and a Lie superbracket given by the fermionic
Poisson bracket, which on basis elements is
{ξj , ξk }+ = ±δjk , {ξj , 1}+ = 0, {1, 1}+ = 0
Quantization is given by ﬁnding a representation of this Lie superalgebra.
The deﬁnition of a Lie algebra representation can be generalized to that of a
Lie superalgebra representation by:
Definition (Representation of a Lie superalgebra). A representation of a
Lie superalgebra is a homomorphism Φ preserving the superbracket
[Φ(X), Φ(Y )]± = Φ([X, Y ]± )
This takes values in a Lie superalgebra of linear operators, with |Φ(X)| = |X|
and
[Φ(X), Φ(Y )]± = Φ(X)Φ(Y ) − (−)|X||Y | Φ(Y )Φ(X)
A representation of the pseudo-classical Lie superalgebra (and thus a quantization of the pseudo-classical system) will be given by ﬁnding a linear map
Γ+ that takes basis elements ξj to operators Γ+ (ξj ) satisfying the relations
[Γ+ (ξj ), Γ+ (ξk )]+ = ±δjk Γ+ (1), [Γ+ (ξj ), Γ+ (1)] = [Γ+ (1), Γ+ (1)] = 0
These relations can be satisﬁed by taking
1
Γ+ (ξj ) = √ γj , Γ+ (1) = 1
2
since then
[Γ+ (ξj ), Γ+ (ξk )]+ =

[γj , γk ]+ = ±δjk

are exactly the Cliﬀord algebra relations. This can be extended to a representation of the functions of the ξj of order two or less by
Theorem. A representation of the Lie superalgebra of anticommuting functions of coordinates ξj on Rn of order two or less is given by

Γ+ (1) = 1, Γ+ (ξj ) = √ γj , Γ+ (ξj ξk ) = γj γk

Proof. We have already seen that this is a representation for polynomials

One could instead use the commutation relations for the so(n) Lie algebra satisﬁed by the basis elements jk corresponding to inﬁnitesimal rotations. One must get identical commutation relations for the − 12 γj γk and can
show that these are the relations needed for commutators of Γ+ (ξj ξk ) and

Γ+ (ξl ξm ).
Note that here we are not introducing the factors of i into the deﬁnition
of quantization that in the bosonic case were necessary to get a unitary representation of the Lie group corresponding to the real Heisenberg Lie algebra
h2d+1 . In the bosonic, case we worked with all complex linear combinations of
powers of the Qj , Pj (the complex Weyl algebra Weyl(2d, C)), and thus had
to identify the speciﬁc complex linear combinations of these that gave unitary
representations of the Lie algebra h2d+1  sp(2d, R). Here we are not complexifying for now, but working with the real Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(r, s, R),
and it is the irreducible representations of this algebra that provide an analog
of the unique interesting irreducible representation of h2d+1 . In the Cliﬀord
algebra case, the representations of interest are not just Lie algebra representations and may be on real vector spaces. There is no analog of the unitarity
property of the h2d+1 representation.
In the bosonic case, we found that Sp(2d, R) acted on the bosonic dual
phase space, preserving the antisymmetric bilinear form Ω that determined
the Lie algebra h2d+1 , so it acted on this Lie algebra by automorphisms. We
saw (see chapter 20) that intertwining operators there gave us a representation of the double cover of Sp(2d, R) (the metaplectic representation), with
the Lie algebra representation given by the quantization of quadratic functions of the qj , pj phase space coordinates. There is a closely analogous story
in the fermionic case, where SO(r, s, R) acts on the fermionic phase space
V , preserving the symmetric bilinear form (·, ·) that determines the Cliﬀord

algebra relations. Here, a representation of the spin group Spin(r, s, R) double covering SO(r, s, R) is constructed using intertwining operators, with the
Lie algebra representation given by quadratic combinations of the quantizations of the fermionic coordinates ξj . The case of r = 3, s = 1 will be of
importance later in our discussion of special relativity (see chapter 41), giving the spinor representation of the Lorentz group.
The fermionic analog of 20.1 is
Uk Γ+ (ξ)Uk−1 = Γ+ (φk0 (ξ))

(31.1)

Here k0 ∈ SO(r, s, R), ξ ∈ V ∗ = Rn (n = r + s), φk0 is the action of k0 on
V ∗ . The Uk for k = Φ−1 (k0 ) ∈ Spin(r, s) (Φ is the 2-fold covering map) are
the intertwining operators we are looking for. The fermionic analog of 20.2 is
[UL , Γ+ (ξ)] = Γ+ (L · ξ)
where L ∈ so(r, s, R) and L act on V ∗ as an inﬁnitesimal orthogonal transformation. In terms of basis vectors of V ∗

this says

[UL , Γ+ (ξ)] = Γ+ (LT ξ)

Just as in the bosonic case, the UL can be found by looking ﬁrst at the
pseudo-classical case, where one has theorem 30.1 which says
{μL , ξ}+ = LT ξ
where
μL =

the group version. Just as in the symplectic case, exponentiating the UL only
gives a representation up to sign, and one needs to go to the double cover
of SO(n) to get a true representation. As in that case, the necessity of the
double cover is best seen by use of a complex structure and an analog of the
Bargmann–Fock construction, an example will be given in section 31.4.
In order to have a full construction of a quantization of a pseudo-classical
system, we need to construct the Γ+ (ξj ) as linear operators on a state space.
As mentioned in section 28.2, it can be shown that the real Cliﬀord algebras Cliﬀ(r, s, R) are isomorphic to either one or two copies of the matrix
algebras M (2l , R), M (2l , C), or M (2l , H), with the power l depending on
r, s. The irreducible representations of such a matrix algebra are just the
column vectors of dimension 2l , and there will be either one or two such irreducible representations for Cliﬀ(r, s, R) depending on the number of copies of
the matrix algebra. This is the fermionic analog of the Stone–von Neumann
uniqueness result in the bosonic case.

31.1.1 Quantization of the pseudo-classical spin
As an example, one can consider the quantization of the pseudo-classical
spin degree of freedom of section 30.3.1. In that case, Γ+ takes values in
Cliﬀ(3, 0, R), for which an explicit identiﬁcation with the algebra M (2, C) of
two-by-two complex matrices was given in section 28.2. One has
1

Γ+ (ξj ) = √ γj = √ σj

and the Hamiltonian operator is
−iH = Γ+ (h) =Γ+ (B12 ξ1 ξ2 + B13 ξ1 ξ3 + B23 ξ2 ξ3 )

Here, the state space is H = C2 , with an explicit choice of basis given by
our chosen identiﬁcation of Cliﬀ(3, 0, R) with two-by-two complex matrices.
In the next sections, we will consider the case of an even-dimensional fermionic phase space, but there provide a basis-independent construction of the
state space and the action of the Cliﬀord algebra on it.

31.2 The Schrödinger representation
for fermions: ghosts
We would like to construct representations of Cliﬀ(r, s, R) and thus fermionic state spaces by using analogous constructions to the Schrödinger and
Bargmann–Fock ones in the bosonic case. The Schrödinger construction took
the state space H to be a space of functions on a subspace of the classical phase space which had the property that the basis coordinate functions Poisson-commuted. Two examples of this are the position coordinates
qj , since {qj , qk } = 0, or the momentum coordinates pj , since {pj , pk } = 0.
Unfortunately, for symmetric bilinear forms (·, ·) of deﬁnite sign, such as the
positive-deﬁnite case Cliﬀ(n, R), the only subspace the bilinear form is zero
on is the zero subspace.
To get an analog of the bosonic situation, one needs to take the case of
signature (d, d). The fermionic phase space will then be 2d dimensional, with
d-dimensional subspaces on which (·, ·) and thus the fermionic Poisson bracket
is zero. Quantization will give the Cliﬀord algebra
Cliﬀ(d, d, R) = M (2d , R)
which has just one irreducible representation, R2 . This can be complexiﬁed
to get a complex state space

HF = C2

31.2

The Schrödinger representation for fermions: ghosts

This state space will come with a representation of Spin(d, d, R) from exponentiating quadratic combinations of the generators of Cliﬀ(d, d, R). However,
this is a non-compact group, and one can show that on general grounds, it
cannot have faithful unitary ﬁnite dimensional representations, so there must
be a problem with unitarity.
To see what happens explicitly, consider the simplest case d = 1 of one
degree of freedom. In the bosonic case, the classical phase space is R2 , and
quantization gives operators Q, P which in the Schrödinger representation
∂
. In the fermionic case with
act on functions of q, with Q = q and P = −i ∂q
signature (1, 1), basis coordinate functions on phase space are ξ1 , ξ2 , with
{ξ1 , ξ1 }+ = 1, {ξ2 , ξ2 }+ = −1, {ξ1 , ξ2 }+ = 0
Deﬁning

η = √ (ξ1 + ξ2 ), π = √ (ξ1 − ξ2 )

one gets objects with fermionic Poisson bracket analogous to those of q and p
{η, η}+ = {π, π}+ = 0, {η, π}+ = 1
Quantizing, we get analogs of the Q, P operators

η = Γ+ (η) = √ (Γ+ (ξ1 ) + Γ+ (ξ2 )), π = Γ+ (π) = √ (Γ+ (ξ1 ) − Γ+ (ξ2 ))

which satisfy anticommutation relations
η 2 = π 2 = 0, η π + π η = 1
and can be realized as operators on the space of functions of one fermionic
variable η as
∂
η = multiplication by η, π =
∂η
This state space is two-complex dimensional, with an arbitrary state
f (η) = c1 1 + c2 η
with cj complex numbers. The inner product on this space is given by the
fermionic integral
(f1 (η), f2 (η)) =

f1∗ (η)f2 (η)dη

402

with

31 Fermionic Quantization and Spinors

f ∗ (ξ) = c1 1 + c2 η

With respect to this inner product, one has
(1, 1) = (η, η) = 0, (1, η) = (η, 1) = 1
This inner product is indeﬁnite and can take on negative values, since
(1 − η, 1 − η) = −2
Having such negative-norm states ruins any standard interpretation of this
as a physical system, since this negative number is supposed to the probability
of ﬁnding the system in this state. Such quantum systems are called “ghosts,”
and do have applications in the description of various quantum systems,
but only when a mechanism exists for the negative-norm states to cancel or
otherwise be removed from the physical state space of the theory.

31.3 Spinors and the Bargmann–Fock
construction
While the fermionic analog of the Schrödinger construction does not give
a unitary representation of the spin group, it turns out that the fermionic
analog of the Bargmann–Fock construction does, on the fermionic oscillator
state space discussed in chapter 27. This will work for the case of a positivedeﬁnite symmetric bilinear form (·, ·). Note though that this will only work
for fermionic phase spaces Rn with n even, since a complex structure on the
phase space is needed.
The corresponding pseudo-classical system will be the classical fermionic
oscillator studied in section 30.3.2. Recall that this uses a choice of complex
structure J on the fermionic phase space R2d , with the standard choice J =
J0 coming from the relations
1
1
θj = √ (ξ2j−1 − iξ2j ), θj = √ (ξ2j−1 + iξ2j )
2
2

(31.2)

for j = 1, . . . , d between real and complex coordinates. Here (·, ·) is positive
deﬁnite, and the ξj are coordinates with respect to an orthonormal basis, so
we have the standard relation {ξj , ξk }+ = δjk and the θj , θj satisfy
{θj , θk }+ = {θj , θk }+ = 0, {θj , θk }+ = δjk

31.3

Spinors and the Bargmann–Fock construction

403

In the bosonic case (see equation 26.7), extending the Poisson bracket
from M to M ⊗ C by complex linearity gave an indeﬁnite Hermitian form
on M ⊗ C
·, · = i{·, ·} = iΩ(·, ·)
positive deﬁnite on M+
J for positive J. In the fermionic case, we can extend
the fermionic Poisson bracket from V to V ⊗ C by complex linearity, getting
a Hermitian form on V ⊗ C
·, · = {·, ·}+ = (·, ·)
This is positive deﬁnite on VJ+ (and also on VJ− ) if the initial symmetric
bilinear form was positive.
To quantize this system, we need to ﬁnd operators Γ+ (θj ) and Γ+ (θj ) that
satisfy
[Γ+ (θj ), Γ+ (θk )]+ = [Γ+ (θj ), Γ+ (θk )]+ = 0
[Γ+ (θj ), Γ+ (θk )]+ = δjk 1
but these are just the CAR satisﬁed by fermionic annihilation and creation
operators. We can choose
Γ+ (θj ) = aF †j , Γ+ (θj ) = aF j
and realize these operators as
aF j =

∂
, aF †j = multiplication by θj
∂θj

on the state space Λ∗ Cd of polynomials in the anticommuting variables θj .
This is a complex vector space of dimension 2d , isomorphic with the state
space HF of the fermionic oscillator in d degrees of freedom, with the isomorphism given by
1 ↔ |0F
θj ↔ aF †j |0F
θj θk ↔ aF †j aF †k |0
···
θ1 . . . θd ↔ aF †1 aF †2 · · · aF †d |0F
where the indices j, k, . . . take values 1, 2, . . . , d and satisfy j < k < · · · .
If one deﬁnes a Hermitian inner product ·, · on HF by taking these basis
elements to be orthonormal, the operators aF j and a†F j will be adjoints with

404

31 Fermionic Quantization and Spinors

respect to this inner product. This same inner product can also be deﬁned
using fermionic integration by analogy with the Bargmann–Fock deﬁnition
in the bosonic case as
e−

f1 (θ1 , · · · , θd ), f2 (θ1 , · · · , θd ) =

d

j=1 θj θ j

f1 f2 dθdθ1 · · · dθd dθd

(31.3)
where f1 and f2 are complex linear combinations of the powers of the anticommuting variables θj . For the details of the construction of this inner product,
see chapter 7.2 of [90] or chapters 7.5 and 7.6 of [109]. We will denote this
state space as Fd+ and refer to it as the fermionic Fock space. Since it is ﬁnite
dimensional, there is no need for a completion as in the bosonic case.
The quantization using fermionic annihilation and creation operators given
here provides an explicit realization of a representation of the Cliﬀord algebra
Cliﬀ(2d, R) on the complex vector space Fd+ . The generators of the Cliﬀord
algebra are identiﬁed as operators on Fd+ by

(31.4)
where H is the Hamiltonian operator for the fermionic oscillator used in
chapter 27.
Taking quadratic combinations of the operators γj provides a representation of the Lie algebra so(2d) = spin(2d). This representation exponentiates
to a representation up to sign of the group SO(2d), and a true representation
of its double cover Spin(2d). The representation that we have constructed
here on the fermionic oscillator state space Fd+ is called the spinor representation of Spin(2d), and we will sometimes denote Fd+ with this group
action as S.
In the bosonic case, H = Fd is an irreducible representation of the Heisenberg group, but as a representation of M p(2d, R), it has two irreducible components, corresponding to even and odd polynomials. The fermionic analog
is that Fd+ is irreducible under the action of the Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(2d, C).
One way to show this is to show that Cliﬀ(2d, C) is isomorphic to the matrix

31.3

Spinors and the Bargmann–Fock construction

405

algebra M (2d , C) and its action on HF = C2 is isomorphic to the action of
matrices on column vectors.
While Fd+ is irreducible as a representation of the Cliﬀord algebra, it is
the sum of two irreducible representations of Spin(2d), the so-called “halfspinor” representations. Spin(2d) is generated by quadratic combinations of
the Cliﬀord algebra generators, so these will preserve the subspaces
d

S+ = span{|0F , aF †j aF †k |0F , · · · } ⊂ S = Fd+
and

S− = span{aF †j |0F , aF †j aF †k aF †l |0F , · · · } ⊂ S = Fd+

corresponding to the action of an even or odd number of creation operators
on |0F . This is because quadratic combinations of the aF j , aF †j preserve the
parity of the number of creation operators used to get an element of S by
action on |0F .

31.4 Complex structures, U (d) ⊂ SO(2d)
and the spinor representation
The construction of the spinor representation given here has used a speciﬁc
choice of the θj , θj (see equations 31.2) and the fermionic annihilation and creation operators. This corresponds to a standard choice of complex structure
J0 , which appears in a manner closely parallel to that of the Bargmann–Fock
case of section 26.1. The diﬀerence here is that, for the analogous construction of spinors, the complex structure J must be chosen so as to preserve not
an antisymmetric bilinear form Ω, but the inner product, and one has
(J(·), J(·)) = (·, ·)
We will here restrict to the case of (·, ·) positive deﬁnite, and unlike in the
bosonic case, no additional positivity condition on J will then be required.
J splits the complexiﬁcation of the real dual phase space V ∗ = V = R2d
with its coordinates ξj into a d-dimensional complex vector space on which
J = +i and a conjugate complex vector space on which J = −i. As in the
bosonic case, one has
V ⊗ C = VJ+ ⊕ VJ−
and quantization of vectors in VJ+ gives linear combinations of creation operators, while vectors in VJ− are taken to linear combinations of annihilation
operators. The choice of J is reﬂected in the existence of a distinguished direction |0F in the spinor space S = Fd+ which is determined (up to phase) by

406

31 Fermionic Quantization and Spinors

the condition that it is annihilated by all linear combinations of annihilation
operators.
The choice of J also picks out a subgroup U (d) ⊂ SO(2d) of those orthogonal transformations that commute with J. Just as in the bosonic case, two
diﬀerent representations of the Lie algebra u(d) of U (d) are used:
• The restriction to u(d) ⊂ so(2d) of the spinor representation is described
above. This exponentiates to give a representation not of U (d), but of a
double cover of U (d) that is a subgroup of Spin(2d).
• By normal-ordering operators, one shifts the spinor representation of
u(d) by a constant and gets a representation that exponentiates to a true
representation of U (d). This representation is reducible, with irreducible
components the Λk (Cd ) for k = 0, 1, . . . , d.
In both cases, the representation of u(d) is constructed using quadratic combinations of annihilation and creation operators involving one annihilation
operator and one creation operator, operators which annihilate |0F . Nonzero
pairs of two creation operators act non-trivially on |0F , corresponding to the
fact that elements of SO(2d) not in the U (d) subgroup take |0F to a diﬀerent
state in the spinor representation.
Given any group element
g0 = eA ⊂ U (d)
acting on the fermionic dual phase space preserving J and the inner product, we can use exactly the same method as in theorems 25.1 and 25.2 to
construct its action on the fermionic state space by the second of the above
representations. For A a skew-adjoint matrix, we have a fermionic moment
map
θj Ajk θk
A ∈ u(d) → μA =
j,k

satisfying
{μA , μA }+ = μ[A,A ]
and
{μA , θ}+ = AT θ, {μA , θ}+ = AT θ = −Aθ
The Lie algebra representation operators are the
a†F j Ajk aF k

UA =

which satisfy (see theorem 27.1)

[UA , UA  ] = U[A,A ]
and

annihilation and creation operators as

31.5 An example: spinors for SO(4)
We saw in chapter 6 that the spin group Spin(4) was isomorphic to Sp(1) ×
Sp(1) = SU (2) × SU (2). Its action on R4 was then given by identifying R4 =
H and acting by unit quaternions on the left and the right (thus the two copies
of Sp(1)). While this constructs the representation of Spin(4) on R4 , it does
not provide the spin representation of Spin(4).
A conventional way of deﬁning the spin representation is to choose an
explicit matrix representation of the Cliﬀord algebra (in this case Cliﬀ
(4, 0, R)), for instance
γ0 =

where we have written the matrices in 2 by 2 block form and are indexing
the four dimensions from 0 to 3. One can easily check that these satisfy the
Cliﬀord algebra relations: They anticommute with each other and

The Lie algebra spin representation is just matrix multiplication on S =
C4 , and it is obviously a reducible representation on two copies of C2 (the
upper and lower two components). One can also see that the Lie algebra
spin(4) = su(2) ⊕ su(2), with the two su(2) Lie algebras having bases

The irreducible spin representations of Spin(4) are just the tensor product
of spin 12 representations of the two copies of SU (2) (with each copy acting
on a diﬀerent factor of the tensor product).
In the fermionic oscillator construction, we have
S = S + + S − , S + = span{1, θ1 θ2 }, S − = span{θ1 , θ2 }
and the Cliﬀord algebra action on S is given for the generators as (now

Note that in this construction, there is a choice of complex structure J =

31 Fermionic Quantization and Spinors

The construction in terms of matrices is well suited to calculations, but
it is inherently dependent on a choice of coordinates. The fermionic version
of Bargmann–Fock is given here in terms of a choice of basis, but, like the
closely analogous bosonic construction, only actually depends on a choice of
inner product and a choice of compatible complex structure J, producing a
representation on the coordinate-independent object Fd+ = Λ∗ VJ+ .
In chapter 41, we will consider explicit matrix representations of the Clifford algebra for the case of Spin(3, 1). The fermionic oscillator construction
could also be used, complexifying to get a representation of
so(4) ⊗ C = sl(2, C) ⊕ sl(2, C)
and then restricting to the subalgebra
so(3, 1) ⊂ so(3, 1) ⊗ C = so(4) ⊗ C
This will give a representation of Spin(3, 1) in terms of quadratic combinations of Cliﬀord algebra generators, but unlike the case of Spin(4), it will not
be unitary. The lack of positivity for the inner product causes the same sort
of wrong-sign problems with the CAR that were found in the bosonic case for
the CCR when J and Ω gave a non-positive symmetric bilinear form. In the
fermion case, the wrong-sign problem does not stop one from constructing a
representation, but it will not be a unitary representation.

For more about pseudo-classical mechanics and quantization, see [90] chapter
7. The Cliﬀord algebra and fermionic quantization are discussed in chapter
20.3 of [46]. The fermionic quantization map, Cliﬀord algebras, and the spinor
representation are discussed in detail in [59]. For another discussion of the
spinor representation from a similar point of view to the one here, see chapter
12 of [94]. Chapter 12 of [70] contains an extensive discussion of the role of
diﬀerent complex structures in the construction of the spinor representation.

Supersymmetry, Some Simple
Examples

If one considers fermionic and bosonic quantum systems that each separately
has operators coming from Lie algebra or superalgebra representations on
their state spaces, when one combines the systems by taking the tensor product, these operators will continue to act on the combined system. In certain
special cases, new operators with remarkable properties will appear that mix
the fermionic and bosonic systems and commute with the Hamiltonian (these
operators are often given by some sort of “square root” of the Hamiltonian).
These are generically known as “supersymmetries” and provide new information about energy eigenspaces. In this chapter, we will examine in detail
some of the simplest such quantum systems, examples of “supersymmetric
quantum mechanics.”

33.1 The supersymmetric oscillator
In the previous chapters, we discussed in detail
• The bosonic harmonic oscillator in d degrees of freedom, with state space

of times to a lowest energy state |0B . The Hamiltonian is

Notice that the lowest energy state |0 for the combined system has energy 0,
due to cancellation between the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.
For now, taking for simplicity the case d = 1 of one degree of freedom, the
Hamiltonian is
H = (NB + NF )ω
with eigenvectors |nB , nF  satisfying
H|nB , nF  = (nB + nF )ω
While there is a unique lowest energy state |0, 0 of zero energy, all nonzero
energy states come in pairs, with two states
|n, 0 and |n − 1, 1
both having energy nω.
This kind of degeneracy of energy eigenvalues usually indicates the existence of some new symmetry operators commuting with the Hamiltonian
operator. We are looking for operators that will take |n, 0 to |n − 1, 1 and
vice versa, and the obvious choice is the two operators
Q+ = aB a†F , Q− = a†B aF
which are not self-adjoint, but are each other’s adjoints ((Q− )† = Q+ ).
The pattern of energy eigenstates looks like this

Figure 33.1: Energy eigenstates in the supersymmetric oscillator.

Computing anticommutators using the CCR and CAR for the bosonic and
fermionic operators (and the fact that the bosonic operators commute with
the fermionic ones since they act on diﬀerent factors of the tensor product),
one ﬁnds that
Q2+ = Q2− = 0
and

(Q+ + Q− )2 = [Q+ , Q− ]+ = H

One could instead work with self-adjoint combinations
Q1 = Q+ + Q− , Q2 =
which satisfy

1
(Q+ − Q− )
i

[Q1 , Q2 ]+ = 0, Q21 = Q22 = H

(33.1)

The Hamiltonian H is a square of the self-adjoint operator Q+ + Q− , and
this fact alone tells us that the energy eigenvalues will be nonnegative. It also
tells us that energy eigenstates of nonzero energy will come in pairs

416

33 Supersymmetry, Some Simple Examples

|ψ, (Q+ + Q− )|ψ
with the same energy. To ﬁnd states of zero energy (there will just be one,
|0, 0), instead of trying to solve the equation H|0 = 0 for |0, one can look
for solutions to
Q1 |0 = 0 or Q2 |0 = 0
The simpliﬁcation here is much like what happens with the usual bosonic
harmonic oscillator, where the lowest energy state in various representations
can be found by looking for solutions to a|0 = 0.
There is an example of a physical quantum mechanical system that has
exactly the behavior of this supersymmetric oscillator. A charged particle
conﬁned to a plane, coupled to a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane,
can be described by a Hamiltonian that can be put in the bosonic oscillator
form (to show this, we need to know how to couple quantum systems to
electromagnetic ﬁelds, which we will come to in chapter 45). The equally
spaced energy levels are known as “Landau levels.” If the particle has spin,
there will be an additional term in the Hamiltonian coupling the spin and
the magnetic ﬁeld, exactly the one we have seen in our study of the twostate system. This additional term is precisely the Hamiltonian of a fermionic
oscillator. For the case of gyromagnetic ratio g = 2, the coeﬃcients match up
so that we have exactly the supersymmetric oscillator described above, with
exactly the pattern of energy levels seen there.

33.2 Supersymmetric quantum mechanics
with a superpotential
The supersymmetric oscillator system can be generalized to a much wider
class of potentials, while still preserving the supersymmetry of the system.
For simplicity, we will here choose constants  = ω = 1. Recall that our
bosonic annihilation and creation operators were deﬁned by
1
1
aB = √ (Q + iP ), a†B = √ (Q − iP )
2
2
Introducing an arbitrary function W (q) (called the “superpotential”) with
derivative W  (q), we can deﬁne new annihilation and creation operators:
1
1
aB = √ (W  (Q) + iP ), a†B = √ (W  (Q) − iP )
2
2

Here, W  (Q) is the multiplication operator W  (q) in the Schrödinger position
space representation on functions of q. The harmonic oscillator is the special
case
q2
W (q) =
2
We keep our deﬁnition of the operators
Q+ = aB a†F , Q− = a†B aF
These satisfy

Q2+ = Q2− = 0

for the same reason as in the oscillator case: Repeated factors of aF or a†F
vanish. Taking as the Hamiltonian the same square as before, we ﬁnd
H =(Q+ + Q− )2
1
1
= (W  (Q) + iP )(W  (Q) − iP )a†F aF + (W  (Q) − iP )(W  (Q) + iP )aF a†F

But iP is the operator corresponding to inﬁnitesimal translations in Q, so we
have
i[P, W  (Q)] = W  (Q)
and
H=

1
1
(W  (Q)2 + P 2 ) + W  (Q)σ3

For diﬀerent choices of W , this gives a large class of quantum systems that
can be used as toy models to investigate properties of ground states. All have
the same state space
H = HB ⊗ Fd+ = L2 (R) ⊗ C2
(using the Schrödinger representation for the bosonic factor). The energy
eigenvalues will be nonnegative, and energy eigenvectors with positive energy
will occur in pairs
|ψ, (Q+ + Q− )|ψ
For any quantum system, an important question is that of whether it has
a unique lowest energy state. If the lowest energy state is not unique, and

418

33 Supersymmetry, Some Simple Examples

a symmetry group acts non-trivially on the space of lowest energy states,
the symmetry is said to be “spontaneously broken,” a situation that will be
discussed in section 39.4. In supersymmetric quantum mechanics systems,
thinking in terms of Lie superalgebras, one calls Q1 the generator of the
action of a supersymmetry, with H invariant under the supersymmetry in
the sense that the commutator of Q1 and H is zero. The question of how the
supersymmetry acts on the lowest energy state depends on whether or not
solutions can be found to the equation
(Q+ + Q− )|0 = Q1 |0 = 0
which will be a lowest energy state with zero energy. If such a solution does
exist, one describes the ground state |0 as “invariant under the supersymmetry.” If no such solution exists, Q1 will take a lowest energy state to another,
diﬀerent, lowest energy state, in which case one says that one has “spontaneously broken supersymmetry.” The question of whether a given supersymmetric theory has its supersymmetry spontaneously broken or not is one that
has become of great interest in the case of much more sophisticated supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theories. There, hopes (so far unrealized) of making
contact with the real world rely on ﬁnding theories where the supersymmetry
is spontaneously broken.
In this simple quantum mechanical system, one can try and explicitly solve
the equation Q1 |ψ = 0. States can be written as two-component complex

or

If, for example, W (q) is an odd polynomial, one will not be able to satisfy
either of these conditions, so there will be no solution, and the supersymmetry
will be spontaneously broken.

33.3 Supersymmetric quantum mechanics
and diﬀerential forms
If one considers supersymmetric quantum mechanics in the case of d degrees
of freedom and in the Schrödinger representation, one has
H = L2 (Rd ) ⊗ Λ∗ (Cd )
the tensor product of complex-valued functions on Rd (acted on by the Weyl
algebra Weyl(2d, C)) and anticommuting functions on Cd (acted on by the
Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(2d, C)). There are two operators Q+ and Q− , adjoints
of each other and of square zero. If one has studied diﬀerential forms, this
should look familiar. This space H is well known to mathematicians, as the
complex-valued diﬀerential forms on Rd , often written Ω∗ (Rd ), where here
the ∗ denotes an index taking values from 0 (the 0-forms, or functions) to d
(the d-forms). In the theory of diﬀerential forms, it is well known that one has
an operator d on Ω∗ (Rd ) with square zero, called the de Rham diﬀerential.
Using the inner product on Rd , a Hermitian inner product can be put on
Ω∗ (Rd ) by integration, and then d has an adjoint δ, also of square zero. The
Laplacian operator on diﬀerential forms is
 = (d + δ)2
The supersymmetric quantum system we have been considering corresponds precisely to this, once one conjugates d, δ as follows
Q+ = e−W (q) deW (q) , Q− = eW (q) δe−W (q)
In mathematics, the interest in diﬀerential forms mainly comes from the
fact that they can be constructed not just on Rd , but on a general diﬀeren-

420

33 Supersymmetry, Some Simple Examples

tiable manifold M , with a corresponding construction of d, δ,  operators. In
Hodge theory, one studies solutions of
ψ = 0
(these are called “harmonic forms”) and ﬁnds that the dimension of the
space of solutions ψ ∈ Ωk (M ) gives a topological invariant called the kth
Betti number of the manifold M .

33.4 For further reading
For a reference at the level of these notes, see [31]. For more details about
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, see the quantum mechanics textbook
of Tahktajan [90], and lectures by Orlando Alvarez [1]. These references also
describe the relation of these systems to the calculation of topological invariants, a topic pioneered in Witten’s 1982 paper on supersymmetry and Morse
theory [102].

Chapter 34

The Pauli Equation and the Dirac
Operator

In Chapter 33, we considered supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems
where both the bosonic and fermionic variables that get quantized take values in an even-dimensional space R2d = Cd . There are then two diﬀerent
operators Q1 and Q2 that are square roots of the Hamiltonian operator. It
turns out that there are much more interesting quantum mechanics systems
that can be deﬁned by quantizing bosonic variables in phase space R2d , and
fermionic variables in Rd . The operators appearing in such a theory will be
given by the tensor product of the Weyl algebra in 2d variables and the Clifford algebra in d variables, and there will be a distinguished operator that
provides a square root of the Hamiltonian.
This is equivalent to the fact that introduction of fermionic variables and
the Cliﬀord algebra provides the Casimir operator −|P|2 for the Euclidean
/ This leads to a new way
group E(3) with a square root: the Dirac operator ∂.
to construct irreducible representations of the group of spatial symmetries,
using a new sort of quantum free particle, one carrying an internal “spin”
degree of freedom due to the use of the Cliﬀord algebra. Remarkably, fundamental matter particles are well described in exactly this way, both in the
non-relativistic theory we study in this chapter and in the relativistic theory
to be studied later.

on the state space HF = C2 . For this system, we considered the Hamiltonian describing its interaction with a constant background magnetic
ﬁeld
1
(34.1)
H = − (B1 σ1 + B2 σ2 + B3 σ3 )
2
It turns out to be an experimental fact that fundamental matter particles
are described by a quantum system that is the tensor product of these two
systems, with state space
H = HB ⊗ HF = L2 (R3 ) ⊗ C2

(34.2)

which can be thought of as two-component complex wavefunctions. This system has a pseudo-classical description using a phase space with six conventional coordinates qj , pj and three fermionic coordinates ξj . On functions of
these coordinates, one has a generalized Poisson bracket {·, ·}± which provides
a Lie superalgebra structure on such functions. On generators, the nonzero
bracket relations are
{qj , pk }± = δjk , {ξj , ξk }± = δjk
For now, we will take the background magnetic ﬁeld B = 0. In chapter 45,
we will see how to generalize the free particle to the case of a particle in
a general background electromagnetic ﬁeld, and then the Hamiltonian term
34.1 involving the B ﬁeld will appear. In the absence of electromagnetic ﬁelds,
the classical Hamiltonian function will still be

Note the appearance of the function p1 ξ1 + p2 ξ2 + p3 ξ3 which now plays
a role even more fundamental than that of the Hamiltonian (which can be
expressed in terms of it). In this pseudo-classical theory, p1 ξ1 + p2 ξ2 + p3 ξ3
is the function generating a “supersymmetry,” Poisson commuting with the
Hamiltonian, while at the same time playing the role of a sort of “square
root” of the Hamiltonian. It provides a new sort of symmetry that can be
thought of as a “square root” of an inﬁnitesimal time translation.
Quantization takes

are each two-component complex functions on the sphere 2mE = |p| (or

will be to show
Theorem. The spaces of solutions ψE,± (p) to equations 34.6 provide irre the double cover of E(3), with eigenvalue
ducible representations of E(3),
2mE for the first Casimir operator
|P|2 = (σ · P)2
√
and eigenvalues ± 12 2mE for the second Casimir operator J · P.
We will not try to prove irreducibility, but just show that these solution
spaces give representations with the claimed eigenvalues of the Casimir operators (see sections 19.2 and 19.3 for more about the Casimir operators and
general theory of representations of E(3)). We will write the representation
operators as u(a, Ω) in position space and u
(a, Ω) in momentum space, with
a a translation, Ω ∈ SU (2) and R = Φ(Ω) ∈ SO(3).
The translation part of the group acts as in the one-component case of
chapter 19, by the multiplication operator
u
(a, 1)ψE,± (p) = e−ia·p ψE,± (p)
and

u
(a, 1) = e−ia·P

so the Lie algebra representation is given by the usual P operator. This action
of the translations is easily seen to commute with σ · P and thus act on the
solutions to 34.6. It is the action of rotations that requires a more complicated
discussion than in the single-component case.
In chapter 19, we saw that R ∈ SO(3) acts on single-component momentum space solutions of the Schrödinger equation by
(0, R)ψE (p) = ψE (R−1 p)
ψE (p) → u
This takes solutions to solutions since the operator u
(0, R) commutes with
the Casimir operator |P|2
u
(0, R)|P|2 = |P|2 u
(0, R) ⇐⇒ u

34 The Pauli Equation and the Dirac Operator

To get a representation on two-component wavefunctions that commutes
with the operator σ · P, we need to change the action of rotations to
(0, Ω)ψE,± (p) = ΩψE,± (R−1 p)
ψE,± (p) → u
With this action on solutions, we have
u(0, Ω)(σ · P)Ω−1 ψE,± (Rp)
u
(0, Ω)(σ · P)
u(0, Ω)−1 ψE,± (p) =
=Ω(σ · R−1 P)Ω−1 ψE,± (R−1 Rp)
=(σ · P)ψE,± (p)
where we have used equation 6.5 to show
Ω(σ · R−1 P)Ω−1 = σ · RR−1 P = σ · P
The SU (2) part of the group acts by a product of two commuting diﬀerent
actions on the two factors of the tensor product 34.2. These are:
1. The same action on the momentum coordinates as in the one-component
case, just using R = Φ(Ω), the SO(3) rotation corresponding to the
SU (2) group element Ω. For example, for a rotation about the x-axis
by angle φ we have
ψE,± (p) → ψE,± (R(φ, e1 )−1 p)
Recall that the operator that does this is e−iφL1 where


∂
∂
−iL1 = −i(Q2 P3 − Q3 P2 ) = − q2
− q3
∂q3
∂q2
and in general we have operators
−iL = −iQ × P
that provide the Lie algebra version of the representation (recall that
at the Lie algebra level, SO(3) and Spin(3) are isomorphic).
2. The action of the matrix Ω ∈ SU (2) on the two-component wavefunction by
ψE,± (p) → ΩψE,± (p)
For R a rotation by angle φ about the x-axis, one choice of Ω is
σ1

Ω = e−iφ 2

34.2


Solutions of the Pauli equation and representations of E(3)

427

and the operators that provide the Lie algebra version of the representation are the
1
−iS = −i σ
2
The Lie algebra representation corresponding to the action of these transformations on the two factors of the tensor product is given as usual (see
chapter 9) by a sum of operators that act on each factor
−iJ = −i(L + S)
The standard terminology is to call L the “orbital” angular momentum, S
the “spin” angular momentum, and J the “total” angular momentum.
The second Casimir operator for this case is
J·P
and as in the one-component case (see section 19.3), a straightforward calculation shows that the L·P part of this acts trivially on our solutions ψE,± (p).
The spin component acts non-trivially, and we have
1
1
(J · P)ψE,± (p) = ( σ · p)ψE,± (p) = ± |p|ψE,± (p)
2
2
so we see that our solutions have helicity (eigenvalue of J · P divided by the
square root of the eigenvalue of |P|2 ) values ± 12 , as opposed to the integral
helicity values discussed in chapter 19, where E(3) appeared and not its double cover. These two representations on the spaces of solutions ψE,± (p) are
 representations described in section 19.3, the ones labeled by
thus the E(3)
the helicity ± 21 representations of the stabilizer group SO(2).
Solutions for either sign of equation 34.6 are given by a one-dimensional
subspace of C2 for each p, and it is sometimes convenient to represent them
as follows. Note that for each p one can decompose
C2 = C ⊕ C
into ±-eigenspaces of the matrix σ·p
|p| . In our discussion of the Bloch sphere
in section 7.5, we explicitly found that (see equation 7.6)
u+ (p) =

1
2(1 + p3 )



1 + p3
p1 + ip2


(34.7)

provides a normalized element of the + eigenspace of σ·p
|p| that satisﬁes
Ωu+ (p) = u+ (Rp)

428

34 The Pauli Equation and the Dirac Operator

Similarly, we saw that
u− (p) =

1



2(1 + p3 )

−(p1 − ip2 )
1 + p3


(34.8)

provides such an element for the − eigenspace.
Another way to construct such elements is to use projection operators.
The operators
σ·p

)
P± (p) = (1 ±
2
|p|
provide projection operators onto these two spaces, since one can easily check
that
P+2 = P+ , P−2 = P− , P+ P− = P− P+ = 0, P+ + P− = 1
Solutions can now be written as
ψE,± (p) = αE,± (p)u± (p)

(34.9)

√
for arbitrary functions αE,± (p) on the sphere |p| = 2mE, where the u± (p)
in this context are called “spin polarization vectors.” There is, however, a subtlety involved in representing solutions in this manner. Recall from section 7.5
that u+ (p) is discontinuous at p3 = −1 (the same will be true for u− (p)) and
any unit-length eigenvector of σ·p must have such a discontinuity somewhere.
If αE,± (p) has a zero at p3 = −1, the product ψE,± (p) can be continuous. It
remains a basic topological fact that the combination ψE,± (p) must have a
zero, or it will have to be discontinuous. Our choice of u± (p) works well if this
zero is at p3 = −1, but if it is elsewhere one might want to make a diﬀerent
choice. In the end, one needs to check that computed physical quantities are
independent of such choices.
Keeping in mind the above subtlety, the u± (p) can be used to write an
arbitrary solution of the Pauli equation 34.3 of energy E as

αE,+ (p) on the sphere |p|2 = 2mE. This gives an explicit decomposition

In each case, the space of solutions is a complex vector space and one can
imagine trying to take it as a phase space (with the imaginary part of the
Hermitian inner product providing the symplectic structure) and quantizing.
This will be an example of a quantum ﬁeld theory, one discussed in more
detail in section 38.3.3.

34.4 The Dirac operator
The above construction can be generalized to the case of any dimension d as
follows. Recall from chapter 29 that associated to Rd with a standard inner
product, but of a general signature (r, s) (where r + s = d, r is the number of
+ signs, s the number of − signs), we have a Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(r, s) with
generators γj satisfying
γj γk = −γk γj , j = k
γj2 = +1 for j = 1, · · · , r

γj2 = −1, for j = r + 1, · · · , d

To any vector v ∈ Rd with components vj , recall that we can associate a
corresponding element v
/ in the Cliﬀord algebra by
v ∈ Rd → v
/=

d


γj vj ∈ Cliﬀ(r, s)

j=1

Multiplying this Cliﬀord algebra element by itself and using the relations
above, we get a scalar, the length-squared of the vector
2
2
v
− · · · − vd2 = |v|2
/ = v12 + v22 · · · + vr2 − vr+1

This shows that by introducing a Cliﬀord algebra, we can ﬁnd an interesting
new sort of square root for expressions like |v|2 . We can deﬁne:

in the spinor vector space S that the Cliﬀord algebra acts on. Picking a matrix
representation of the γj , the Dirac operator will be a constant coeﬃcient ﬁrstorder diﬀerential operator acting on wavefunctions with dim S components.
In chapter 47, we will study in detail what happens for the case of r = 3, s = 1
and see how the Dirac operator there provides an appropriate wave equation
with the symmetries of special relativistic space–time.

Dirac operator as the generator of a supersymmetry in the quantization of a
pseudo-classical system, see [90] and [1].

Lagrangian Methods and the Path
Integral

In this chapter, we will give a rapid survey of a diﬀerent starting point
for developing quantum mechanics, based on the Lagrangian rather than
Hamiltonian classical formalism. The Lagrangian point of view is the one
taken in most modern physics textbooks, and we will refer to these for
more detail, concentrating here on explaining the relation to the Hamiltonian
approach. Lagrangian methods have quite diﬀerent strengths and weaknesses
than those of the Hamiltonian formalism, and we will try and point these out.
The Lagrangian formalism leads naturally to an apparently very diﬀerent
notion of quantization, one based upon formulating quantum theory in terms
of inﬁnite dimensional integrals known as path integrals. A serious investigation of these would require another and very diﬀerent volume, so we will
have to restrict ourselves to a quick outline of how path integrals work, giving references to standard texts for the details. We will try and provide some
indication of both the advantages of the path integral method, as well as the
signiﬁcant problems it entails.

35.1 Lagrangian mechanics
In the Lagrangian formalism, instead of a phase space R2d of positions qj
and momenta pj , one considers just the position (or conﬁguration) space Rd .
Instead of a Hamiltonian function h(q, p), one has:

35 Lagrangian Methods and the Path Integral

Given diﬀerentiable paths in the conﬁguration space deﬁned by functions
γ : t ∈ [t1 , t2 ] → Rd
which we will write in terms of their position and velocity vectors as
γ(t) = (q(t), q̇(t))
one can deﬁne a functional on the space of such paths:
Definition (Action). The action S for a path γ is
 t2
S[γ] =

L(q(t), q̇(t))dt

t1

The fundamental principle of classical mechanics in the Lagrangian formalism is that classical trajectories are given by critical points of the action
functional. These may correspond to minima of the action (so this is sometimes called the “principle of least action”), but one gets classical trajectories
also for critical points that are not minima of the action. One can deﬁne the
appropriate notion of critical point as follows:
Definition (Critical point for S). A path γ is a critical point of the functional
S[γ] if
d
δS(γ) ≡
S(γs )|s=0 = 0
ds
where
γs : [t1 , t2 ] → Rd
is a smooth family of paths parametrized by an interval s ∈ (−, ), with
γ0 = γ.
We will now ignore analytical details and adopt the physicist’s interpretation of δS as the ﬁrst-order change in S due to an inﬁnitesimal change
δγ = (δq(t), δ q̇(t)) in the path.
When (q(t), q̇(t)) satisfy a certain diﬀerential equation, the path γ will be
a critical point and thus a classical trajectory:
Theorem (Euler–Lagrange equations). One has
δS[γ] = 0

This is just Newton’s second law, which says that the force due to a potential
is equal to the mass times the acceleration of the particle.
Given a Lagrangian classical mechanical system, one would like to be able
to ﬁnd a corresponding Hamiltonian system that will give the same equations of motion. To do this, we proceed by deﬁning (for each conﬁguration
coordinate qj ) a corresponding momentum coordinate pj by
pj =

∂L
∂ q̇j

Then, instead of working with trajectories characterized at time t by
(q(t), q̇(t)) ∈ R2d
we would like to instead use
(q(t), p(t)) ∈ R2d
2d
where pj = ∂∂L
(e.g., at t = 0) as the phase space of
q̇j and identify this R
the conventional Hamiltonian formalism.
The transformation


∂L
(qj , q̇k ) → qj , pk =

between position-velocity and phase space is known as the Legendre transform, and in good cases (for instance, when L is quadratic in all the velocities), it is an isomorphism. In general though, this is not an isomorphism,
with the Legendre transform often taking position-velocity space to a lower
dimensional subspace of phase space. Such cases are not unusual and require
a much more complicated formalism, even as classical mechanical systems
(this subject is known as “constrained Hamiltonian dynamics”). One important example we will study in Chapter 46 is that of the free electromagnetic
ﬁeld, with equations of motion the Maxwell equations. In that case, the conﬁguration space coordinates are the components (A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 ) of the vector
potential, with the problem arising because the Lagrangian does not depend
on Ȧ0 .
Besides a phase space, for a Hamiltonian system one needs a Hamiltonian
function. Choosing

will work, provided the relation
pj =

can be used to solve for the velocities q̇j and express them in terms of the
momentum variables. In that case, computing the diﬀerential of h one ﬁnds
(for d = 1, the generalization to higher d is straightforward)
dh =pdq̇ + q̇dp −

While the Legendre transform method given above works in some situations, more generally and more abstractly, one can pass from the Lagrangian
to the Hamiltonian formalism by taking as phase space the space of solutions
of the Euler–Lagrange equations. This is sometimes called the “covariant
phase space,” and it can often concretely be realized by ﬁxing a time t = 0
and parametrizing solutions by their initial conditions at such a t = 0. One
can also go directly from the action to a sort of Poisson bracket on this
covariant phase space (this is called the “Peierls bracket”). For a general
Lagrangian, one can pass to a version of the Hamiltonian formalism either
by this method or by the method of Hamiltonian mechanics with constraints.
Only for a special class of Lagrangians though will one get a non-degenerate
Poisson bracket on a linear phase space and recover the usual properties of
the standard Hamiltonian formalism.

35 Lagrangian Methods and the Path Integral

35.2 Noether’s theorem and symmetries
in the Lagrangian formalism
The derivation of the Euler–Lagrange equations given above can also be
used to study the implications of Lie group symmetries of a Lagrangian
system. When a Lie group G acts on the space of paths, preserving the
action S, it will take classical trajectories to classical trajectories, so we
have a Lie group action on the space of solutions to the equations of motion
(the Euler–Lagrange equations). On this space of solutions, we have, from
equation 35.1 (generalized to multiple coordinate variables),
⎛

δqj (X)⎠ (t2 )

where now δqj (X) is the inﬁnitesimal change in a classical trajectory coming
from the inﬁnitesimal group action by an element X in the Lie algebra of G.
From invariance of the action S under G, we must have δS=0, so

This is an example of a more general result known as “Noether’s theorem.”
In this context, it says that given a Lie group action on a Lagrangian system
that leaves the action invariant, for each element X of the Lie algebra we will
have a conserved quantity
d

∂L
δqj (X)
∂ q̇j
j=1
which is independent of time along the trajectory.
A basic example occurs when the Lagrangian is independent of the position
variables qj , depending only on the velocities q̇j , for example, in the case of
a free particle, when V (qj ) = 0. In such a case, one has invariance of the
Lagrangian under the Lie group Rd of space translations. Taking X to be an
inﬁnitesimal translation in the j-direction, one has as conserved quantity
∂L

∂ q̇j
For the case of the free particle, this will be
∂L

∂ q̇j

35.2

Noether’s theorem and symmetries in the Lagrangian formalism

439

and the conservation law is conservation of the jth component of momentum. Another example is given (in d = 3) by rotational invariance of the
Lagrangian under the group SO(3) acting by rotations of the qj . One can
show that, for X an inﬁnitesimal rotation about the k axis, the kth component of the angular momentum vector
q×p
will be a conserved quantity.
The Lagrangian formalism has the advantage that the dynamics depends
only on the choice of action functional on the space of possible trajectories,
and it can be straightforwardly generalized to theories where the conﬁguration space is an inﬁnite dimensional space of classical ﬁelds. Unlike the usual
Hamiltonian formalism for such theories, the Lagrangian formalism allows
one to treat space and time symmetrically. For relativistic ﬁeld theories, this
allows one to exploit the full set of space–time symmetries, which can mix
space and time directions. In such theories, Noether’s theorem provides a
powerful tool for ﬁnding the conserved quantities corresponding to symmetries of the system that are due to invariance of the action under some group
of transformations.
On the other hand, in the Lagrangian formalism, since Noether’s theorem
only considers group actions on conﬁguration space, it does not cover the case
of Hamiltonian group actions that mix position and momentum coordinates.
Recall that in the Hamiltonian formalism the moment map provides functions corresponding to group actions preserving the Poisson bracket. These
functions will give the same conserved quantities as the ones one gets from
Noether’s theorem for the case of symmetries (i.e., functions that Poissoncommute with the Hamiltonian function), when the group action is given by
an action on conﬁguration space.
As an important example not covered by Noether’s theorem, our study
of the harmonic oscillator exploited several techniques (use of a complex
structure on phase space, and of the U (1) symmetry of rotations in the qp
plane) that are unavailable in the Lagrangian formalism, which just uses
conﬁguration space, not phase space.

35.3 Quantization and path integrals
After use of the Legendre transform to pass to a Hamiltonian system, one
then faces the question of how to construct a corresponding quantum theory.
The method of “canonical quantization” is the one we have studied, taking
the position coordinates qj to operators Qj and momentum coordinates pj
to operators Pj , with Qj and Pj satisfying the Heisenberg commutation rela-

440

35 Lagrangian Methods and the Path Integral

tions. By the Stone von-Neumann theorem, up to unitary equivalence there
is only one way to do this and realize these operators on a state space H.
Recall though that the Groenewold-van Hove no-go theorem says that there
is an inherent operator ordering ambiguity for operators of higher order than
quadratic, thus for such operators providing many diﬀerent possible quantizations of the same classical system (diﬀerent though only by terms proportional to ). In cases where the Legendre transform is not an isomorphism, a
new set of problems appear when one tries to pass to a quantum system since
the standard method of canonical quantization will no longer apply, and new
methods are needed.
There is, however, a very diﬀerent approach to relating classical and quantum theories, which completely bypasses the Hamiltonian formalism, just
using the Lagrangian. This is the path integral formalism, which is based
upon a method for calculating matrix elements of the time evolution operator
i
qT |e−  HT |q0 
in the position eigenstate basis in terms of an integral over the space of
paths that go from position q0 to position qT in time T (we will here only
treat the d = 1 case). Here, |q0  is an eigenstate of Q with eigenvalue q0
(a delta-function at q0 in the position space representation), and |qT  has
Q eigenvalue qT . This matrix element has a physical interpretation as the
amplitude for a particle starting at q0 at t = 0 to have position qT at time T ,
with its norm-squared giving the probability density for observing the particle
at position qT . It is also the kernel function that allows one to determine the
wavefunction ψ(q, T ) at any time t = T in terms of its initial value at t = 0,
by calculating

Note that for the free particle case this is the propagator that we studied in

although one should not do the ﬁrst and last integrals over q but ﬁx the ﬁrst
value of q to q0 and the last one to qT . One can try and interpret this sort of
integration in the limit as an integral over the space of paths in phase space,
thus a “phase space path integral.”
This is an extremely simple and seductive expression, apparently saying
that, once the action S is speciﬁed, a quantum system is deﬁned just by
considering integrals

442

35 Lagrangian Methods and the Path Integral

nential just pdq and h(p, q), this formalism seems to share the same sort of
behavior under the inﬁnite dimensional group of canonical transformations
(transformations of the phase space preserving the Poisson bracket) as the
classical Hamiltonian formalism. It also appears to solve our problem with
operator ordering ambiguities, since the eﬀect of products of P and Q operators at various times can be computed by computing path integrals with
various p and q factors in the integrand. These integrand factors commute,
giving just one way of producing products at equal times of any number of
P and Q operators.
Unfortunately, we know from the Groenewold-van Hove theorem that this
is too good to be true. This expression cannot give a unitary representation
of the full group of canonical transformations, at least not one that is irreducible and restricts to what we want on transformations generated by linear
functions q and p. Another way to see the problem is that a simple argument
shows that by canonical transformations any Hamiltonian can be transformed
into a free particle Hamiltonian, so all quantum systems would just be free
particles in some choice of variables. For the details of these arguments and
a careful examination of what goes wrong, see chapter 31 of [77]. One aspect
of the problem is that for successive values of j the coordinates qtj or ptj
have no reason to be close together. This is an integral over “paths” that do
not acquire any expected continuity property as N → ∞, so the answer one
gets can depend on the details of the discretization chosen, reintroducing the
operator ordering ambiguity problem.
One can intuitively see that there is something disturbing about such
paths, since one is alternately at each time interval switching back and forth
between a q-space representation where q has a ﬁxed value and nothing is
known about p, and a p space representation where p has a ﬁxed value but
nothing is known about q. The “paths” of the limit are objects with little
relation to continuous paths in phase space, so while one may be able to deﬁne
the limit of equation 35.2, it will not necessarily have any of the properties
one expects of an integral over continuous paths.
When the Hamiltonian h is quadratic in the momentum p, the ptj integrals will be Gaussian integrals that can be performed exactly. Equivalently,
the kinetic energy part K of the Hamiltonian operator will have a kernel in
position space that can be computed exactly (see equation 12.9). As a result,
the ptj integrals can be eliminated, along with the problematic use of alternating q-space and p-space representations. The remaining integrals over the
qtj are then interpreted as a path integral over paths not in phase space, but
P2
in position space. One ﬁnds, if K = 2m

where now the paths γ(t) are paths in the position space.
An especially attractive aspect of this expression is that it provides a simple understanding of how classical behavior emerges in the classical limit
as  → 0. The stationary phase approximation method for oscillatory integrals says that, for a function f with a single critical point at x = xc (i.e.,
f  (xc ) = 0) and for a small parameter , one has

Using the same principle for the inﬁnite dimensional path integral, with f = S
the action functional on paths, and  = , one ﬁnds that for  → 0 the
path integral will simplify to something that just depends on the classical
trajectory, since by the principle of least action, this is the critical point of S.
Such position space path integrals do not have the problems of principle of
phase space path integrals coming from the Groenewold-van Hove theorem,
but they still have serious analytical problems since they involve an attempt
to integrate a wildly oscillating phase over an inﬁnite dimensional space.
Away from the limit  → 0, it is not clear that whatever results one gets will
be independent of the details of how one takes the limit to deﬁne the inﬁnite
dimensional integral or that one will naturally get a unitary result for the
time evolution operator.
One method for making path integrals better deﬁned is an analytic continuation in the time variable, as discussed in section 12.5 for the case of a
free particle. In such a free particle case, replacing the use of equation 12.9 by
equation 12.8 in the deﬁnition of the position space path integral, one ﬁnds
that this leads to a well-deﬁned measure on paths, Wiener measure. More
generally, Wiener measure techniques can be used to deﬁne the path integral
when the potential energy is nonzero, getting results that ultimately need to
be analytically continued back to the physical time variable.

444

35 Lagrangian Methods and the Path Integral

35.4 Advantages and disadvantages
of the path integral
In summary, the path integral method has the following advantages:
• An intuitive picture of the classical limit and a calculational method for
“semi-classical” eﬀects (quantum eﬀects at small ).
• Calculations for free particles or potentials V at most quadratic in
q can be done just using Gaussian integrals, and these are relatively
easy to evaluate and make sense of, despite the inﬁnite dimensionality
of the space of paths. For higher-order terms in V (q), one can get a
series expansion by expanding out the exponential, giving terms that
are moments of Gaussians so can be evaluated exactly.
• After analytical continuation, path integrals can be rigorously deﬁned
using Wiener measure techniques and often evaluated numerically even
in cases where no exact solution is known.
On the other hand, there are disadvantages:
• Some path integrals such as phase space path integrals do not at all have
the properties one might expect for an integral, so great care is required
in any use of them.
• How to get unitary results can be quite unclear. The analytic continuation necessary to make path integrals well deﬁned can make their
physical interpretation obscure.
• Symmetries with their origin in symmetries of phase space that are not
just symmetries of conﬁguration space are diﬃcult to see using the conﬁguration space path integral, with the harmonic oscillator providing a
good example. Such symmetries can be seen using the phase space path
integral, but this is not reliable.
Path integrals for anticommuting variables can also be deﬁned by analogy
with the bosonic case, using the notion of fermionic integration discussed
earlier. Such fermionic path integrals will usually be analogs of the phase
space path integral, but in the fermionic case there are no points and no
problem of continuity of paths. In this case, the “integral” is not really an
integral, but rather an algebraic operation with some of the same properties,
and it will not obviously suﬀer from the same problems as the phase space
path integral.

For much more about Lagrangian mechanics and its relation to the Hamiltonian formalism, see [2]. More details along the lines of the discussion here
can be found in most quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks. An extensive discussion at an introductory level of the Lagrangian
formalism and the use of Noether’s theorem to ﬁnd conserved quantities when
it is invariant under a group action can be found in [63]. For the formalism
of constrained Hamiltonian dynamics, see [89], and for a review article about
the covariant phase space and the Peierls bracket, see [50].
For the path integral, Feynman’s original paper [21] or his book [24] is
quite readable. A typical textbook discussion is the one in Chapter 8 of
Shankar [81]. The book by Schulman [77] has quite a bit more detail, both
about applications and about the problems of phase space path integrals. Yet
another fairly comprehensive treatment, including the fermionic case, is the
book by Zinn-Justin [109].

Chapter 36

Multiparticle Systems: Momentum
Space Description

In chapter 9, we saw how to use symmetric or antisymmetric tensor products to describe a ﬁxed number of identical quantum systems (for instance,
free particles). From very early on in the history of quantum mechanics,
it became clear that at least certain kinds of quantum particles, photons,
required a formalism that could describe arbitrary numbers of particles, as
well as phenomena involving their creation and annihilation. This could be
accomplished by thinking of photons as quantized excitations of a classical
electromagnetic ﬁeld. In our modern understanding of fundamental physics,
all elementary particles, not just photons, are best described in this way,
by quantum theories of ﬁelds. For free particles, the necessary theory can
be understood as the quantum theory of the harmonic oscillator, but with
an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, one for each possible value of the
momentum (or, Fourier transforming, each possible value of the position).
The symmetric (bosons) or antisymmetric (fermions) nature of multiparticle
quantum states is automatic in such a description as quanta of oscillators.
Conventional textbooks on quantum ﬁeld theory often begin with relativistic systems, but we will start instead with the non-relativistic case. This
is signiﬁcantly simpler, lacking the phenomenon of antiparticles that appears
in the relativistic case. It is also the case of relevance to condensed matter
physics and applies equally well to bosonic or fermionic particles.
Quantum ﬁeld theory is a large and complicated subject, suitable for a
full-year course at an advanced level. We will be giving only a very basic
introduction, mostly just considering free ﬁelds, which correspond to systems of non-interacting particles. Much of the complexity of the subject only
appears when one tries to construct quantum ﬁeld theories of interacting
particles.
For simplicity, we will start with the case of a single spatial dimension.
We will also begin using x to denote a spatial variable instead of the q conventional when this is the coordinate variable in a ﬁnite dimensional phase

space. In quantum ﬁeld theory, position or momentum variables parametrize
the fundamental degrees of freedom, the ﬁeld variables, rather than providing
such degrees of freedom themselves. In this chapter, emphasis will be on the
momentum parametrization and the description of collections of free particles
in terms of quanta of degrees of freedom labeled by momenta.

36.1 Multiparticle quantum systems
as quanta of a harmonic oscillator
It turns out that quantum systems of identical particles are best understood
by thinking of such particles as quanta of a harmonic oscillator system. We
will begin with the bosonic case and then later consider the fermionic case,
which uses the fermionic oscillator system.

36.1.1 Bosons and the quantum harmonic oscillator
A fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics (see chapter 9) is that given
a space of states H1 describing a bosonic single particle, a collection of N
identical such particles has state space
S N (H1 ) = (H‘ ⊗ · · · ⊗ H1 )S



N −times

where the superscript S means we take elements of the tensor product invariant under the action of the group SN by permutation of the N factors. To
describe states that include superpositions of an arbitrary number of identical
particles, one should take as state space the sum of these
S ∗ (H1 ) = C ⊕ H1 ⊕ (H1 ⊗ H1 )S ⊕ · · ·

(36.1)

This same symmetric part of a tensor product occurs in the Bargmann–
Fock construction of the quantum state space for a phase space M = R2d ,
where the Fock space Fd can be described in three diﬀerent but isomorphic
ways. Note that we generally will not take care to distinguish here between
Fdf in (superpositions of states with ﬁnite number of quanta) and its completion Fd (which includes states with an inﬁnite number of quanta). The three
diﬀerent descriptions of Fd are:
• Fd has an orthonormal basis
|n1 , n2 , · · · , nd 

1, · · · , d. Here, nj ∈ {0, 1, 2, · · · } and

is ﬁnite. This is called the “occupation number” basis of Fd . In this
basis, the annihilation and creation operators are
aj |n1 , n2 , · · · , nd  =

• Fd is the space of polynomials C[z1 , z2 , · · · , zd ] in d complex variables

with product the symmetrized tensor product given by equation 9.3.
Here, M+
J is the space of complex linear functions on M that are eigenvectors with eigenvalue +i for the complex structure J. Using the isomorphism between monomials and symmetric tensor products (given on
monomials in one variable by equation 9.4), the monomials 36.2 provide
an orthonormal basis of this space. Expressions for the annihilation and
creation operators acting on S ∗ (M+
J ) can be found using this isomorphism, using their action on monomials as derivative and multiplication
operators.
For each of these descriptions of Fd , the choice of orthonormal basis elements given above provides an inner product, with the annihilation and creation operators aj , a†j each other’s adjoints, satisfying the canonical commutation relations
[aj , a†k ] = δjk

450

36 Multiparticle Systems: Momentum Space Description

We will describe the basis state |n1 , n2 , · · · , nd  as one containing n1 quanta
of type 1, n2 quanta of type 2, etc., and a total number of quanta n.
Comparing 36.1 and 36.3, we see that these are the same state spaces if
H1 = M+
J . This construction of multiparticle states by taking as dual classical phase space M a space of solutions to a wave equation, then quantizing
by the Bargmann–Fock method, with H1 = M+
J the quantum state space
for a single particle, is sometimes known as “second quantization.” Choosing a (complex) basis of H1 , for each basis element one gets an independent
quantum harmonic oscillator, with corresponding occupation number, the
number of “quanta” labeled by that basis element. This formalism automatically implies indistinguishability of quanta and symmetry under interchange
of quanta since only the numbers of quanta appear in the description of the
state. The separate symmetry postulate needed in the conventional quantum
mechanical description of multiple identical particles by tensor products is
no longer needed.
In chapter 43, we will see that in the case of relativistic scalar quantum
ﬁeld theory, the dual phase space M will be the space of real solutions of
an equation called the Klein–Gordon equation. The J needed for Bargmann–
Fock quantization will be determined by the decomposition into positive and
negative energy solutions, and H1 = M+
J will be a space of states describing
a single relativistic particle.
In this chapter, we will consider a non-relativistic theory, with wave equation the Schrödinger equation. Here, the dual phase space M of complex
solutions will already be a complex vector space, and we can use the version
of Bargmann–Fock quantization described in section 26.4, so H1 = M. The
“second quantization” terminology is appropriate, since we take as (dual)
classical phase space a quantum state space, and quantize that.

36.1.2 Fermions and the fermionic oscillator
For the case of fermionic particles, if H1 is the state space for a single particle,
an arbitrary number of particles will be described by the state space
Λ∗ (H1 ) = C ⊕ H1 ⊕ (H1 ⊗ H1 )A ⊕ · · ·
where (unlike the bosonic case) this is a ﬁnite sum if H1 is ﬁnite dimensional.
One can proceed as in the bosonic case, using instead of Fd the fermionic
oscillator state space HF = Fd+ . This again has three isomorphic descriptions:
• Fd+ has an orthonormal basis
|n1 , n2 , · · · , nd 

36.1

Multiparticle quantum systems as quanta of a harmonic oscillator

451

labeled by the eigenvalues of the number operators Nj for j = 1, · · · , d
where nj ∈ {0, 1}. This is called the “occupation number” basis of Fd+ .

• Fd+ is the Grassmann algebra C[θ1 , θ2 , · · · , θd ] (see section 30.1) of polynomials in d anticommuting complex variables, with orthonormal basis
elements corresponding to the occupation number basis the monomials
θ1n1 θ2n2 · · · θdnd

(36.4)

• Fd+ is the algebra of antisymmetric multilinear forms
Λ∗ (VJ+ ) = C ⊕ VJ+ ⊕ (VJ+ ⊗ VJ+ )A ⊕ · · ·
discussed in section 9.6, with product the wedge product (see equation
9.6). Here, VJ+ is the space of complex linear functions on a vector space
V = R2d (the pseudo-classical phase space), eigenvectors with eigenvalue +i for the complex structure J.
For each of these descriptions of Fd+ , we have basis elements we can take
to be orthonormal, providing an inner product on Fd+ . We also have a set of
d annihilation and creation operators aF j , aF †j that are each other’s adjoints,
and satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations
[aF j , aF †k ]+ = δjk
We will describe the basis state |n1 , n2 , · · · , nd  as one containing n1 quanta
of type 1, n2 quanta of type 2, etc., and a total number of quanta
n=

d


nj

j=1

Analogously to the bosonic case, a multiparticle fermionic theory can be
constructed using Fd+ , by taking VJ+ = H1 . This is a fermionic version of
second quantization, with the multiparticle state space given by quantization
of a pseudo-classical dual phase space V of solutions to some wave equation.
The formalism automatically implies the Pauli principle (no more than one
quantum per state) as well as the antisymmetry property for states of multiple
fermionic quanta that is a separate postulate in our earlier description of
multiple particle states as tensor products.

452

36 Multiparticle Systems: Momentum Space Description

36.2 Multiparticle quantum systems
of free particles: ﬁnite cutoﬀ
formalism
To describe multiparticle quantum systems in terms of quanta of a harmonic
oscillator system, we would like to proceed as described in section 36.1, taking
solutions to the free particle Schrödinger equation (discussed in chapters 10
and 11) as the single-particle state space. Recall that for a free particle in
one spatial dimension, such solutions are given by complex-valued functions
on R, with observables the self-adjoint operators for momentum
P = −i

d
dx

and energy (the Hamiltonian)
H=

1 d2
P2
=−
2m
2m dx2

Eigenfunctions for both P and H are the functions of the form
ψp (x) ∝ eipx
2

p
for p ∈ R, with eigenvalues p for P and 2m
for H. Recall that these eigenfunctions are not normalizable and thus not in the conventional choice of
state space as L2 (R).
As we saw in section 11.1, one way to deal with this issue is to do what
physicists sometimes refer to as “putting the system in a box,” by imposing
periodic boundary conditions

ψ(x + L) = ψ(x)
for some number L, eﬀectively restricting the relevant values of x to be considered to those on an interval of length L. For our eigenfunctions, this condition is
eip(x+L) = eipx
so we must have
eipL = 1
which implies that
p=

for j an integer. Then, the momentum will take on a countable number of
discrete values corresponding to the j ∈ Z, and
1
1 2πj
|j = ψj (x) = √ eipj x = √ ei L x

L
will be orthonormal eigenfunctions satisfying
j  |j = δjj 
This use of periodic boundary conditions is one form of what physicists call
an “infrared cutoﬀ,” a way of removing degrees of freedom that correspond
to arbitrarily large sizes, in order to make the quantum system well deﬁned.
One starts with a ﬁxed value of L and only later studies the limit L → ∞.
The number of degrees of freedom is now countable, but still inﬁnite, and
something more must be done in order to make the single-particle state space
ﬁnite dimensional. This can be accomplished with an additional cutoﬀ, an
“ultraviolet cutoﬀ,” which means restricting attention to |p| ≤ Λ for some
ﬁnite Λ, or equivalently |j| < ΛL
2π . This makes the space of solutions ﬁnite
dimensional, allowing quantization by the use of the Bargmann–Fock method
used for the ﬁnite dimensional harmonic oscillator. The Λ → ∞ and L → ∞
limits can then be taken at the end of a calculation.
The Schrödinger equation is a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation in time, t,

Our space of solutions is the space of all sets of complex numbers α(pj ).
In principle, we could take this space as our dual phase space and quantize
using the Schrödinger representation, for instance taking the real parts of
the α(pj ) as position-like coordinates. Especially since our dual phase space
is already complex, it is much more convenient to use the Bargmann–Fock
method of quantization. Recalling the discussion of section 26.4, we will need
both a dual phase space M and its conjugate space M, which means that
we will need to consider not just solutions of the Schrödinger equation, but
of its conjugate


α(pk ) = 0 k = j
A(pj ) =

with conjugates A(pj ) a basis for M. The Poisson bracket on M ⊕ M will
be determined by the following Poisson bracket relations on basis elements
{A(pj ), A(pk )} = {A(pj ), A(pk )} = 0, {A(pj ), A(pk )} = iδjk

Bargmann–Fock quantization gives as state space a Fock space FD , where
D is the number of values of pj . This is (ignoring issues of completion) the
space of polynomials in the D variables A(pj ). One has a pair of annihilation
and creation operators
a(pj ) =

∂

∂A(pj )

for each possible value of j, which indexes the possible values pj . These
operators satisfy the commutation relations
[a(pj ), a(pj )† ] = δjk

basis elements are

The occupation number npj is the eigenvalue of the operator a(pj )† a(pj ) and
takes values 0, 1, 2, · · · , ∞. It has a physical interpretation as the number of
particles in the state with momentum pj (recall that such momentum values
are discretized in units of 2π
L and in the interval [−Λ, Λ]). The state with all
occupation numbers equal to zero is denoted
| · · · , 0, 0, 0, · · ·  = |0

With ultraviolet and infrared cutoﬀs in place, the possible values of pj
are of a ﬁnite number D which is also the complex dimension of H1 . The
Hamiltonian operator is the standard harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, with
diﬀerent frequencies

for diﬀerent values of j. Note that we are using normal-ordered operators
here, which is necessary since, in the limit as one or both cutoﬀs are removed,
H1 becomes inﬁnite dimensional, and only the normal-ordered version of the
Hamiltonian used here is well deﬁned (the non-normal-ordered version will
diﬀer by an inﬁnite sum of 21 s).
Everything in this section has a straightforward analog describing a multiparticle system of fermionic particles with energy–momentum relation given
by the free particle Schrödinger equation. The annihilation and creation operators will be the fermionic ones, satisfying the canonical anticommutation
relations
[aF pj , aF †pk ]+ = δjk
implying that states will have occupation numbers npj = 0, 1, automatically
implementing the Pauli principle.

36.3 Continuum formalism
The use of cutoﬀs allows for a ﬁnite dimensional phase space and makes it possible to straightforwardly use the Bargmann–Fock quantization method. Such
cutoﬀs, however, introduce very signiﬁcant problems, by making unavailable
some of the continuum symmetries and mathematical structures that we
would like to exploit. In particular, the use of an infrared cutoﬀ (periodic
boundary conditions) makes the momentum space a discrete set of points,
and this set of points will not have the same symmetries as the usual continuous momentum space (for instance, in three dimensions, it will not carry an
action of the rotation group SO(3)). In our study of quantum ﬁeld theory, we
would like to exploit the action of space–time symmetry groups on the state
space of the theory, so need a formalism that preserves such symmetries. In
this section, we will outline such a formalism, without attempting a detailed
rigorous version. One reason for this choice is that for the case of physically
interesting interacting quantum ﬁeld theories, this continuum formalism is
inadequate, since a rigorous deﬁnition will require ﬁrst deﬁning a ﬁnite, cutoﬀ version, then using renormalization group methods to analyze the very
non-trivial continuum limit.
If we try and work directly with the inﬁnite dimensional space of solutions of the free Schrödinger equation, for the three forms of the Fock space
construction discussed in section 36.1.1, we ﬁnd:
• The occupation number construction of Fock space is not available (since
it requires a discrete basis).

36.3

Continuum formalism

457

• For the Bargmann–Fock holomorphic function state space and inner
product on it, one needs to make sense of holomorphic functions on
an inﬁnite dimensional space, as well as the Gaussian measure on this
space. See section 36.6 for references that discuss this.
• For the symmetric tensor product representation, one needs to make
sense of symmetric tensor products of inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces
H1 and the induced Hilbert space structure on such tensor products. We
will adopt this point of view here, with details available in the references
of section 36.6.

which is the Fourier inversion formula, expressing a function ψ(x, 0) in terms

of its Fourier transform, α(p) = ψ(x,
0)(p). We see that the functions α(p)
parametrize initial data and H1 , the solution space of the free particle
Schrödinger equation, can be identiﬁed with the space of such α.
Using the notation A(α) to denote the element of H1 determined by initial
data α, in the Fock space description of multiparticle states as symmetric tensor products of H1 , we have the following annihilation and creation operators
(these were discussed in the ﬁnite dimensional case in section 26.4)

36 Multiparticle Systems: Momentum Space Description

Diﬀerent choices for which space of functions α to take as H1 lead to
diﬀerent problems. Three possibilities are:
• H1 = L2 (R)
This choice allows for an isomorphism between H1 and its dual, using
the inner product
α1 , α2  =

α1 (p)α2 (p)dp

As in the single-particle case the problem here is that position

1
α(p) = √ eipx
2π

and momentum

α(p) = δ(p − p )

eigenstates are not in H1 = L2 (R). In addition, as in the single-particle
case, there are domain issues to consider, since diﬀerentiating by p or
multiplying by p can take something in L2 (R) to something not in
L2 (R).
• H1 = S(R)
This choice, taking α to be in the well-behaved space of Schwartz functions, avoids the domain issues of L2 (R) and the Hermitian inner product is well deﬁned. It, however, shares the problem with L2 (R) of not
including position or momentum eigenstates. In addition, the inner product no longer provides an isomorphism of H1 with its dual.
• H1 = S  (R)
This choice, allowing α to be distributional solutions, will solve domain
issues and includes position and momentum eigenstates. It, however,
introduces a serious problem: The Hermitian inner product on functions
does not extend to distributions. With this choice, H1 is not an inner
product space and neither are its symmetric tensor products.
To get a rigorous mathematical formalism, for some purposes it is possible
to adopt the ﬁrst choice, H1 = L2 (R). With this choice, the symmetric tensor
product version of the Fock space can be given a Hilbert space structure, with
operators a† (α) and a(α) deﬁned by equations 36.12 and 36.13 satisfying the
Heisenberg commutation relations of equation 36.14. We will, however, want
to consider operators quadratic in the a(α) and a† (α), and for these to be
well deﬁned, we may need to use H1 = S(R).
If we ignore the problem with the inner product, and take H1 = S  (R),
then in particular we can take α to be a delta-function, and when doing this,
we will use the notation

36.3

Continuum formalism

459

a(p) = a(δ(p − p)), a† (p) = a† (δ(p − p))
and write
a(α) =

α(p)a(p)dp, a† (α) =

α(p)a† (p)dp

(36.15)

The choice of the conjugations here reﬂects that fact that a† (α) is complex
linear in α, a(α) complex antilinear.
While the operator a(p) may be well deﬁned, the problem with the operator a† (p) is clear: It takes in particular the vacuum state |0 to the nonnormalizable state |p. We will, like most other authors, often write equations
in terms of operators a(p) and a† (p), acting as if H1 = S  (R). For a legitimate
interpretation though, such equations will always require an interpretation
either
• using cutoﬀs which make the values of p discrete and of ﬁnite number,
pj labeled by an index j with a ﬁnite number of values, as in section
36.2. In this case, the a(p), a† (p) are the a(pj ), a† (pj ) of that section.
• using equations 36.15 formally, with a(α) and a† (α) the objects that are
well deﬁned, for some speciﬁed class of functions α, generally S(R). In
this case, the a(p), a† (p) are often described as “operator-valued distributions.”
The nonzero commutators of a(p), a† (p) can be written as
[a(p), a† (p )] = δ(p − p )
a formula that should be interpreted as meaning either a continuum limit of
[a(pj ), a† (pk )] = δjk
or
[a(α1 ), a† (α2 )] =
=
=

α1 (p)a(p)dp,

α2 (p )a(p )dp



α1 (p)α2 (p )δ(p − p )dpdp
α1 (p)α2 (p)dp = α1 , α2 

for some class (e.g., S(R) or L2 (R)) of functions for which the inner product
of α1 and α2 makes sense.
While we have deﬁned here ﬁrst the quantum theory in terms of a state
space and operators, one could instead start by writing down a classical
theory, with dual phase space H1 . This is already a complex vector space
with Hermitian inner product, so we are in the situation described for the

460

36 Multiparticle Systems: Momentum Space Description

ﬁnite dimensional case in section 26.4. We need to apply Bargmann–Fock
quantization in the manner described there, introducing a complex conjugate
space H1 , as well as a symplectic structure and indeﬁnite Hermitian inner
product on H1 ⊕ H1 . Restricted to H1 , the Hermitian inner product will be
the given one, and the symplectic structure will be its imaginary part.
If we denote by A(α) ∈ H1 the solution of the Schrödinger equation with
Fourier transform of initial data given by α, and by A(α) ∈ H1 the conjugate
solution of the conjugate Schrödinger equation, the Poisson bracket relations
are then
{A(α1 ), A(α2 )} = {A(α1 ), A(α2 )} = 0,

{A(α1 ), A(α2 )} = i α1 , α2 
(36.16)

Quantization then takes
A(α) → −ia† (α),

A(α) → −ia(α)

where a† (α) and a(α) are given by equations 36.12 and 36.13. This gives a
representation of the Lie algebra relations 36.16 for an inﬁnite dimensional
Heisenberg Lie algebra.
As with annihilation and creation operators, adopting a notation that
formally extends the state space to H1 = S  (R), we deﬁne
A(p) = A(δ(p − p)), A(p) = A(δ(p − p))
α(p)A(p)dp, A(α) =

A(α) =

α(p)A(p)dp

with Poisson bracket relations written
{A(p), A(p )} = {A(p), A(p } = 0, {A(p), A(p )} = iδ(p − p )

(36.17)

To get observables, we would like to deﬁne quadratic products of operators
such as
+∞

N=

a(p)† a(p)dp

for the number operator,
+∞

P =

pa(p)† a(p)dp

for the momentum operator, and

H=

36.3

for the Hamiltonian operator. One way to make rigorous sense of these is as
limits of the operators 36.8, 36.9, and 36.10. Another is as bilinear forms on
S ∗ (H1 ) × S ∗ (H1 ) for H1 = S(R), sending pairs of states |φ1 , |φ2  to, for
instance, φ1 |N |φ2  (for details see [17], section 5.4.2).

36.4 Multiparticle wavefunctions
To recover the conventional formalism in which an N -particle state is
described by a wavefunction
ψN (p1 , p2 , · · · , pN )
symmetric in the N arguments, one needs to recall (see chapter 9) that the
tensor product of the vector space of functions on a set X1 and the vector
space of functions on a set X2 is the vector space of functions on the product
set X1 × X2 . The symmetric tensor product will be the symmetric functions.
Applying this to whatever space H1 of functions on R we choose to use, the
symmetric tensor product S N (H1 ) will be a space of symmetric functions on
RN . For details of this construction, see, for instance, chapter 5 of [17].
From the point of view of distributional operators a(p), a† (p), given an
arbitrary state |ψ in the multiparticle state space, the momentum space
wavefunction component with particle number N can be expressed as
ψN (p1 , p2 , · · · , pN ) = 0|a(p1 )a(p2 ) · · · a(pN )|ψ

36.5 Dynamics
To describe the time evolution of a quantum ﬁeld theory system, it is generally
easier to work with the Heisenberg picture (in which the time-dependence is in
the operators) than the Schrödinger picture (in which the time-dependence
is in the states). This is especially true in relativistic systems where one
wants to as much as possible treat space and time on the same footing. It
is, however, also true in the case of non-relativistic multiparticle systems
due to the complexity of the description of the states (inherent since one is
trying to describe arbitrary numbers of particles) versus the description of
the operators, which are built simply out of the annihilation and creation
operators.

462

36 Multiparticle Systems: Momentum Space Description

In the Heisenberg picture, the time evolution of an operator f is given by
f (t) = eiHt f (0)e−iHt
and such operators satisfy the diﬀerential equation
d
f = [f , −iH]
dt
For the operators that create and annihilate states with momentum pj in the
ﬁnite cutoﬀ formalism of section 36.2, H = H (given by equation 36.10) and
we have

a (pj , t) = [a† (pj , t), −iH] = i
a (pj , t)

a† (pj , t) = ei 2m t a† (pj , 0)

(36.18)

Recall that in classical Hamiltonian mechanics, the Hamiltonian function
h determines how an observable f evolves in time by the diﬀerential equation
d
f = {f, h}
dt
Quantization takes f to an operator f and h to a self-adjoint operator H.
In our case, the “classical” dynamical equation is meant to be the
Schrödinger equation. In the ﬁnite cutoﬀ formalism, one can take as Hamiltonian
 p2j
A(pj )A(pj )
h=
2m

Here, the A(pj ) should be interpreted as linear functions that on a solution
given by α take the value αj , and h a quadratic function on solutions that
takes the value

In the continuum formalism, one can write

A(p)A(p)dp

which should be interpreted as a limit of the ﬁnite cutoﬀ version. We will
not try and give a rigorous continuum interpretation of a quadratic product
of distributions such as this one. As discussed at the end of section 36.3, the
quantization of h can be given a rigorous interpretation as a bilinear form.
We will, however, assume the A(pj , t) have as continuum limits distributions
A(p, t) that satisfy
d
p2
A(p, t) = i
A(p, t)
dt
2m
so have time-dependence
p2

A(p, t) = ei 2m t A(p, 0)
Note that this time-dependence is opposite to that of the Schrödinger solud
A(p, t) evaluated on a function f is A(p, t)

36.6 For further reading
The material of this chapter is just the conventional multiparticle formalism
described or implicit in most quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks. Many do not
explicitly discuss the non-relativistic case, two that do are [35] and [45]. Three
books aimed at mathematicians that cover this subject much more comprehensively than done here are [28] and [17]. For example, section 4.5 of [28]
gives a detailed description of the bosonic and fermionic Fock space constructions in terms of tensor products. For a rigorous version of the construction
of annihilation and creation operators as operator-valued distributions, see,
for instance, section 5.4 of [17], chapter X.7 of [73], or [64]. The construction of the Fock space in the inﬁnite dimensional case using Bargmann–Fock
methods of holomorphic functions (rather than tensor products) goes back
to Berezin [6] and Segal (for whom it is the “complex-wave representation,”
see [4]) and is explained in chapter 6 of [61].
Some good sources for learning about quantum ﬁeld theory from the point
of view of non-relativistic many-body theory are Feynman’s lecture notes on
statistical mechanics [23], as well as [53] and [86].

Chapter 37

Multiparticle Systems and Field
Quantization

The multiparticle formalism developed in chapter 36 is based on the idea
of taking as dual phase space the space of solutions to the free particle
Schrödinger equation, then quantizing using the Bargmann–Fock method.
Continuous basis elements A(p), A(p) are momentum operator eigenstates
which after quantization become creation and annihilation operators a† (p),
a(p). These act on the multiparticle state space by adding or subtracting a
free particle of momentum p.
Instead of the solutions A(p), which are momentum space delta-functions
localized at p at t = 0, one could use solutions Ψ(x) that are position space
delta-functions localized at x at t = 0. Quantization using these basis ele † (x)
ments of H1 (and conjugate basis elements of H1 ) will give operators Ψ

and Ψ(x), which are the quantum ﬁeld operators. These are related to the
operators a† (p), a(p) by the Fourier transform.

 † (x) can be given a physical interpretation as
The operators Ψ(x)
and Ψ
acting on states by subtracting or adding a particle localized at x. Such
states with localized position have the same problem of non-normalizability as
momentum eigenstates. In addition, unlike states with ﬁxed momentum, they
are not stable energy eigenstates so will immediately evolve into something
non-localized (just as in the single-particle case discussed in section 12.5).
Quantum ﬁelds are, however, very useful in the study of theories of interacting particles, since the interactions in such theories are typically local,
taking place at a point x and describable by adding terms to the Hamiltonian operator involving multiplying ﬁeld operators at the same point x.
The diﬃculties involved in properly deﬁning products of these operators and
calculating their dynamical eﬀects will keep us from starting the study of
such interacting theories.

37 Multiparticle Systems and Field Quantization

37.1 Quantum field operators
The multiparticle formalism developed in chapter 36 works well to describe
states of multiple free particles, but does so purely in terms of states with welldeﬁned momenta, with no information at all about their position. Instead of
starting with t = 0 momentum eigenstates |p and corresponding Schrödinger
solutions A(p) as continuous basis elements of the single-particle space H1 ,
the position operator Q eigenstates |x could be used. The solution that is
such an eigenstate at t = 0 will be denoted Ψ(x); the conjugate solution
will be written as Ψ(x). The Ψ(x), Ψ(x) can be thought of as the complex
coordinates of an oscillator for each value of x.
The corresponding quantum state space would naively be a Fock space for
an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, with an occupation number for each
value of x. This could be made well deﬁned by introducing a spatial cutoﬀ
and discretizing space, so that x only takes on a ﬁnite number of values. However, such states in the occupation number basis would not be free particle
energy eigenstates. While a state with a well-deﬁned momentum evolves as
a state with the same momentum, a state with well-deﬁned position at some
time does not evolve into states with well-deﬁned positions (its wavefunction
immediately spreads out).
One does, however, want to be able to discuss states with well-deﬁned
positions, in order to describe amplitudes for particle propagation, and to
introduce local interactions between particles. One approach is to try and
deﬁne operators corresponding to creation or annihilation of a particle at a
ﬁxed position, by taking a Fourier transform of the annihilation and creation
operators for momentum eigenstates. Quantum ﬁelds could be deﬁned as

Note that, just like a(p) and a† (p), these are not self-adjoint operators, and
thus not themselves observables, but physical observables can be constructed
by taking simple (typically quadratic) combinations of them. As explained
in section 36.5, for multiparticle systems, the state space H is complicated
to describe and work with; it is the operators that behave simply. These will

 † (x), or annihilation
generally be built out of either the ﬁeld operators Ψ(x),

and creation operators a(p), a (p), with the Fourier transform relating the two
possibilities.

getting results consistent with the interpretation of the ﬁeld operator and its
adjoint as operators that annihilate and create particles at a point x.
This sort of deﬁnition relies upon making sense of the operators a(p) and
a† (p) as distributional operators, using the action of elements of H1 and H1
on Fock space given by equations 36.12 and 36.13. We could instead more
directly proceed exactly as in section 36.3 but with solutions characterized by
initial data given by a function ψ(x) rather than its Fourier transform α(p).
One gets all the same objects and formulas, related by Fourier transform.
Our notation for these transformed objects will be
α(p) → ψ(x), α(p) → ψ(x)
A(α) → Ψ(ψ), A(α) → Ψ(ψ)
A(p) → Ψ(x), A(p) → Ψ(x)
Ψ(ψ) will be the solution in H1 with initial data ψ(x) and Ψ(ψ) the conjugate solution in H1 . Ψ(x) can be interpreted as the distributional solution
equal to δ(x − x ) at t = 0, and we can write



Ψ(ψ) =

ψ(x)Ψ(x)dx, Ψ(ψ) =

These satisfy the Poisson bracket relations

The propagator in non-relativistic quantum field theory

37.3 The propagator in non-relativistic
quantum field theory
In quantum ﬁeld theory, the Heisenberg picture operators that provide
observables will be products of the ﬁeld operators, and the time-dependence
of these for the free particle theory was determined in section 37.2. For the
time-independent state, the natural choice is the vacuum state |0, although
other possibilities such as coherent states may also be useful. States with a
ﬁnite number of particles will be given by applying ﬁeld operators to the vacuum, so such states just corresponds to a diﬀerent product of ﬁeld operators.
We will not enter here into details, but a standard topic in quantum ﬁeld
theory textbooks is “Wick’s theorem,” which says that the calculation of
expectation values of products of ﬁeld operators in the state |0 can be
reduced to the problem of calculating the following special case:

The physical interpretation of these functions is that they describe the

at time t1 , propagates for a time t2 − t1 , and is annihilated at position x2 .

If we extend the deﬁnition of U (t, x2 − x1 ) to t < 0 by taking it to be zero
there, as in section we get the retarded propagator U+ (t, x2 − x1 ) and its
Fourier transformed version in frequency–momentum space of section 12.6 as
well as the relation to Green’s functions of section 12.7.

For Hamiltonians quadratic in the quantum ﬁelds, quantum ﬁeld theories
are relatively tractable objects. They are in some sense decoupled quantum
oscillator systems, although with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom.
Higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian are what makes quantum ﬁeld theory
a diﬃcult and complicated subject; one that requires a year-long graduate
level course to master basic computational techniques, and one that to this
day resists mathematician’s attempts to prove that many examples of such
theories have even the basic expected properties. In the quantum theory of
charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic ﬁeld (see chapter 45),
when the electromagnetic ﬁeld is treated classically, one still has a Hamiltonian quadratic in the ﬁeld operators for the particles. But if the electromagnetic ﬁeld is treated as a quantum system, it acquires its own ﬁeld operators,
and the Hamiltonian is no longer quadratic in the ﬁelds but instead gives an
interacting quantum ﬁeld theory.
Even if one restricts attention to the quantum ﬁelds describing one kind
of particle, there may be interactions between particles that add terms to the
Hamiltonian that will be higher order than quadratic. For instance, if there
is an interaction between such particles described by an interaction energy
v(y − x), this can be described by adding the following quartic term to the

Digression (The Lagrangian density and the path integral). While we have

but, as expected for a case where the equation of motion is first order in
time, the canonical momentum coordinate iΨ(x) is not independent of the
coordinate Ψ(x). The space H1 of wavefunctions is already a phase space
rather than just a configuration space, and one does not need to introduce
new momentum variables. One could try and quantize this system by path
integral methods, for instance computing the propagator by doing the integral

over paths in H1 parametrized by t, taking values from t = 0 to t = T . This
is a highly infinite dimensional integral, over paths in an infinite dimensional
space. In addition, recall the warnings given in chapter 35 about the problematic nature of path integrals over paths in a phase space, which is the case
here.

37.5 Fermion fields
Most everything discussed in this chapter and in chapter 36 applies with
little change to the case of fermionic quantum ﬁelds using fermionic instead
of bosonic oscillators, and changing commutators to anticommutators for the
annihilation and creation operator. This gives fermionic ﬁelds that satisfy
anticommutation relations

 † (x )]+ = δ(x − x )

and states that in the occupation number representation have np = 0, 1,
while also having a description in terms of antisymmetric tensor products, or
polynomials in anticommuting coordinates. Field operators will in this case
generate an inﬁnite dimensional Cliﬀord algebra. Elements of this Cliﬀord
algebra act on states by an inﬁnite dimensional version of the construction
of spinors in terms of fermionic oscillators described in chapter 31.
For applications to physical systems in three-dimensional space, it is often
the fermionic version that is relevant, with the systems of interest for instance
describing arbitrary numbers of electrons, which are fermionic particles so
need to be described by anticommuting ﬁelds. The quantum ﬁeld theory of
non-relativistic free electrons is the quantum theory one gets by taking as
single-particle phase space H1 the space of solutions of the two-component
Pauli–Schrödinger equation 34.3 described in section 34.2 and then quantizing
using the fermionic version of Bargmann–Fock quantization. The fermionic
Poisson bracket is determined by the inner product on this H1 discussed in
section 34.3.

The theory of non-relativistic electrons is something diﬀerent than simply
two copies of a single fermionic ﬁeld, since it describes spin 12 particles, not

pairs of spin 0 particles. In section 38.3.3, we will see how the group E(3)
acts on the theory, giving angular momentum observables corresponding to
spin 12 rather than two copies of spin 0.

37.6 For further reading
See the same references at the end of chapter 36 for more details about the
material of this one. A discussion of the physics described by the formalism
of this chapter can be found in most quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks and in
textbooks dealing with the many-particle formalism and condensed matter
theory. Two textbooks that explicitly discuss the non-relativistic case are [35]
and [45].

Chapter 38

Symmetries and Non-relativistic
Quantum Fields

In our study (chapters 25 and 26) of quantization using complex structures
on phase space, we found that using the Poisson bracket, quadratic polynomials of the (complexiﬁed) phase space coordinates provided a symplectic Lie
algebra sp(2d, C), with a distinguished gl(d, C) sub-Lie algebra determined
by the complex structure (see section 25.2). In section 25.3, we saw that these
quadratic polynomials could be quantized as quadratic combinations of the
annihilation and creation operators, giving a representation on the harmonic
oscillator state space, one that was unitary on the unitary sub-Lie algebra
u(d) ⊂ gl(d, C).
The non-relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory of chapters 36 and 37 is an inﬁnite dimensional version of this, with the dual phase space now the space H1
of solutions of the Schrödinger equation. When a group G acts on H1 preserving the Hermitian inner product (and thus the symplectic and complex
structures), generalizing the formulas of sections 25.2 and 25.3 should give
a unitary representation of such a group G on the multiparticle state space
S ∗ (H1 ).
In sections 36.5 and 37.2, we saw how this works for G = R, the group
of time translations, which determines the dynamics of the theory. For the
case of a free particle, the ﬁeld theory Hamiltonian is a quadratic polynomial
of the ﬁelds, providing a basic example of how such polynomials provide
a unitary representation on the states of the quantum theory by use of a
quadratic combination of the quantum ﬁeld operators. In this chapter, we
will see some other examples of how group actions on the single-particle
space H1 lead to quadratic operators and unitary transformations on the full
quantum ﬁeld theory. The moment map for these group actions gives the
quadratic polynomials on H1 , which after quantization become the quadratic
operators of the Lie algebra representation.

38 Symmetries and Non-relativistic Quantum Fields

38.1 Unitary transformations on H1
The single-particle state space H1 of non-relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory
can be parametrized by either wavefunctions ψ(x) or their Fourier transforms


and carries a Hermitian inner product

ψ1 , ψ2  =


ψ1 (x)ψ2 (x)dx =

ψ1 (p)ψ2 (p)dp

As a dual phase space, the symplectic structure is given by the imaginary
part of this

1
(ψ1 (x)ψ2 (x) − ψ2 (x)ψ1 (x))dx
Ω(ψ1 , ψ2 ) =
2i
There is an inﬁnite dimensional symplectic group that acts on H1 by linear transformations that preserve Ω. It has an inﬁnite dimensional unitary
subgroup, those transformations preserving the full inner product. In this
chapter, we will consider various ﬁnite dimensional groups G that are subgroups of this unitary group, and see how they are represented on the quantum ﬁeld theory state space. Note that there are also groups that act as
symplectic but not unitary transformations of H1 , after quantization acting
by a unitary representation on the multiparticle state space. Such actions
change particle number, and the vacuum state |0 in particular will not be
invariant. For some indications of what happen in this more general situation,
see sections 25.5 and 39.4.
The ﬁnite dimensional version of the case of unitary transformations of
H1 was discussed in detail in sections 25.2 and 25.3 where we saw that the
moment map for the U (d) action was given by
μA = i



for A a skew-adjoint matrix. Quantization took this quadratic function

and exponentiation of these operators gave the unitary representation on
state space.
In the quantum ﬁeld theory case with dual phase space H1 , the generalization of the ﬁnite dimensional case will be



a†j → Ψ
The quadratic functions we will consider will be “local,” multiplying elements
parametrized by the same points in position space. Often these will be diﬀerential operators. As a result, the generalization from the ﬁnite dimensional
case will take

Ajk → O(x) or O(p)

38.2 Internal symmetries
Since the phase space H1 is a space of complex functions, there is an obvious
group that acts unitarily on this space: the group U (1) of phase transformations of the complex values of the function. Such a group action that acts
trivially on the spatial coordinates but non-trivially on the values of ψ(x)
is called an “internal symmetry.” If the ﬁelds ψ have multiple components,
taking values in Cn , there will be a unitary action of the larger group U (n).

38.2.1 U (1) symmetry
In chapter 2, we saw that the fact that irreducible representations of U (1) are
labeled by integers is responsible for the term “quantization”: Since quantum
states are representations of this group, they break up into states characterized by integers, with these integers counting the number of “quanta.” In the
non-relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, this integer will be the total particle
number. Such a theory can be thought of as a harmonic oscillator with an
inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, and the total particle number is the
total occupation number, summed over all degrees of freedom.
Consider the U (1) action on the ﬁelds Ψ(x), Ψ(x) given by
Ψ(x) → e−iθ Ψ(x), Ψ(x) → eiθ Ψ(x)

(38.1)

This is an inﬁnite dimensional generalization of the case worked out in section
24.2, where recall that the moment map was μ = zz and

480

38 Symmetries and Non-relativistic Quantum Fields

{zz, z} = iz {zz, z} = −iz
There were two possible choices for the unitary operator that will be the
quantization of zz:
•

i
zz → − (a† a + aa† )
2
This will have eigenvalues −i(n + 12 ), n = 0, 1, 2 . . ..

•

zz → −ia† a
This is the normal-ordered form, with eigenvalues −in.

With either choice, we get a number operator
N=

1 †
1
(a a + aa† ), or N = :(a† a + aa† ): = a† a
2
2

In both cases, we have
[N, a] = −a, [N, a† ] = a†
so

eiθN ae−iθN = e−iθ a, eiθN a† e−iθN = eiθ a†

Either choice of N will give the same action on operators. However, on states
only the normal-ordered one will have the desirable feature that
N |0 = 0, eiN θ |0 = |0
Since we now want to treat ﬁelds, adding together an inﬁnite number of such
oscillator degrees of freedom, we will need the normal-ordered version in order
to not get ∞ · 12 as the number eigenvalue for the vacuum state.

deﬁnition, or by giving it a distributional interpretation.

saw in section 25.2, the n2 quadratic combinations zj z k for j = 1, . . . , n, k =
1, . . . , n will generalize the role played by zz in the n = 1 case, with their
Poisson bracket relations exactly the Lie bracket relations of the Lie algebra
u(n) (or, considering all complex linear combinations, gl(n, C)).
After quantization, these quadratic combinations become quadratic combinations of annihilation and creation operators aj , a†j satisfying
[aj , a†k ] = δjk

38.3 Spatial symmetries
We saw in chapter 19 that the action of the group E(3) on physical space
R3 induces a unitary action on the space H1 of solutions to the free particle
Schrödinger equation. Quantization of this phase space with this group action
produces a multiparticle state space carrying a unitary representation of the
group E(3). There are several diﬀerent actions of the group E(3) that one
needs to keep track of here. Given an element (a, R) ∈ E(3), one has:
• An action on R3 , by

x → Rx + a

• A unitary action on H1 induced by the action on R3 , given by
ψ(x) → u(a, R)ψ(x) = ψ(R−1 (x − a))

Recall from chapter 19 that this is not an irreducible representation of
E(3), but an irreducible representation can be constructed by taking the
space of solutions that are energy eigenfunctions with ﬁxed eigenvalue
2
E = |p|
2m .
• E(3) will act on distributional ﬁelds Ψ(x) by
Ψ(x) → (a, R) · Ψ(x) = Ψ(Rx + a)

(38.8)

This is because elements of H1 can be written in terms of these distributional ﬁelds as

Ψ(x)ψ(x)d3 x
Ψ(ψ) =
R3

and E(3) will act on Ψ(ψ) by

Ψ(ψ) → (a, R) · Ψ(ψ) =

Ψ(x)ψ(R−1 (x − a))d3 x
Ψ(Rx + a)ψ(x)d3 x

(using invariance of the integration measure under E(3) transformations).
More generally, if elements of H1 are multicomponent functions ψj (for
instance, in the case of spin 12 wavefunctions), the (double cover of) the

38.3

on distributional ﬁelds (see section 38.3.3).
• The action of E(3) on H1 is a linear map preserving the symplectic
structure. We thus expect by the general method of section 20.2 to
be able to construct intertwining operators, by taking the quadratic
functions given by the moment map, quantizing to get a Lie algebra
representation, and exponentiating to get a unitary representation of
E(3). More speciﬁcally, we will use Bargmann–Fock quantization, and
the method carried out for a ﬁnite dimensional phase space in section
25.3. We end up with a representation of E(3) on the quantum ﬁeld
theory state space H, given by unitary operators U (a, R).
It is the last of these that we want to examine here, and as usual for
quantum ﬁeld theory, we do not want to try and explicitly construct the
multiparticle state space H and see the E(3) action on that construction,
but instead want to use the analog of the Heisenberg picture in the timetranslation case, taking the group to act on operators. For each (a, R) ∈ E(3),
we want to ﬁnd operators U (a, R) that will be built out of the ﬁeld operators
and act on the ﬁeld operators as

38.3.3 Spin 12 fields
For the case of two-component wavefunctions describing spin 12 particles satisfying the Pauli–Schrödinger equation (see chapter 34 and section 37.5), the
groups U (1), U (n) (for multiple kinds of spin 12 particles), and the R3 of
translations act independently on the two spinor components, and the for are just the sum of two copies of the single component
 , X,
 and P

equations. As discussed in section 34.2, the action of the rotation group on
solutions in this case requires the use of the double cover SU (2) of SO(3),
with SU (2) group elements Ω acting on two-component solutions ψ by
ψ(x) → Ωψ(R−1 x)
(here R is the SO(3) rotation corresponding to Ω). This action can be thought
of as an action on a tensor product of C2 and a space of functions on R3 ,
with the matrix Ω acting on the C2 factor, and the action on functions the
induced action from rotations on R3 . On distributional ﬁelds, the action will
be by the inverse
Ψ(x) → Ω−1 Ψ(Rx)
(where Ψ has two components).
The SU (2) action on quantum ﬁelds will be given by a unitary operator
U (Ω) satisfying

the non-relativistic case, but we mention it here because its analog in the
relativistic case will be more signiﬁcant.

38.4 Fermionic fields
It is an experimentally observed fact that elementary particles with spin 12
behave as fermions and are described by fermionic ﬁelds. In non-relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theory, such spin 12 elementary particles could in principle be
bosons, described by bosonic ﬁelds as in section 38.3.3. There is, however,
a “spin-statistics theorem” in relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory that says
that spin 12 ﬁelds must be quantized with anticommutators. This provides
an explanation of the observed correlation of values of the spin and of the
particle statistics, due to the fact that the non-relativistic theories describing
fundamental particles should be low-energy limits of relativistic theories.
The discussion of the symplectic and unitary group actions on H1 of section
38.1 has a straightforward analog in the case of a single-particle state space
H1 with Hermitian inner product describing fermions, rather than bosons.
The analog of the inﬁnite dimensional symplectic group action (preserving
the imaginary part of the Hermitian inner product) of the bosonic case is an

490

38 Symmetries and Non-relativistic Quantum Fields

inﬁnite dimensional orthogonal group action (preserving the real part of the
Hermitian inner product) in the fermionic case. The multiparticle state space
will be an inﬁnite dimensional version of the spinor representation for this
orthogonal group. As in the bosonic case, there will be an inﬁnite dimensional
unitary group preserving the full Hermitian inner product, and the groups of
symmetries we will be interested in will be subgroups of this group.
In section 31.3, we saw in ﬁnite dimensions how unitary group actions on a
fermionic phase space gave a unitary representation on the fermionic oscillator
state space, by the same method of annihilation and creation operators as in
the bosonic case (changing commutators to anticommutators). Applying this
to the inﬁnite dimensional case of the single-particle space H1 of solutions to
the free particle Schrödinger equation is done by taking
θj → Ψ(x) or A(p)
θj → Ψ(x) or A(p)
{θj , θk }+ = δjk → {Ψ(x), Ψ(x )}+ = δ(x − x ) or {A(p), A(p )}+ = δ(p − p )

Quadratic combinations of the θj , θj give the Lie algebra of orthogonal
transformations of the phase space M . We will again be interested in the
generalization to M = H1 , but for very speciﬁc quadratic combinations,
corresponding to certain ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras of unitary transformations of H1 . Quantization will take these to quadratic combinations of
fermionic ﬁeld operators, giving a Lie algebra representation on the fermi (equation 38.3),
onic state space. We get the same formulas for operators N


 (equation

X (equation 38.5), P (equation 38.11), L (equation 38.12), and S

R3 translations and SO(3) rotations, respectively. For the free particle, these
operators commute with the Hamiltonian and act as symmetries on the state
space.

38.5 For further reading
The material of this chapter is often developed in conventional quantum ﬁeld
theory texts in the context of relativistic rather than non-relativistic quantum
ﬁeld theory. Symmetry generators are also more often derived via Lagrangian
methods (Noether’s theorem) rather than the Hamiltonian methods used
here. For an example of a detailed physics textbook discussion relatively
close to this one, getting quadratic operators based on group actions on the
space of solutions to ﬁeld equations, see [35].

Chapter 39

Quantization of Infinite dimensional
Phase Spaces

While ﬁnite dimensional Lie groups and their representations are rather
well-understood mathematical objects, this is not at all true for inﬁnite
dimensional Lie groups, where only a fragmentary such understanding is
available. In earlier chapters, we have studied in detail what happens when
quantizing a ﬁnite dimensional phase space, bosonic or fermionic. In these
cases, a ﬁnite dimensional symplectic or orthogonal group acts and quantization uses a representation of these groups. For the case of quantum ﬁeld theories with their inﬁnite dimensional phase spaces, the symplectic or orthogonal
groups acting on these spaces will be inﬁnite dimensional. In this chapter,
we will consider some of the new phenomena that arise when one looks for
inﬁnite dimensional analogs of the role these groups and their representations
play in quantum theory in the ﬁnite dimensional case.
The most important diﬀerence in the inﬁnite dimensional case is that the
Stone–von Neumann theorem and its analog for Cliﬀord algebras no longer
hold. One no longer has a unique (up to unitary equivalence) representation
of the canonical commutation (or anticommutation) relations. It turns out
that only for a restricted sort of inﬁnite dimensional symplectic or orthogonal group does one recover the Stone–von Neumann uniqueness of the ﬁnite
dimensional case, and even then new phenomena appear. The arbitrary constants found in the deﬁnition of the moment map now cannot be ignored
but may appear in commutation relations, leading to something called an
“anomaly.”
Physically, new phenomena due to an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom can have their origin in the degrees of freedom occurring at arbitrarily
short distances (“ultraviolet divergences”), but also can be due to degrees of
freedom corresponding to large distances. In the application of quantum ﬁeld
theories to the study of condensed matter systems, it is the second of these
that is relevant, since the atomic scale provides a cutoﬀ distance scale below
which there are no degrees of freedom.

39 Quantization of Infinite dimensional Phase Spaces

For general interacting quantum ﬁeld theories, one must choose among
inequivalent possibilities for representations of the canonical commutation
relations, ﬁnding one on which the operators of the interacting ﬁeld theory
are well deﬁned. This makes interacting quantum ﬁeld theory a much more
complex subject than free ﬁeld theory and is the source of well-known diﬃculties with inﬁnities that appear when standard calculational methods are
applied. A proper deﬁnition of an interacting quantum ﬁeld theory generally
requires introducing cutoﬀs that make the number of degrees of freedom ﬁnite
so that standard properties used in the ﬁnite dimensional case still hold, then
studying what happens as the cutoﬀs are removed, trying to ﬁnd a physically
sensible limit (“renormalization”).
The reader is warned that this chapter is of a much sketchier nature than
earlier ones, intended only to indicate some outlines of how certain foundational ideas about representation theory and quantization developed for the
ﬁnite dimensional case apply to quantum ﬁeld theory. This material will not
play a signiﬁcant role in later chapters.

39.1 Inequivalent irreducible
representations
In our discussion of quantization, an important part of this story was the
Stone–von Neumann theorem, which says that the Heisenberg group has
only one interesting irreducible representation, up to unitary equivalence (the
Schrödinger representation). In inﬁnite dimensions, this is no longer true:
there will be an inﬁnite number of inequivalent irreducible representations,
with no known complete classiﬁcation of the possibilities. Before one can even
begin to compute things like expectation values of observables, one needs to
ﬁnd an appropriate choice of representation, adding a new layer of diﬃculty
to the problem that goes beyond that of just increasing the number of degrees
of freedom.
To get some idea of how the Stone–von Neumann theorem can fail, one can
consider the Bargmann–Fock quantization of the harmonic oscillator degrees
of freedom and the coherent states (see section 23.2)
†

|α = D(α)|0 = eαa −αa |0
where D(α) is a unitary operator. These satisfy
|α|0|2 = e−|α|

2

Each choice of α gives a diﬀerent, unitarily equivalent using D(α), representation of the Heisenberg group. This is on the space spanned by

39.1

Inequivalent irreducible representations

495

D(α)(a† )n |0 = (a(α)† )n |α
where

a(α)† = D(α)a† D−1 (α)

This is for d = 1, for arbitrary d one gets states parametrized by a vector
α ∈ Cd , and
d
2
|α|0|2 = e− j=1 |αj |
In
dimensional case, for any sequence of αj with divergent
∞the inﬁnite
2
j=1 |αj | , one will have
α|0 = 0
For each such sequence α, this leads to a diﬀerent representation of the
Heisenberg group, spanned by acting with various products of the
aj (α)† = D(α)a†j D−1 (α)
on |α.
These representations will all be unitarily inequivalent. To show that the
representation built on |α is inequivalent to the one built on |0, one shows
that |α is not only orthogonal to |0 but to all the other (a†j )n |0 also. This
is true because one has (see equation 23.8)
aj (α) = D(α)aj D−1 (α) = aj − αj
so
(aj (α) + αj )|α
0|anj |α =0|an−1
j
=αj 0|an−1
|α = . . .
j
=αjn 0|α = 0
Examples of this kind of phenomenon can occur in quantum ﬁeld theories,
in cases where it is energetically favorable for many quanta of the ﬁeld to
“condense” into the lowest energy state. This could be a state like |α, with
d


α|a†j aj |α

j=1

having a physical interpretation in terms of a nonzero particle density in the
condensate state |α.
Other examples of this phenomenon can be constructed by considering
changes in the complex structure J used to deﬁne the Bargmann–Fock

496

39 Quantization of Infinite dimensional Phase Spaces

construction of the representation. For ﬁnite d, representations deﬁned using
|0J for diﬀerent complex structures are all unitarily equivalent, but this can
fail in the limit as d goes to inﬁnity.
In both the standard oscillator case with Sp(2d, R) acting, and the
fermionic oscillator case with SO(2d, R) acting, we found that there were
“Bogoliubov transformations”: elements of the group not in the U (d) subgroup distinguished by the choice of J, which acted non-trivially on |0J ,
taking it to a diﬀerent state. As in the case of the Heisenberg group action
on coherent states above, such action by Bogoliubov transformations can, in
the limit of d → ∞, take |0 to an orthogonal state. This introduces the possibility of inequivalent representations of the commutation relations, built by
applying operators to orthogonal ground states. The physical interpretation
again is that such states correspond to condensates of quanta. For the usual
bosonic oscillator case, this phenomenon occurs in the theory of superﬂuidity,
for fermionic oscillators it occurs in the theory of superconductivity. It was
in the study of such systems that Bogoliubov discovered the transformations
that now bear his name.

39.2 The restricted symplectic group
If one restricts the class of complex structures J to ones not that diﬀerent from the standard one J0 , then one can recover a version of the Stone–
von Neumann theorem and have much the same behavior as in the ﬁnite
dimensional case. Note that for each invertible linear map g on phase space,
g acts on the complex structure (see equation 26.6), taking J0 to a complex
structure we will call Jg . One can deﬁne subgroups of the inﬁnite dimensional
symplectic or orthogonal groups as follows:
Definition (Restricted symplectic and orthogonal groups). The group of linear transformations g of an inﬁnite dimensional symplectic vector space preserving the symplectic structure and also satisfying the condition
tr(A† A) < ∞
on the operator
A = [Jg , J0 ]
is called the restricted symplectic group and denoted Spres . The group of linear
transformations g of an inﬁnite dimensional inner product space preserving
the inner product and satisfying the same condition as above on [Jg , J0 ] is
called the restricted orthogonal group and denoted SOres .
An operator A satisfying tr(A† A) < ∞ is said to be a Hilbert–Schmidt
operator.

39.2

The restricted symplectic group

497

One then has the following replacement for the Stone–von Neumann
theorem:
Theorem. Given two complex structures J1 , J2 on a Hilbert space such that
[J1 , J2 ] is Hilbert–Schmidt, acting on the states
|0J1 , |0J2
by annihilation and creation operators will give unitarily equivalent representations of the Weyl algebra (in the bosonic case) or the Cliﬀord algebra (in
the fermionic case).
The standard reference for the proof of this statement is the original papers
of Shale [79] and Shale–Stinespring [80]. A detailed discussion of the theorem
can be found in [64].
For some motivation for this theorem, consider the ﬁnite dimensional case
studied in section 25.5 (this is for the symplectic group case, a similar calculation holds in the orthogonal group case). Elements of sp(2d, R) corresponding
to Bogoliubov transformations (i.e., with nonzero commutator with J0 ) were
of the form
1
(Bjk zj zk + B jk z j z k )
2
jk

for symmetric complex matrices B. These acted on the metaplectic representation by
i
−
(Bjk a†j a†k + B jk aj ak )
(39.1)
2
jk

and commuting two of them gave a result (equation 25.9) corresponding to
quantization of an element of the u(d) subgroup, diﬀering from its normalordered version by a term
1
1
− tr(BC − CB)1 = − tr(BC † − CB † )1
2
2
For d = ∞, this trace, in general, will be inﬁnite and undeﬁned. An
alternate characterization of Hilbert–Schmidt operators is that for B and
C Hilbert–Schmidt operators, the traces
tr(BC † ) and tr(CB † )
will be ﬁnite and well deﬁned. So, at least to the extent normal-ordered
operators quadratic in annihilation and creation operators are well deﬁned,
the Hilbert–Schmidt condition on operators not commuting with the complex
structure implies that they will have well-deﬁned commutation relations with
each other.

39 Quantization of Infinite dimensional Phase Spaces

39.3 The anomaly and the Schwinger term
The argument above gives some motivation for the existence as d goes to
∞ of well-deﬁned commutators of operators of the form 39.1 and thus for
the existence of an analog of the metaplectic representation for the inﬁnite
dimensional Lie algebra spres of Spres . There is one obvious problem though
with this argument, in that while it tells us that normal-ordered operators
will have well-deﬁned commutation relations, they are not quite the right
commutation relations, due to the occurrence of the extra scalar term
1
− tr(BC † − CB † )1
2
This term is sometimes called the “Schwinger term.”
The Schwinger term causes a problem with the standard expectation that
given some group G acting on the phase space preserving the Poisson bracket,
one should get a unitary representation of G on the quantum state space H.
This problem is sometimes called the “anomaly,” meaning that the expected
unitary Lie algebra representation does not exist (due to extra scalar terms
in the commutation relations). Recall from section 15.3 that this potential
problem was already visible at the classical level, in the fact that given L ∈ g,
the corresponding moment map μL is only well deﬁned up to a constant.
While for the ﬁnite dimensional cases we studied, the constants could be
chosen so as to make the map
L → μL
a Lie algebra homomorphism, that turns out to no longer be true for the
case g = spres (or sores ) acting on an inﬁnite dimensional phase space. The
potential problem of the anomaly is thus already visible classically, but it is
only when one constructs the quantum theory, and thus a representation on
the state space that one can see whether the problem cannot be removed by
a constant shift in the representation operators. This situation, despite its
classical origin, is sometimes characterized as a form of symmetry breaking
due to the quantization procedure.
Note that this problem will not occur for G that commute with the complex structure, since for these the normal-ordered Lie algebra representation operators will be a true representation of u(∞) ⊂ spres . We will call
U (∞) ⊂ Spres the subgroup of elements that commute with J0 exactly, not
just up to a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. It turns out that G ⊂ U (∞) for most
of the cases we are interested in, allowing construction of the Lie algebra
representation by normal-ordered quadratic combinations of the annihilation
and creation operators (as in 25.6). Also note that since normal-ordering just
shifts operators by something proportional to a constant, when this constant
is ﬁnite there will be no anomaly since one can get operators with correct

39.3

The anomaly and the Schwinger term

499

commutators by such a ﬁnite shift of the normal-ordered ones. The anomaly
is an inherently inﬁnite dimensional problem since it is only then that inﬁnite shifts are necessary. When the anomaly does appear, it will appear as a
phase ambiguity in the group representation operators (not just a sign ambiguity as in ﬁnite dimensional case of Sp(2d, R)), and H will be a projective
representation of the group (a representation up to phase).
Such an undetermined phase factor only creates a problem for the action
on states, not for the action on operators. Recall that in the ﬁnite dimensional
case, the action of Sp(2d, R) on operators (see 20.3) is independent of any
constant shift in the Lie algebra representation operators. Equivalently, if
one has a unitary projective representation on states, the phase ambiguity
cancels out in the action on operators, which is by conjugation.

39.4 Spontaneous symmetry breaking
In the standard Bargmann–Fock construction, there is a unique state |0, and
for the Hamiltonian of the free particle quantum ﬁeld theory, this will be the
lowest energy state. In interacting quantum ﬁeld theories, one may have state
spaces unitarily inequivalent to the standard Bargmann–Fock one. These can
have their own annihilation and creation operators, and thus a notion of
 , but the lowest energy |0
particle number and a particle number operator N
may not have the properties
 |0 = 0, e−iθN |0 = |0
N


Instead, the state |0 gets taken by e−iθN to some other state, with
 |0 = 0, e−iθN |0 ≡ |θ = |0 (for θ = 0)
N
 , so it does not have a well-deﬁned
and the vacuum state not an eigenstate of N
 , H]
 = 0, the states |θ will all have the same energy as
particle number. If [N
|0 and there will be a multiplicity of diﬀerent vacuum states, labeled by θ.
In such a case, the U (1) symmetry is said to be “spontaneously broken.”
This phenomenon occurs when non-relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory is used
to describe a superconductor. There the lowest energy state will be a state
without a deﬁnite particle number, with electrons pairing up in a way that
allows them to lower their energy, “condensing” in the lowest energy state.
When, as for the multicomponent free particle (the Hamiltonian of equation 38.4), the Hamiltonian is invariant under U (n) transformations of the
ﬁelds ψj , then we will have
 H]
 =0
[X,

500

39 Quantization of Infinite dimensional Phase Spaces

 the operator giving the Lie algebra representation of U (n) on the mulfor X
tiparticle state space (see section 38.2.2). In this case, if |0 is invariant under
the U (n) symmetry, then energy eigenstates of the quantum ﬁeld theory will
break up into irreducible representations of U (n) and can be labeled accordingly. As in the U (1) case, the U (n) symmetry may be spontaneously broken,
with

X|0
= 0
for some directions X in u(n). When this happens, just as in the U (1) case
states did not have well-deﬁned particle number, now they will not carry
well-deﬁned irreducible U (n) representation labels.

39.5 Higher-order operators and
renormalization
We have generally restricted ourselves to considering only products of basis
elements of the Heisenberg Lie algebra (position and momentum in the ﬁnite
dimensional case, ﬁelds in the inﬁnite dimensional case) of degree less than or
equal to two, since it is these that after quantization have an interpretation
as the operators of a Lie algebra representation. In the ﬁnite dimensional
case, one can consider higher-order products of operators, for instance systems with Hamiltonian operators of higher order than quadratic. Unlike the
quadratic case, typically no exact solution for eigenvectors and eigenvalues
will exist, but various approximation methods may be available. In particular, for Hamiltonians that are quadratic plus a term with a small parameter,
perturbation theory methods can be used to compute a power series approximation in the small parameter. This is an important topic in physics, covered
in detail in the standard textbooks.
The standard approach to quantization of inﬁnite dimensional systems is
to begin with “regularization,” somehow modifying the system to only have
a ﬁnite dimensional phase space, for instance by introducing cutoﬀs that
make the possible momenta discrete and ﬁnite. One quantizes this theory by
taking the state space and canonical commutation relations to be the unique
ones for the Heisenberg Lie algebra, somehow dealing with the calculational
diﬃculties in the interacting case (non-quadratic Hamiltonian).
One then tries to take a limit that recovers the inﬁnite dimensional system. Such a limit will generally be quite singular, leading to an inﬁnite result,
and the process of manipulating these potential inﬁnities is called “renormalization.” Techniques for taking limits of this kind in a manner that leads to
a consistent and physically sensible result typically take up a large part of
standard quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks. For many theories, no appropriate
such techniques are known, and conjecturally none are possible. For others

39.5

Higher-order operators and renormalization

501

there is good evidence that such a limit can be successfully taken, but the
details of how to do this remain unknown, with for instance a $1 million
Millenium Prize oﬀered for showing rigorously this is possible in the case of
Yang–Mills gauge theory (the Hamiltonian, in this case, will be discussed in
chapter 46).

39.6 For further reading
Berezin’s The Method of Second Quantization [6] develops in detail the inﬁnite dimensional version of the Bargmann–Fock construction, both in the
bosonic and fermionic cases. Inﬁnite dimensional versions of the metaplectic and spinor representations are given there in terms of operators deﬁned
by integral kernels. For a discussion of the inﬁnite dimensional Weyl and
Cliﬀord algebras, together with a realization of their automorphism groups
Spres and Ores (and the corresponding Lie algebras) in terms of annihilation
and creation operators acting on the inﬁnite dimensional metaplectic and
spinor representations, see [64]. The book [70] contains an extensive discussion of the groups Spres and Ores and the inﬁnite dimensional version of their
metaplectic and spinor representations. It emphasizes the origin of novel inﬁnite dimensional phenomena in the geometry of the complex structures used
in inﬁnite dimensional examples.
The use of Bogoliubov transformations in the theories of superﬂuidity and
superconductivity is a standard topic in quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks that
emphasize condensed matter applications, see, for example, [53]. The book
[11] discusses in detail the occurrence of inequivalent representations of the
commutation relations in various physical systems.
For a discussion of “Haag’s theorem,” which can be interpreted as showing
that to describe an interacting quantum ﬁeld theory, one must use a representation of the canonical commutation relations inequivalent to the one for
free ﬁeld theory, see [19].

Chapter 40

Minkowski Space and the Lorentz
Group

For the case of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we saw that systems with
an arbitrary number of particles, bosons or fermions, could be described by
taking as dual phase space the state space H1 of the single-particle quantum
theory. This space is inﬁnite dimensional, but it is linear and it can be quantized using the same techniques that work for the ﬁnite dimensional harmonic
oscillator. This is an example of a quantum ﬁeld theory since it is a space of
functions that is being quantized.
We would like to ﬁnd some similar way to proceed for the case of relativistic systems, ﬁnding relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories capable of describing arbitrary numbers of particles, with the energy–momentum relationship
E 2 = |p|2 c2 + m2 c4 characteristic of special relativity, not the non-relativistic
2
limit |p|  mc where E = |p|
2m . In general, a phase space can be thought of
as the space of initial conditions for an equation of motion, or equivalently, as
the space of solutions of the equation of motion. In the non-relativistic ﬁeld
theory, the equation of motion is the ﬁrst order in time Schrödinger equation,
and the phase space is the space of ﬁelds (wavefunctions) at a speciﬁed initial
time, say t = 0. This space carries a representation of the time-translation
group R and the Euclidean group E(3) = R3  SO(3). To construct a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, we want to ﬁnd an analog of this space of
wavefunctions. It will be some sort of linear space of functions satisfying an
equation of motion, and we will then quantize by applying harmonic oscillator
methods.
Just as in the non-relativistic case, the space of solutions to the equation
of motion provides a representation of the group of space–time symmetries
of the theory. This group will now be the Poincaré group, a ten-dimensional
group which includes a four-dimensional subgroup of translations in space–
time, and a six-dimensional subgroup (the Lorentz group), which combines
spatial rotations and “boosts” (transformations mixing spatial and time coorc Peter Woit 2017

dinates). The representation of the Poincaré group on the solutions to the
relativistic wave equation will in general be reducible. Irreducible such representations will be the objects corresponding to elementary particles. This
chapter will deal with the Lorentz group itself, chapter 41 with its representations, and chapter 42 will move on to the Poincaré group and its representations.

40.1 Minkowski space
Special relativity is based on the principle that one should consider space
and time together, and take them to be a four-dimensional space R4 with an
indeﬁnite inner product:
Definition (Minkowski space). Minkowski space M 4 is the vector space R4
with an indeﬁnite inner product given by
(x, y) ≡ x · y = −x0 y0 + x1 y1 + x2 y2 + x3 y3
where (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) are the coordinates of x ∈ R4 , (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 ) the coordinates of y ∈ R4 .
Digression. We have chosen to use the − + ++ instead of the + − −− sign
convention for the following reasons:
• Analytically continuing the time variable x0 to ix0 gives a positivedeﬁnite inner product.
• Restricting to spatial components, there is no change from our previous
formulas for the symmetries of Euclidean space E(3).
• Only for this choice will we have a real (as opposed to complex) spinor
representation (since Cliﬀ(3, 1) = M (4, R) = Cliﬀ(1, 3)).
• Weinberg’s quantum ﬁeld theory textbook [99] uses this convention
(although, unlike him, we will put the 0 component ﬁrst).
This inner product will also sometimes be written using the matrix

Digression (Upper and lower indices). In many physics texts, it is conventional in discussions of special relativity to write formulas using both upper
and lower indices, related by
xμ =

3


ημν xν = ημν xν

ν=0

with the last form of this using the Einstein summation convention.
One motivation for introducing both upper and lower indices is that special
relativity is a limiting case of general relativity, which is a fully geometrical
theory based on taking space–time to be a manifold M with a metric g that
varies from point to point. In such a theory, it is important to distinguish
between elements of the tangent space Tx (M ) at a point x ∈ M and elements
of its dual, the cotangent space Tx∗ (M ), while using the fact that the metric
g provides an inner product on Tx (M ) and thus an isomorphism Tx (M ) 
Tx∗ (M ). In the special relativity case, this distinction between Tx (M ) and
Tx∗ (M ) just comes down to an issue of signs, but the upper and lower index
notation is useful for keeping track of those.
A second motivation is that position and momenta naturally live in dual
vector spaces, so one would like to distinguish between the vector space M 4
of positions and the dual vector space of momenta. In the case though of a
vector space like M 4 which comes with a ﬁxed inner product ημν , this inner
product gives a ﬁxed identiﬁcation of M 4 and its dual, an identiﬁcation that
is also an identiﬁcation as representations of the Lorentz group. Given this
ﬁxed identiﬁcation, we will not here try and distinguish by notation whether
a vector is in M 4 or its dual, so will just use lower indices, not both upper
and lower indices.
The coordinates x1 , x2 , x3 are interpreted as spatial coordinates, and the
coordinate x0 is a time coordinate, related to the conventional time coordinate
t with respect to chosen units of time and distance by x0 = ct where c is the
speed of light. Mostly we will assume units of time and distance have been
chosen so that c = 1.
Vectors v ∈ M 4 such that |v|2 = v·v > 0 are called “space-like,” those with
|v|2 < 0 “time-like” and those with |v|2 = 0 are said to lie on the “light cone.”
Suppressing one space dimension, the picture to keep in mind of Minkowski
space looks like this:

40.2 The Lorentz group and its Lie algebra
Recall that in 3 dimensions the group of linear transformations of R3 preserving the standard inner product was the group O(3) of 3 by 3 orthogonal matrices. This group has two disconnected components: SO(3), the subgroup of
orientation preserving (determinant +1) transformations, and a component of
orientation reversing (determinant −1) transformations. In Minkowski space,
one has:
Definition (Lorentz group). The Lorentz group O(3, 1) is the group of linear
transformations preserving the Minkowski space inner product on R4 .
In terms of matrices, the condition for a 4 by 4 matrix Λ to be in O(3, 1)
will be

The Lorentz group and its Lie algebra

The Lorentz group has four components, with the component of the identity a subgroup called SO(3, 1) (which some call SO+ (3, 1)). The other three
components arise by multiplication of elements in SO(3, 1) by P, T, P T where

on the spatial components, given by matrices of the form

where R is in SO(3). For each pair j, k of spatial directions one has the
usual SO(2) subgroup of rotations in the jk plane, but now in addition for
each pair 0, j of the time direction with a spatial direction, one has SO(1, 1)
subgroups of matrices of transformations called “boosts” in the j direction.
For example, for j = 1, one has the subgroup of SO(3, 1) of matrices of the
form

can take six matrices Mμν for μ, ν ∈ 0, 1, 2, 3 and j < k. For the spatial

and recall that these satisfy the so(3) commutation relations
[l1 , l2 ] = l3 , [l2 , l3 ] = l1 , [l3 , l1 ] = l2
and correspond to inﬁnitesimal rotations about the three spatial axes.

These can be renamed as

One can easily calculate the commutation relations between the kj and lj ,
which show that the kj transform as a vector under inﬁnitesimal rotations.
For instance, for inﬁnitesimal rotations about the x1 axis, one ﬁnds
[l1 , k1 ] = 0, [l1 , k2 ] = k3 , [l1 , k3 ] = −k2

(40.1)

Commuting inﬁnitesimal boosts, one gets inﬁnitesimal spatial rotations
[k1 , k2 ] = −l3 , [k3 , k1 ] = −l2 , [k2 , k3 ] = −l1

(40.2)

Digression. A more conventional notation in physics is to use Jj = ilj for
inﬁnitesimal rotations and Kj = ikj for inﬁnitesimal boosts. The intention
of the diﬀerent notation used here is to start with basis elements of the real
Lie algebra so(3, 1), (the lj and kj ) which are purely real objects, before complexifying and considering representations of the Lie algebra.
Taking the following complex linear combinations of the lj and kj
Aj =

1
1
(lj + ikj ), Bj = (lj − ikj )

one ﬁnds
[A1 , A2 ] = A3 , [A3 , A1 ] = A2 , [A2 , A3 ] = A1

The Lorentz group and its Lie algebra

and
[B1 , B2 ] = B3 , [B3 , B1 ] = B2 , [B2 , B3 ] = B1
This construction of the Aj , Bj requires that we complexify (allow complex
linear combinations of basis elements) the Lie algebra so(3, 1) of SO(3, 1)
and work with the complex Lie algebra so(3, 1) ⊗ C. It shows that this Lie
algebra splits into a sum of two sub-Lie algebras, which are each copies of
the (complexiﬁed) Lie algebra of SO(3), so(3) ⊗ C. Since
so(3) ⊗ C = su(2) ⊗ C = sl(2, C)
we have
so(3, 1) ⊗ C = sl(2, C) ⊕ sl(2, C)
In section 40.4, we will see the origin of this phenomenon at the group level.

40.3 The Fourier transform in Minkowski
space
One can deﬁne a Fourier transform with respect to the four space–time variables, which will take functions of x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 to functions of the Fourier
transform variables p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 :
Definition (Minkowski space Fourier transform). The Fourier transform of
a function f on Minkowski space is given by
1
(2π)2

=
(2π)2

e−ip·x f (x)d4 x

f (p) =

M4

M4

e−i(−p0 x0 +p1 x1 +p2 x2 +p3 x3 ) f (x)dx0 d3 x

In this case, the Fourier inversion formula is
f (x) =

1
(2π)2

eip·x f (p)d4 p

(40.3)

M4

Note that our deﬁnition puts one factor of √12π with each Fourier (or inverse
Fourier) transform with respect to a single variable. A common alternate
convention among physicists is to put all factors of 2π with the p integrals
(and thus in the inverse Fourier transform), none in the deﬁnition of f (p),
the Fourier transform itself.

510

40 Minkowski Space and the Lorentz Group

The sign change between the time and space variables that occurs in the
exponent of this deﬁnition is there to ensure that this exponent is Lorentz
invariant. Since Lorentz transformations have determinant 1, the measure
d4 x will be Lorentz invariant and the Fourier transform of a function will
behave under Lorentz transformations in the same ways as the function

The reason why one conventionally deﬁnes the Hamiltonian operator as i ∂t
∂
(with eigenvalues p0 = E) but the momentum operator Pj as −i ∂x
(with
j
eigenvalues pj ) is due to this Lorentz invariant choice of the Fourier transform.

40.4 Spin and the Lorentz group
Just as the groups SO(n) have double covers Spin(n), the group SO(3, 1)
has a double cover Spin(3, 1), which we will show can be identiﬁed with the
group SL(2, C) of 2 by 2 complex matrices with unit determinant. This group
will have the same Lie algebra as SO(3, 1), and we will sometimes refer to
either group as the “Lorentz group.”
Recall from chapter 6 that for SO(3), the spin double cover Spin(3) can
be identiﬁed with either Sp(1) (the unit quaternions) or SU (2), and then
the action of Spin(3) as SO(3) rotations of R3 was given by conjugation
of imaginary quaternions (using Sp(1)) or certain 2 by 2 complex matrices
(using SU (2)). In the SU (2) case, this was done explicitly by identifying
(x1 , x2 , x3 ) ↔

x3
x1 + ix2

x1 − ix2
− x3

and then showing that conjugating this matrix by an element of SU (2) was
a linear map leaving invariant
det

x3
x1 + ix2

x1 − ix2
− x3

= −(x21 + x22 + x23 )

and thus a rotation in SO(3).
The same sort of thing works for the Lorentz group case. Now we identify
R4 with the space of 2 by 2 complex self-adjoint matrices by

40.4

Spin and the Lorentz group

511

(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) ↔

x0 + x3
x1 + ix2

x1 − ix2
x0 − x3

and observe that
det

x1 − ix2
x0 − x3

x0 + x3
x1 + ix2

= x20 − x21 − x22 − x23

This provides a very useful way to think of Minkowski space: as complex
self-adjoint 2 by 2 matrices, with norm-squared minus the determinant of the
matrix.

We have found an extension of this map to a double covering map from
SL(2, C) to SO(3, 1). This restricts to Φ on the subgroup SU (2) of SL(2, C)
matrices satisfying Ω† = Ω−1 .
Digression (The complex group Spin(4, C) and its real forms). Recall from
chapter 6 that we found that Spin(4) = Sp(1)×Sp(1), with the corresponding
SO(4) transformation given by identifying R4 with the quaternions H and
taking not just conjugations by unit quaternions, but both left and right multiplication by distinct unit quaternions. Rewriting this in terms of complex
matrices instead of quaternions, we have Spin(4) = SU (2) × SU (2), and a
pair Ω1 , Ω2 of SU (2) matrices acts as an SO(4) rotation by

preserving the determinant x20 + x21 + x22 + x23 .
For another example, consider the identiﬁcation of R4 with 2 by 2 real
matrices given by
(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) ↔

x0 + x3
x2 − x1

x2 + x1
x0 − x3

preserves the reality condition on the matrix, and preserves
det

x0 + x3
x2 − x1

x2 + x1

= x20 + x21 − x22 − x23

so gives an element of SO(2, 2), and we see that Spin(2, 2) = SL(2, R) ×
SL(2, R).
These three diﬀerent constructions for the cases
Spin(4) = SU (2) × SU (2), Spin(3, 1) = SL(2, C)
and
Spin(2, 2) = SL(2, R) × SL(2, R)
correspond to diﬀerent so-called “real forms” of a fact about complex groups
that one can get by complexifying any of the examples (considering elements
(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ C4 , not just in R4 ). For instance, in the Spin(4) case,
taking the x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 in the matrix

preserves this space as well as the determinant (z02 + z12 + z22 + z32 ) for Ω1 and
Ω2 not just in SU (2), but in the larger group SL(2, C). So we ﬁnd that the
group SO(4, C) of complex orthogonal transformations of C4 has spin double
cover
Spin(4, C) = SL(2, C) × SL(2, C)
Since spin(4, C) = so(3, 1) ⊗ C, this relation between complex Lie groups
corresponds to the Lie algebra relation
so(3, 1) ⊗ C = sl(2, C) ⊕ sl(2, C)
we found explicitly earlier when we showed that by taking complex coeﬃcients
of generators lj and kj of so(3, 1) we could ﬁnd generators Aj and Bj of two
diﬀerent sl(2, C) subalgebras.

40.5 For further reading
Those not familiar with special relativity should consult a textbook on the
subject for the physics background necessary to appreciate the signiﬁcance
of Minkowski space and its Lorentz group of invariances. An example of a
suitable such book aimed at mathematics students is Woodhouse’s Special
Relativity [104].
Most quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks have some sort of discussion of the
Lorentz group and its Lie algebra, although the issue of how complexiﬁcation works in this case is routinely ignored (recall the comments in section
5.5). Typical examples are Peskin–Schroeder [67], see the beginning of their
chapter 3 or chapter II.3 [105] of Zee.

Chapter 41

Representations of the Lorentz
Group

Having seen the importance in quantum mechanics of understanding the
representations of the rotation group SO(3) and its double cover Spin(3) =
SU (2), one would like to also understand the representations of the Lorentz
group SO(3, 1) and its double cover Spin(3, 1) = SL(2, C). One diﬀerence
from the SO(3) case is that all non-trivial ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations of the Lorentz group are non-unitary (there are inﬁnite dimensional
unitary irreducible representations, of no known physical signiﬁcance, which
we will not discuss). While these ﬁnite dimensional representations themselves only provide a unitary action of the subgroup Spin(3) ⊂ Spin(3, 1),
they will later be used in the construction of quantum ﬁeld theories whose
state spaces will have a unitary action of the Lorentz group.

41.1 Representations of the Lorentz group
In the SU (2) case, we found irreducible unitary representations (πn , V n ) of
dimension n + 1 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. These could also be labeled by s = n2 ,
called the “spin” of the representation, and we will do that from now on.
These representations can be realized explicitly as homogeneous polynomials
of degree n = 2s in two complex variables z1 , z2 . For the case of Spin(4) =
SU (2) × SU (2), the irreducible representations will be tensor products
V s1 ⊗ V s2
of SU (2) irreducibles, with the ﬁrst SU (2) acting on the ﬁrst factor, the
second on the second factor. The case s1 = s2 = 0 is the trivial representation,
s1 = 12 , s2 = 0 is one of the half-spinor representations of Spin(4) on C2 ,

s1 = 0, s2 = 12 is the other, and s1 = s2 = 12 is the representation on fourdimensional (complexiﬁed) vectors.
Turning now to Spin(3, 1) = SL(2, C), one can use the same construction
using homogeneous polynomials as in the SU (2) case to get irreducible representations of dimension 2s + 1 for s = 0, 12 , 1, . . .. Instead of acting by SU (2)
on z1 , z2 , one acts by SL(2, C), and then as before uses the induced action
on polynomials of z1 and z2 . This gives representations (πs , V s ) of SL(2, C).
Among the things that are diﬀerent though about these representations:
• They are not unitary (except in the case of the trivial representation).

that is invariant under the SL(2, C) action on V 2 and can be used
to identify the representation and its dual. This is the complexiﬁcation
of the symplectic form on R2 studied in section 16.1.1, and the same
calculation there which showed that it was SL(2, R) invariant here shows
that the complex version is SL(2, C) invariant.
• In the case of SU (2) representations, the complex conjugate representation one gets by taking as representation matrices π(g) instead of π(g) is
equivalent to the original representation (the same representation, with
a diﬀerent basis choice, so matrices changed by a conjugation). To see
this for the spin 12 representation, note that SU (2) matrices are of the

is the change of basis matrix relating the representation and its complex
conjugate.
This is no longer true for SL(2, C). Conjugation by a ﬁxed matrix will
not change the eigenvalues of the matrix, and these can be complex
(unlike SU (2) matrices, which have real eigenvalues). So such a (matrix)
conjugation cannot change all SL(2, C) matrices to their complex conjugates, since in general (complex) conjugation will change their eigenvalues.
The classiﬁcation of irreducible ﬁnite dimensional SU (2) representation
was done in chapter 8 by considering its Lie algebra su(2), complexiﬁed to give
us raising and lowering operators, and this complexiﬁcation is sl(2, C). If one
examines that argument, one ﬁnds that it mostly also applies to irreducible
ﬁnite dimensional sl(2, C) representations. There is a diﬀerence though: now,
ﬂipping positive to negative weights (which corresponds to change of sign of
the Lie algebra representation matrices or conjugation of the Lie group representation matrices) no longer takes one to an equivalent representation. It
turns out that to get all irreducibles, one must take both the representations
we already know about and their complex conjugates. One can show (we
will not prove this here) that the tensor product of one of each type of irreducible is still an irreducible, and that the complete list of ﬁnite dimensional
irreducible representations of sl(2, C) is given by:
Theorem (Classiﬁcation of ﬁnite dimensional sl(2, C) representations). The
irreducible representations of sl(2, C) are labeled by (s1 , s2 ) for sj =0, 12 , 1, . . ..
These representations are given by the tensor product representations
(πs1 ⊗ π s2 , V s1 ⊗ V s2 )
where (πs , V s ) is the irreducible representation of dimension 2s + 1 and
(π s , V s ) its complex conjugate. Such representations have dimension
(2s1 + 1)(2s2 + 1).
All these representations are also representations of the group SL(2, C),
and one has the same classiﬁcation theorem for the group, although we will
not try and prove this. We will also not try and study these representations

518

in general but will restrict attention to the cases of most physical interest,
which are
• (0, 0): The trivial representation on C, also called the “spin 0” or scalar
representation.
• ( 12 , 0): These are called left-handed (for reasons we will see later on)
“Weyl spinors.” We will often denote the representation space C2 in
this case as SL and write an element of it as ψL .
• (0, 12 ): These are called right-handed Weyl spinors. We will often denote
the representation space C2 in this case as SR and write an element of
it as ψR .
• ( 12 , 12 ): This is called the “vector” representation since it is the complexiﬁcation of the action of SL(2, C) as SO(3, 1) transformations of
space–time vectors that we saw earlier. It is a representation of SO(3, 1)
as well as SL(2, C).
• ( 12 , 0) ⊕ (0, 12 ): This reducible four-complex dimensional representation
is known as the representation on “Dirac spinors.”
One can manipulate these Weyl spinor representations ( 12 , 0) and (0, 12 ) in
a similar way to the treatment of tangent vectors and their duals in tensor
analysis. Just like in that formalism, one can distinguish between a representation space and its dual by upper and lower indices, in this case using
not the metric but the SL(2, C) invariant bilinear form  to raise and lower
indices. With complex conjugates and duals, there are four kinds of irreducible SL(2, C) representations on C2 to keep track of:
• SL : This is the standard deﬁning representation of SL(2, C) on C2 , with
Ω ∈ SL(2, C) acting on ψL ∈ SL by
ψL → ΩψL
A standard index notation for such things is called the “van der Waerden notation.” It uses a lower index A taking values 1, 2 to label the
components with respect to a basis of SL as follows:

ψL =

ψ1
ψ2

and in this notation, Ω acts by

This is a general property of representations: given any ﬁnite dimensional representation (π(g), V ), the pairing between V and its dual V ∗
is preserved by acting on V ∗ by matrices (π(g)−1 )T , and these provide a
representation ((π(g)−1 )T , V ∗ ). In van der Waerden notation, one uses
upper indices and writes

ψ A → ((Ω−1 )T )A

denote that the vector is in this representation, but we will reserve that

Restricting to the SU (2) subgroup of SL(2, C), all these representations
are unitary and equivalent. As SL(2, C) representations, they are not unitary,
and while the representations are equivalent to their duals, SL and SR are
inequivalent (since as we have seen, one cannot complex conjugate SL(2, C)
matrices by a matrix conjugation).
For the case of the ( 12 , 12 ) representation, to see explicitly the isomorphism
between SL ⊗ SR and vectors, recall that we can identify Minkowski space
with 2 by 2 self-adjoint matrices. Ω ∈ SL(2, C) acts by

41.2 Dirac γ-matrices and Cliﬀ(3, 1)
In our discussion of the fermionic version of the harmonic oscillator, we
deﬁned the Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(r, s) and found that elements quadratic in
its generators gave a basis for the Lie algebra of so(r, s) = spin(r, s). Exponentiating these gave an explicit construction of the group Spin(r, s). We can
apply that general theory to the case of Cliﬀ(3, 1) and this will give us the
representations ( 12 , 0) and (0, 12 ).
If we complexify our R4 , then its Cliﬀord algebra becomes the algebra of
4 by 4 complex matrices
Cliﬀ(3, 1) ⊗ C = Cliﬀ(4, C) = M (4, C)
We will represent elements of Cliﬀ(3, 1) as such 4 by 4 matrices, but should
keep in mind that we are working in the complexiﬁcation of the Clifford algebra that corresponds to the Lorentz group, so there is some sort
of condition on the matrices that needs to be kept track of to identify
Cliﬀ(3, 1) ⊂ M (4, C). There are several diﬀerent choices of how to explicitly represent these matrices, and for diﬀerent purposes, diﬀerent ones are
most convenient. The one we will begin with and mostly use is sometimes
called the chiral or Weyl representation and is the most convenient for discussing massless charged particles. We will try and follow the conventions
used for this representation in [99]. Note that these 4 by 4 matrices act not
on four-dimensional space–time, but on spinors. It is a special feature of 4
dimensions that these two diﬀerent representations of the Lorentz group have
the same dimension.
Writing 4 by 4 matrices in 2 by 2 block form and using the Pauli matrices
σj , we assign the following matrices to Cliﬀord algebra generators

The importance of the Majorana representation is that it shows the interesting possibility of having (in signature (3, 1)) a spinor representation on a
real vector space R4 , since one sees that the Cliﬀord algebra matrices can be
chosen to be real. One has

The Majorana spinor representation is on SM = R4 , with γ0 γ1 γ2 γ3 a real
operator on this space with square −1, so it provides a complex structure on
SM . Recall that a complex structure on a real vector space gives a splitting of
the complexiﬁcation of the real vector space into a sum of two complex vector
spaces, related by complex conjugation. In this case, this corresponds to
∗
S M ⊗ C = SL ⊕ S R

the fact that complexifying Majorana spinors gives the two kinds of Weyl
spinors.

41.3 For further reading
Most quantum ﬁeld theory textbook have extensive discussions of spinor
representations of the Lorentz group and gamma matrices, although most use
the opposite convention for the signature of the Minkowski metric. Typical
examples are Peskin–Schroeder [67] and chapter II.3 and Appendix E of Zee
[105].

Chapter 42

The Poincaré Group
and its Representations

In chapter 19 we saw that the Euclidean group E(3) has inﬁnite dimensional
irreducible unitary representations on the state space of a quantum free particle. The free particle Hamiltonian plays the role of a Casimir operator: to
get irreducible representations one ﬁxes the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian
(the energy), and then the representation is on the space of solutions to
the Schrödinger equation with this energy. There is also a second Casimir
operator, with integral eigenvalue the helicity, which further characterizes
irreducible representations. The case of helicity ± 12 (which uses the double
 occurs for solutions of the Pauli equation, see section 34.2.
cover E(3))
For a relativistic analog, treating space and time on the same footing,
we will use instead the semi-direct product of space–time translations and
Lorentz transformations, called the Poincaré group. Irreducible representations of this group will again be labeled by eigenvalues of two Casimir operators, giving in the cases relevant to physics one continuous parameter (the
mass) and a discrete parameter (the spin or helicity). These representations
can be realized as spaces of solutions for relativistic wave equations, with such
representations corresponding to possible relativistic elementary particles.
For an element (a, Λ) of the Poincaré group, with a a space–time translation and Λ an element of the Lorentz group, there are three diﬀerent sorts of
actions of the group and Lie algebra to distinguish:
• The action

x → Λx + a

on a Minkowski space vector x. This is an action on a real vector space,
it is not a unitary representation.

• The action
ψ → u(a, Λ)ψ(x) = S(Λ)ψ(Λ−1 (x − a))
on n-component wavefunctions, solutions to a wave equation (here S is
an n-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group). These will be
the unitary representations classiﬁed in this chapter.
• The space of single-particle wavefunctions can be used to construct a
quantum ﬁeld theory, describing arbitrary numbers of particles. This will
come with an action on the state space by unitary operators U (a, Λ).
This will be a unitary representation, but very much not irreducible.
For the corresponding Lie algebra actions, we will use lower case letters (e.g.,
tj , lj ) to denote the Lie algebra elements and their action on Minkowski space,
upper case letters (e.g., Pj , Lj ) to denote the Lie algebra representation on
 j ) to denote the Lie
wavefunctions, and upper case hatted letters (e.g., Pj , L

42.1 The Poincaré group and its Lie
algebra
Definition (Poincaré group). The Poincaré group is the semi-direct product
P = R4  SO(3, 1)
with double cover

P̃ = R4  SL(2, C)

The action of SO(3, 1) or SL(2, C) on R4 is the action of the Lorentz group
on Minkowski space.
We will refer to both of these groups as the “Poincaré group,” meaning by
this the double cover only when we need it because spinor representations of
the Lorentz group are involved. The two groups have the same Lie algebra, so
the distinction is not needed in discussions that only involve the Lie algebra.
Elements of the group P will be written as pairs (a, Λ), with a ∈ R4 and
Λ ∈ SO(3, 1). The group law is
(a1 , Λ1 )(a2 , Λ2 ) = (a1 + Λ1 a2 , Λ1 Λ2 )

42.1

The Poincaré group and its Lie algebra

529

The Lie algebra Lie P = Lie P̃ has dimension 10, with basis
t0 , t1 , t2 , t3 , l1 , l2 , l3 , k1 , k2 , k3
where the ﬁrst four elements are a basis of the Lie algebra of the translation
group, and the next six are a basis of so(3, 1), with the lj giving the subgroup
of spatial rotations, the kj the boosts. We already know the commutation
relations for the translation subgroup, which is commutative so
[tj , tk ] = 0
We have seen in chapter 40 that the commutation relations for so(3, 1) are
[l1 , l2 ] = l3 , [l2 , l3 ] = l1 , [l3 , l1 ] = l2
[k1 , k2 ] = −l3 , [k3 , k1 ] = −l2 , [k2 , k3 ] = −l1
or
[lj , lk ] = jkl ll , [kj , kk ] = −jkl ll
and that the commutation relations between the lj and kj are
[lj , kk ] = jkl kl
corresponding to the fact that the kj transform as a vector under spatial
rotations.
The Poincaré group is a semi-direct product group of the sort discussed in
chapter 18 and it can be represented as a group of 5 by 5 matrices in much
the same way as elements of the Euclidean group E(3) could be represented
by 4 by 4 matrices (see chapter 19). Writing out this isomorphism explicitly
for a basis of the Lie algebra, we have

(42.1)

We can use this explicit matrix representation to compute the commutators of the inﬁnitesimal translations tj with the inﬁnitesimal rotations and
boosts (lj , kj ). t0 commutes with the lj and t1 , t2 , t3 transform as a vector
under rotations, For rotations one ﬁnds
[lj , tk ] = jkl tl
For boosts one has
[kj , t0 ] = tj , [kj , tj ] = t0 , [kj , tk ] = 0 if j = k, k = 0

(42.2)

Note that inﬁnitesimal boosts do not commute with inﬁnitesimal time translation, so after quantization boosts will not commute with the Hamiltonian.
Boosts will act on spaces of single-particle wavefunctions in a relativistic
theory, and on states of a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, but are not symmetries in the sense of preserving spaces of energy eigenstates.

42.2 Irreducible representations
of the Poincaré group
We would like to construct unitary irreducible representations of the Poincaré
group. These will be given by unitary operators u(a, Λ) on a Hilbert space
H1 , which will have an interpretation as a single-particle relativistic quantum
state space. In the analogous non-relativistic case, we constructed unitary
 as
irreducible representations of E(3) (or its double cover E(3))

42.2

Irreducible representations of the Poincaré group

• The space of wavefunctions of a free particle of mass m, with a ﬁxed
energy E (chapter 19). These are solutions to
Dψ = Eψ
where
D=−

1 2
∇
2m

and the ψ are single-component wavefunctions. E(3) acts on wavefunctions by
ψ → u(a, R)ψ(x) = ψ(R−1 (x − a))
• The space of solutions of the “square root” of the Pauli–Schrödinger
equation (see section 34.2). These are solutions to
√
Dψ = ± 2mEψ
where
D = −iσ · ∇
 acts on wavefunctions
and the ψ are two-component wavefunctions. E(3)
by
ψ → u(a, Ω)ψ(x) = Ωψ(R−1 (x − a))
(where R is the SO(3) element corresponding to Ω ∈ SU (2) in the double
cover).
In both cases, the group action commutes with the diﬀerential operator, or
equivalently one has uDu−1 = D, and this is what ensures that the operators
u(a, Ω) take solutions to solutions.
To construct representations of P, we would like to generalize this construction from R3 to Minkowski space M 4 . To do this, one begins by deﬁning
an action of P on n-component wavefunctions by
ψ → u(a, Λ)ψ(x) = S(Λ)ψ(Λ−1 (x − a))
This is the action one gets by identifying n-component wavefunctions with
(functions on M 4 ) ⊗ Cn
and using the induced action on functions for the ﬁrst factor in the tensor
product, on the second factor taking S(Λ) to be an n-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group.

532

42 The Poincaré Group and its Representations

One then chooses a diﬀerential operator D on n-component wavefunctions,
one that commutes with the group action, so
u(a, Λ)Du(a, Λ)−1 = D
The u(a, Λ) then give a representation of P on the space of solutions to the
wave equation
Dψ = cψ
for c a constant, and in some cases this will give an irreducible representation.
If the space of solutions is not irreducible, an additional set of “subsidiary
conditions” can be used to pick out a subspace of solutions on which the
representation is irreducible. In later chapters, we will consider several examples of this construction, but now will turn to the general classiﬁcation of
representations of P.
Recall that in the E(3) case, we had two Casimir operators:
P 2 = P12 + P22 + P32
and
J·P
Here Pj is the representation operator for Lie algebra representation, corresponding to an inﬁnitesimal translation in the j-direction. Jj is the operator
for an inﬁnitesimal rotation about the j-axis. The Lie algebra commutation
relations of E(3) ensure that these two operators commute with the action
of E(3) and thus, by Schur’s lemma, act as a scalar on an irreducible representation. Note that the fact that the ﬁrst Casimir operator is a diﬀerential
operator in position space and commutes with the E(3) action means that
the eigenvalue equation
P 2 ψ = cψ
has a space of solutions that is a E(3) representation, and potentially irreducible.
In the Poincaré group case, we can easily identify:
Definition (Casimir operator). The Casimir (or first Casimir) operator for
the Poincaré group is the operator
P 2 = −P02 + P12 + P22 + P32

42.2

Irreducible representations of the Poincaré group

533

A straightforward calculation using the Poincaré Lie algebra commutation
relations shows that P 2 is a Casimir operator since one has
[P0 , P 2 ] = [Pj , P 2 ] = [Jj , P 2 ] = [Kj , P 2 ] = 0
for j = 1, 2, 3. Here Jj is a Lie algebra representation operator corresponding
to the lj , and Kj the operator corresponding to kj .
The second Casimir operator is more diﬃcult to identify in the Poincaré
case than in the E(3) case. To ﬁnd it, ﬁrst deﬁne:
Definition (Pauli–Lubanski operator). The Pauli–Lubanski operator is the
four-component operator
W0 = −P · J, W = −P0 J + P × K
By use of the commutation relations, one can show that the components
of Wμ behave like a four-vector, i.e.,
[Wμ , Pν ] = 0
and the commutation relations with the Jj and Kj are the same for Wμ as
for Pμ . One can then deﬁne:
Definition (Second Casimir operator). The second Casimir operator for the
Poincaré Lie algebra is
W 2 = −W02 + W12 + W22 + W32
Use of the commutation relations shows that
[P0 , W 2 ] = [Pj , W 2 ] = [Jj , W 2 ] = [Kj , W 2 ] = 0
so W 2 is a Casimir operator.
To classify Poincaré group representations, we have two tools available. We
can use the two Casimir operators P 2 and W 2 and characterize irreducible
representations by their eigenvalues. In addition, recall from chapter 20 that
irreducible representations of semi-direct products N  K are associated with
pairs of a K-orbit Oα for α ∈ N̂ , and an irreducible representation of the
corresponding little group Kα .
For the Poincaré group, N̂ = R4 is the space of characters (one-dimensional
representations) of the translation group of Minkowski space. Elements α are
labeled by
p = (p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 )

534

42 The Poincaré Group and its Representations

where the pμ are the eigenvalues of the energy–momentum operators Pμ .
For representations on wavefunctions, these eigenvalues will correspond to
elements in the representation space with space–time dependence.
ei(−p0 x0 +p1 x1 +p2 x2 +p3 x3 )
Given an irreducible representation, the operator P 2 will act by the scalar
−p20 + p21 + p22 + p23
which can be positive, negative, or zero, so given by m2 , −m2 , 0 for various
m. The value of the scalar will be the same everywhere on the orbit, so in
energy–momentum space, orbits will satisfy one of the three equations
⎧
2
⎪
⎨−m
−p20 + p21 + p22 + p23 = m2
⎪
⎩
0
The representation can be further characterized in one of two ways:
• By the value of the second Casimir operator W 2 .
• By the representation of the stabilizer group Kp on the eigenspace of
the momentum operators with eigenvalue p.
At the point p on an orbit, the Pauli–Lubanski operator has components
W0 = −p · J, W = −p0 + p × K
In the next chapter, we will ﬁnd the possible orbits, then pick a point p on
each orbit and see what the stabilizer group Kp and Pauli–Lubanski operator
are at that point.

42.3 Classification of representations
by orbits
The Lorentz group acts on the energy–momentum space R4 by
p → Λp
and, restricting attention to the p0 p3 plane, the picture of the orbits looks
like this

Unlike the Euclidean group case, here there are several diﬀerent kinds of
orbits Op . We will examine them and the corresponding stabilizer groups Kp
each in turn and see what can be said about the associated representations.

42.3.1 Positive energy time-like orbits
One way to get negative values −m2 of the Casimir P 2 is to take the vector p = (m, 0, 0, 0), m > 0 and generate an orbit O(m,0,0,0) by acting on it
with the Lorentz group. This will be the upper, positive energy, sheet of the
hyperboloid of two sheets
−p20 + p21 + p22 + p23 = −m2
so
p0 =

p21 + p22 + p23 + m2

536

42 The Poincaré Group and its Representations

The stabilizer group of K(m,0,0,0) is the subgroup of SO(3, 1) of elements
of the form


1 0
0 R
where R ∈ SO(3), so K(m,0,0,0) = SO(3). Irreducible representations of this
group are classiﬁed by the spin. For spin 0, points on the hyperboloid can be
identiﬁed with positive energy solutions to a wave equation called the Klein–
Gordon equation, and functions on the hyperboloid both correspond to the
space of all solutions of this equation and carry an irreducible representation
of the Poincaré group. This case will be studied in detail in chapters 43
and 44. We will study the case of spin 12 in chapter 47, where one must
use the double cover SU (2) of SO(3). The Poincaré group representation
will be on functions on the orbit that takes values in two copies of the spinor
representation of SU (2). These will correspond to solutions of a wave equation
called the massive Dirac equation. For choices of higher spin representations
of the stabilizer group, one can again ﬁnd appropriate wave equations and
construct Poincaré group representations on their space of solutions (although
additional subsidiary conditions are often needed), but we will not enter into
this topic.
For p = (m, 0, 0, 0) the Pauli–Lubanski operator will be
W0 = 0, W = −mJ
and the second Casimir operator will be
W 2 = m2 J 2
The eigenvalues of W 2 are thus proportional to the eigenvalues of J 2 , the
Casimir operator for the subgroup of spatial rotations. These are again given
by the spin s and will take the values s(s + 1). These eigenvalues classify
representations consistently with the stabilizer group classiﬁcation.

42.3.2 Negative energy time-like orbits
Starting instead with the energy–momentum vector p = (−m, 0, 0, 0), m > 0,
the orbit O(−m,0,0,0) one gets is the lower, negative energy component of the
hyperboloid
−p20 + p21 + p22 + p23 = −m2
satisfying
p0 = −

p21 + p22 + p23 + m2

42.3

Classification of representations by orbits

537

Again, one has the same stabilizer group K(−m,0,0,0) = SO(3) and the same
constructions of wave equations of various spins and Poincaré group representations on their solution spaces as in the positive energy case. Since negative
energies lead to unstable, unphysical theories, we will see that these representations are treated diﬀerently under quantization, corresponding physically
not to particles, but to antiparticles.

42.3.3 Space-like orbits
One can get positive values m2 of the Casimir P 2 by considering the orbit
O(0,0,0,m) of the vector p = (0, 0, 0, m). This is a hyperboloid of one sheet,
satisfying the equation
−p20 + p21 + p22 + p23 = m2
It is not too diﬃcult to see that the stabilizer group of the orbit is K(0,0,0,m) =
SO(2, 1). This is isomorphic to the group SL(2, R), and it has no ﬁnite
dimensional unitary representations. These orbits correspond physically to
“tachyons,” particles that move faster than the speed of light, and there is
no known way to consistently incorporate them in a conventional theory.

42.3.4 The zero orbit
The simplest case where the Casimir P 2 is zero is the trivial case of a point p =
(0, 0, 0, 0). This is invariant under the full Lorentz group, so the orbit O(0,0,0,0)
is just a single point and the stabilizer group K(0,0,0,0) is the entire Lorentz
group SO(3, 1). For each ﬁnite dimensional representation of SO(3, 1), one
gets a corresponding ﬁnite dimensional representation of the Poincaré group,
with translations acting trivially. These representations are not unitary, so
they are not usable for our purposes. Note that these representations are not
distinguished by the value of the second Casimir W 2 , which is zero for all of
them.

42.3.5 Positive energy null orbits
One has P 2 = 0 not only for the zero vector in momentum space, but for a
three-dimensional set of energy–momentum vectors, called the null-cone. By
the term “cone” one means that if a vector is in the space, so are all products

538

42 The Poincaré Group and its Representations

of the vector times a positive number. Vectors p = (p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 ) are called
“light-like” or “null” when they satisfy
p2 = −p20 + p21 + p22 + p23 = 0
One such vector is p = (|p|, 0, 0, |p|) and the orbit of the vector under the
action of the Lorentz group will be the upper half of the full null-cone, the
half with energy p0 > 0, satisfying
p0 =

p21 + p22 + p23

It turns out that the stabilizer group K|p|,0,0,|p| of p = (|p|, 0, 0, |p|) is
E(2), the Euclidean group of the plane. One way to see this is to use the
matrix representation 42.1 which explicitly gives the action of the Poincaré
Lie algebra on Minkowski space vectors, and note that
l3 , l1 + k2 , l2 − k1
each act trivially on (|p|, 0, 0, |p|). l3 is the inﬁnitesimal spatial rotation about
the 3-axis. Deﬁning
1
1
b1 = √ (l1 + k2 ), b2 = √ (l2 − k1 )
2
2
and calculating the commutators
[b1 , b2 ] = 0, [l3 , b1 ] = b2 , [l3 , b2 ] = −b1
we see that these three elements of the Lie algebra are a basis of a Lie
subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of E(2).
Recall from section 19.1 that there are two kinds of irreducible unitary
representations of E(2):
• Representations such that the two translations act trivially. These are
irreducible representations of SO(2), so one-dimensional and characterized by an integer n (half-integers when the Poincaré group double cover
is used).
• Inﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations on a space of functions
on a circle of radius r.
The ﬁrst of these two cases corresponds to irreducible representations of the
Poincaré group labeled by an integer n, which is called the “helicity” of the
representation. Given the representation, n will be the eigenvalue of J3 acting
on the energy–momentum eigenspace with energy–momentum (|p|, 0, 0, |p|).
We will in later chapters consider the cases n = 0 (massless scalars, wave

539

equation the Klein–Gordon equation), n = ± 12 (Weyl spinors, wave equation the Weyl equation), and n = ±1 (photons, wave equation the Maxwell
equations). The second sort of representation of E(2) corresponds to representations of the Poincaré group known as “continuous spin” representations,
but these seem not to correspond to any known physical phenomena.
Calculating the components of the Pauli–Lubanski operator, one ﬁnds
W0 = −|p|J3 , W1 = −(J1 + K2 ), W2 = −(J2 − K1 ), W3 = −|p|J3
Deﬁning
1
1
B1 = √ (J1 + K2 ), B2 = √ (J2 − K1 )
2
2
the second Casimir operator is given by
W 2 = 2(B12 + B22 )
which is the Casimir operator for E(2). It takes nonzero values on the continuous spin representations but is zero for the representations where E(2) translations act trivially. It does thus not distinguish between massless Poincaré
representations of diﬀerent helicities.

42.3.6 Negative energy null orbits
Looking instead at the orbit of p = (−|p|, 0, 0, |p|), one gets the negative
energy part of the null-cone. As with the time-like hyperboloids of nonzero

same classiﬁcation as in the positive energy case.

For an extensive discussion of the Poincaré group, its Lie algebra and representations, see [97]. Weinberg [99] (chapter 2) has some discussion of the
representations of the Poincaré group on single-particle state spaces that we
have classiﬁed here. Folland [28] (chapter 4.4) and Berndt [9] (chapter 7.5)
discuss the construction of these representations using induced representation
methods (as opposed to the construction as solution spaces of wave equations
that we will use in following chapters).

The Klein–Gordon Equation
and Scalar Quantum Fields

In the non-relativistic case, we found that it was possible to build a quantum
theory describing arbitrary numbers of particles by taking as dual phase space
M the single-particle space H1 of solutions to the free particle Schrödinger
equation. To get the same sort of construction for relativistic systems, one
possibility is to take as dual phase space the space of solutions of a relativistic
wave equation known as the Klein–Gordon equation.
A major diﬀerence with the non-relativistic case is that the equation of
motion is second-order in time, so to parametrize solutions in H1 one needs
not just the wavefunction at a ﬁxed time, but also its time derivative. In addition, consistency with conditions of causality and positive energy of states
requires making a very diﬀerent choice of complex structure J, one that is
not the complex structure coming from the complex-valued nature of the
wavefunction (a choice which may in any case be unavailable, since in the
simplest theory Klein–Gordon wavefunctions will be real-valued). In the relativistic case, an appropriate complex structure Jr is deﬁned by complexifying
the space of solutions, and then taking Jr to have value +i on positive energy
solutions and −i on negative energy solutions. This implies a diﬀerent physical interpretation than in the non-relativistic case, with a nonnegative energy
assignment to states achieved by interpreting negative energy solutions as corresponding to positive energy antiparticle states moving backward in time.

43.1 The Klein–Gordon equation
and its solutions
To get a single-particle theory describing an elementary particle with a unitary action of the Poincaré group, one can try to take as single-particle state
space any of the irreducible representations classiﬁed in chapter 42. There we
found that such irreducible representations are characterized in part by the

this is negative, we have the operator equation
P 2 = −P02 + P12 + P22 + P32 = −m2

(43.1)

and we would like to ﬁnd a state space with momentum operators satisfying
this relation. We can use wavefunctions φ(x) on Minkowski space to get such
a state space.
Just as in the non-relativistic case, where we could represent momentum
operators as either multiplication operators on functions of the momenta,
or diﬀerentiation operators on functions of the positions, here we can do
the same, with functions now depending on the four space–time coordinates.

This equation is the simplest Lorentz invariant (the Lorentz group acting on
functions takes solutions to solutions) wave equation and historically was the
one ﬁrst tried by Schrödinger. He soon realized it could not account for known
facts about atomic spectra and instead used the non-relativistic equation that
bears his name. In this chapter, we will consider the quantization of the space
of real-valued solutions of this equation, with the case of complex-valued
solutions appearing later in section 44.1.2.

in time, solutions φ(t, x) will be parametrized by initial data which, unlike

The integral 43.3 is expressed in a four-dimensional, Lorentz invariant
manner using the delta-function, but this is really an integral over the twocomponent hyperboloid. This can be rewritten as a three-dimensional integral
over R3 by the following argument. For each p, applying equation 11.9 to

To construct a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, we would like to proceed
as in the non-relativistic case of chapters 36 and 37, but taking the dual
phase space M to be the space of solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation
rather than of the Schrödinger equation. As in the non-relativistic case, we
have various ways of specifying an element of M:
• Φ(φ(x), π(x)): the solution with initial data φ(x), π(x) at t = 0.
• A(α(p)): the solution with initial data at t = 0 speciﬁed by the complex
function α(p) on momentum space, related to φ(x), π(x) by equation
43.11.


Quantization will take these to operators Φ(φ(x),
π(x)), A(α(p)).
We can also deﬁne versions of the above that are distributional objects
corresponding to taking the functions φ(x), π(x), α(p) to be delta-functions:
• Φ(x): the distributional solution with initial data φ(x ) = δ(x − x),
π(x) = 0. One then writes

Φ(φ(x), 0) =

Φ(x)φ(x )d3 x

• Π(x): the distributional solution with initial data φ(x ) = 0, π(x ) =

43.2 The symplectic and complex
structures on M
Taking as dual phase space M the space of solutions of the Klein–Gordon
equation, one way to write elements of this space is as pairs of functions (φ, π)
on R3 . The symplectic structure is then given by

(φ1 (x)π2 (x) − π1 (x)φ2 (x))d3 x
(43.12)
Ω((φ1 , π1 ), (φ2 , π2 )) =
R3

and the (φ(x), π(x)) can be thought of as pairs of conjugate coordinates analogous to the pairs qj , pj but with a continuous index x instead of the discrete
index j. Also by analogy with the ﬁnite dimensional case, the symplectic
structure can be written in terms of the distributional ﬁelds Φ(x), Π(x) as
{Φ(x), Π(x )} = δ 3 (x − x ), {Φ(x), Φ(x )} = {Π(x), Π(x )} = 0

(43.13)

We now have a dual phase space M and a symplectic structure on it,
so in principle could quantize using an inﬁnite dimensional version of the
Schrödinger representation, treating the values φ(x) as an inﬁnite number of
position-like coordinates, and taking states to be functionals of these coordinates. It is, however, much more convenient, as in the non-relativistic case of
chapters 36 and 37, to use the Bargmann–Fock representation, treating the
quantum ﬁeld theory system as an inﬁnite collection of harmonic oscillators.
This requires a choice of complex structure, which we will discuss in this
section.
By analogy with the non-relativistic case, it is tempting to try and think of
solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation as wavefunctions describing a single
relativistic particle. A standard physical argument is that a relativistic singleparticle theory describing localized particles is not possible, since once the
position uncertainty of a particle is small enough, its momentum uncertainty
will be large enough to provide the energy needed to create new particles. If
you try and put a relativistic particle in a smaller and smaller box, at some
point you will no longer have just one particle, and it is this situation that
implies that only a many-particle theory will be consistent. This leads one to
expect that any attempt to ﬁnd a consistent relativistic single-particle theory
will run into some sort of problem.

548

43 The Klein–Gordon Equation and Scalar Quantum Fields

One obvious source of trouble are the negative energy solutions. These will
cause an instability if the theory is coupled to other physics, by allowing initial positive energy single-particle states to evolve to states with arbitrarily
negative energy, transferring positive energy to the other physical system they
are coupled to. This can be dealt with by restricting to the space of solutions
of positive energy, taking H1 to be the space of complex solutions with positive energy (i.e., letting φ take complex values and setting f (−ωp , −p) = 0
in equation 43.5). One then has solutions


R3

f (ωp , p)e−iωp t eip·x

parametrized by complex functions f of p.
This choice of H1 gives a theory much like the non-relativistic free particle
Schrödinger case (and which has that theory as a limit if one takes the speed
of light to ∞). The factor of ωp required by Lorentz invariance, however,
leads to the following features (which disappear in the non-relativistic limit):
• There are no states describing localized particles, since one can show
that solutions φ(t, x) of the form 43.14 cannot have compact support
in x. The argument is that if they did, the Fourier transforms of both
φ and its time derivative φ̇ would be analytic functions of p. But the
Fourier transforms of solutions would satisfy
∂ 
 p)
φ(t, p) = −iωp φ(t,
∂t
This leads to a contradiction, since the left-hand side must be analytic,
but the right-hand side cannot be (it is a product of an analytic function,
and a non-analytic function, ωp ).
• A calculation of the propagator (see section 43.5) shows that it is nonzero
for space-like separated points. This implies a potential violation of
causality once interactions are allowed, with inﬂuence from what happens at one point in space–time traveling to another at faster than the
speed of light.
To construct a multiparticle theory with this H1 along the same lines as
the non-relativistic case, we would need to introduce a complex conjugate
space H1 and then apply the Bargmann–Fock method. We would then be
quantizing a theory with dual phase space a subspace of the solutions of
the complex Klein–Gordon equation, those satisfying a condition (positive
energy) that is non-local in space–time.
A more straightforward way to construct this theory is to start with dual
phase space M the real-valued solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation. This
is a real vector space with no given complex structure, but recall equation
43.11, which describes points in M by a complex function α(p) rather than a

43.2

pair of real functions φ(x) and π(x). We can take this as a choice of complex
structure, deﬁning:
Definition (Relativistic complex structure). The relativistic complex structure on the space M is given by the operator Jr that, extended to M ⊗ C, is
+i on the α(p), −i on the α(p).
The A(p) are then a continuous basis of M+
Jr , the A(p) a continuous basis
and
of M−
Jr
−
M ⊗ C = M+
Jr ⊕ M Jr
A confusing aspect of this setup is that after complexiﬁcation of M to get
M ⊗ C, α(p) and α(p) are not complex conjugates in general, only on the
real subspace M. We are starting with a real dual phase space M, which can
be parametrized by complex functions
f+ (p) = f (ωp , p), f− (p) = f (−ωp , p)
that satisfy the reality condition (see equation 43.6)
f− (p) = f+ (−p)
Complexifying, M ⊗ C will be given by pairs f+ , f− of complex functions,
with no reality condition relating them. The choice of relativistic complex
structure Jr is such that M+
Jr is the space of pairs with f− = 0 (the complex
functions on the positive energy hyperboloid), M−
Jr is the space of pairs
with f+ = 0 (complex functions on the negative energy hyperboloid). The
conjugation map on M ⊗ C is not the map conjugating the values of f− or
f+ . It is the map that interchanges
(f+ (p), f− (p)) ←→ (f− (−p), f+ (−p))
The α(p) and α(p) given by
f+ (p)
f− (−p)
α(p) = 
, α(p) = 
2ωp
2ωp
(see equation 43.7) are related by this nonstandard conjugation (only on real
solutions is α(p) the complex conjugate of α(p)).
Also worth keeping in mind is that, while in terms of the α(p) the complex structure Jr is just multiplication by i, for the basis of ﬁeld variables
(φ(x), π(x)), Jr is not multiplication by i, but something much more complicated. From equation 43.11, one sees that multiplication by i on the α(p)
corresponds to

(φ(x), π(x)) →
π(x), −ωp φ(x)
ωp

550

43 The Klein–Gordon Equation and Scalar Quantum Fields

on the φ(x), π(x) coordinates. This transformation is compatible with the
symplectic structure (preserves the Poisson bracket relations 43.13). As a
transformation on position space solutions, the momentum is the diﬀerential
operator p = −i∇, so Jr needs to be thought of as a non-local operation that
can be written as
(φ(x), π(x)) →



π(x), −



−∇2 + m2 φ(x)

(43.15)

Poisson brackets of the continuous basis elements A(p), A(p) are given by
{A(p), A(p )} = {A(p), A(p )} = 0, {A(p), A(p )} = iδ 3 (p − p ) (43.16)
Recall from section 26.2 that given a symplectic structure Ω and positive,
compatible complex structure J on M, we can deﬁne a Hermitian inner
product on M+
J by
u, v = iΩ(u, v)
for u, v ∈ M+
J . For the case of M real solutions to the Klein–Gordon equation, we have on basis elements A(p) of M+
Jr
A(p), A(p ) = iΩ(A(p), A(p )) = i{A(p), A(p )} = δ 3 (p − p )

(43.17)

As a Hermitian inner product on elements α(p) ∈ M+
Jr , which is our singleparticle state space H1 , equation 43.17 implies that

α1 (p)α2 (p)d3 p
(43.18)
α1 (p), α2 (p) =
R3

This inner product on H1 will be positive deﬁnite and Lorentz invariant.
Note the diﬀerence with the non-relativistic case, where one has the same
E(3) invariant inner product on the position space ﬁelds or their momentum
space Fourier transforms. In the relativistic case, the Hermitian inner product is only the simple one (43.18) on the momentum space initial data for
solutions α(p) but another quite complicated one on the position space data
φ(x), π(x) (due to the complicated expression 43.15 for Jr there). Unlike the
Hermitian inner product and Jr , the symplectic form is simple in both position and momentum space versions, see the Poisson bracket relations 43.13
and 43.16.
Digression. Quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks often contain a discussion of a
non-positive Hermitian inner product on the space of Klein–Gordon solutions,

which can be shown to be independent of t. This is deﬁned on M ⊗ C, the
complexiﬁed Klein–Gordon solutions, and is zero on the real-valued solutions,
so does not provide an inner product on those. It does not use the relativistic
complex structure. If we start with a theory of complex Klein–Gordon ﬁelds,
the function φ, φ will be the moment map for the U (1) action by phase
transformations on the ﬁelds. It will carry an interpretation as charge and
give after quantization the charge operator. This will be discussed in section

43.4 Quantization of the Klein–Gordon
theory
Given the description we have found in momentum space of real solutions of
the Klein–Gordon equation and the choice of complex structure Jr described
in the last section, we can proceed to construct a quantum ﬁeld theory by the
Bargmann–Fock method in a manner similar to the non-relativistic quantum
ﬁeld theory case. Quantization takes
†
A(α(p)) ∈ M+
Jr = H1 → a (α(p))

A(α(p)) ∈ M−
Jr = H1 → a(α(p))
Here A(α(p)) is the positive energy solution of the (complexiﬁed) Klein–
Gordon equation with initial data given by α(p) and a† (α(p)) is the operator
on the Fock space of symmetric tensor products of H1 given by equation 36.12.
A(α(p)) is the conjugate negative energy solution and a(α(p)) is the operator
given by equation 36.13. All these objects are often written in distributional
form, where one has
A(p) → a† (p), A(p) → a(p)
which one can interpret as corresponding to taking the limit of α(p ) →
δ(p − p ).
The operators a(α(p)) and a† (α(p)) satisfy the commutation relations
[a(α1 (p)), a† (α2 (p))] = α1 (p), α2 (p)
or in distributional form
[a(p), a† (p )] = δ 3 (p − p )

relation, which in that case was E(p) = |p|
2m . The diﬀerent complex structure
used for quantization in the relativistic theory changes the physical meaning
of annihilation and creation operators:
• Non-relativistic theory. M = H1 is the space of complex solutions of the
free particle Schrödinger equation, which all have positive energy. H1
is the conjugate space. For each continuous basis element A(p) of H1
(these are initial data for a positive energy solution with momentum p),
quantization takes this to a creation operator a† (p), which acts with
the physical interpretation of addition of a particle with momentum p.
Quantization of the complex conjugate A(p) in H1 gives an annihilation
operator a(p), which removes a particle with momentum p.
• Relativistic theory. M+
Jr = H1 is the space of positive energy solutions
of the Klein–Gordon equation. It has continuous basis elements A(p)
which after quantization become creation operators adding a particle
of momentum p and energy ωp . M−
Jr is the space of negative energy
solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation. Its continuous basis elements
A(p) after quantization become annihilation operators for antiparticles
of momentum −p and positive energy ωp .
To make physical sense of the quanta in the relativistic theory, assigning
all non-vacuum states a positive energy, we take such quanta as having two
physically equivalent descriptions:
• A positive energy particle moving forward in time with momentum p.
• A positive energy antiparticle moving backward in time with momentum −p.
The operator a† (p) adds such quanta to a state, and the operator a(p)
destroys them. Note that for a theory of quantized real-valued Klein–Gordon
−
ﬁelds, the ﬁeld Φ has components in both M+
Jr and MJr so its quantization
will both create and destroy quanta.
Just as in the non-relativistic case (see equation 37.1) quantum ﬁeld operators can be deﬁned using the momentum space decomposition and annihilation and creation operators:

an annihilation operator component and a creation operator component. This
gives a theory of positive energy quanta that can be interpreted as either particles moving forward in time or antiparticles of opposite momentum moving
backward in time.

43.5 The scalar field propagator
As for any quantum ﬁeld theory, a fundamental quantity to calculate is the
propagator, which for a free quantum ﬁeld theory actually can be used to
calculate all amplitudes between multiparticle states. For the free relativistic
scalar ﬁeld theory, we have
Definition (Propagator, Klein–Gordon theory). The propagator for the relativistic scalar ﬁeld theory is the amplitude
 2 , x2 )Φ(t
 1 , x1 )|0
U (t2 , x2 , t1 , x1 ) = 0|Φ(t
By translation invariance, the propagator will only depend on t2 − t1 and
x2 − x1 , so we can just evaluate the case (t1 , x1 ) = (0, 0), (t2 , x2 ) = (t, x),
using the formula 43.23 for the time-dependent quantum ﬁeld to get

As in the non-relativistic case (see section 12.5), this is a distribution that
can be deﬁned as a boundary value of an analytic function of complex time.
The integral can be evaluated in terms of Bessel functions, and its properties
are discussed in all standard quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks. These include:

The scalar field propagator

557

• For x = 0, the amplitude is oscillatory in time, a superposition of terms
with positive frequency.
• For t = 0, the amplitude falls oﬀ exponentially as e−m|x| .
The resolution of the potential causality problem caused by the nonzero
amplitude at space-like separations between (t1 , x1 ) and (t2 , x2 ) (e.g., for t1 =
t2 ) is that the condition really needed on observable operators O localized at
points in space–time is that
[O(t2 , x2 ), O(t1 , x1 )] = 0
for (t1 , x1 ) and (t2 , x2 ) space-like separated (this condition is known as
“micro-causality”). This will ensure that measurement of the observable O
at a point will not aﬀect its measurement at a space-like separated point,
avoiding potential conﬂicts with causality. For the ﬁeld operator Φ(t, x), one
can calculate the commutator by a similar calculation to the one above for
U (t, x, 0, 0), with result

that the vanishing of this commutator for space-like separations is achieved
by cancellation of propagation amplitudes for a particle and antiparticle,
showing that the relativistic choice of complex structure for quantization is
needed to ensure causality.
One can also study the propagator using Green’s function methods as in

In the non-relativistic case, the Green’s function G
p0 = |p|2 /2m. Two possible choices of how to extend integration over p0 into
the complex plane avoiding the pole gave either a retarded Green’s function
and propagation from past to future, or an advanced Green’s function and
propagation from future to past. In the Klein–Gordon case, there are now
two poles, at p0 = ±ωp . Micro-causality requires that the pole at positive
energy be treated as a retarded Green’s function, with propagation of positive
energy particles from past to future, while the one at negative energy must be
treated as an advanced Green’s function with propagation of negative energy
particles from future to past.

43.6 Interacting scalar field theories: some
comments
Our discussion so far has dealt purely with a theory of non-interacting quanta,
so this theory is called a quantum theory of free ﬁelds. The ﬁeld, however, can
be used to introduce interactions between these quanta, interactions which
are local in space. The simplest such theory is the one given by adding a
quartic term to the Hamiltonian, taking



 4 : d3 x
H=
: (Π(x)
+ (∇Φ(x))
+ m2 Φ(x)
R3 2
This interacting theory is vastly more complicated and much harder to understand than the non-interacting theory. Among the diﬃcult problems that
arise are:
• How should one make sense of the expression
 4:
:Φ(x)
since it is a product not of operators but of operator-valued distributions?
• How can one construct an appropriate state space on which the interacting Hamiltonian operator will be well deﬁned, with a well-deﬁned
ground state?
Quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks explain how to construct a series expansion
in powers of λ about the free ﬁeld value λ = 0, by a calculation whose terms
are labeled by Feynman diagrams. To get ﬁnite results, cutoﬀs must ﬁrst be
introduced, and then some way found to get a sensible limit as the cutoﬀ
is removed (this is the theory of “renormalization”). In this manner ﬁnite
results can be found for the terms in the series expansion, but the expansion

43.6

Interacting scalar field theories: some comments

559

is not convergent, giving only an asymptotic series (for ﬁxed λ, no matter
how small, the series will diverge at high enough order).
For known calculational methods not based on the series expansion, again
a cutoﬀ must be introduced, making the number of degrees of freedom ﬁnite.
For a ﬁxed ultraviolet cutoﬀ, corresponding physically to only allowing ﬁelds
with momentum components smaller than a given value, one can construct
a sensible theory with non-trivial interactions (e.g., scattering of one particle
by another, which does not happen in the free theory). This gives a sensible
theory, for momenta far below the cutoﬀ. However, it appears that, for three
or more spatial dimensions, removal of the cutoﬀ will always in the limit give
back the non-interacting free ﬁeld theory. There is thus no known continuum
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory of scalar ﬁelds, other than free ﬁeld theory,
that can be constructed in this way.

43.7 For further reading
Pretty much every quantum ﬁeld theory textbook has a treatment of the
relativistic scalar ﬁeld with more detail than given here and signiﬁcantly
more physical motivation. A good example is the lectures of Sidney Coleman
[15], one that has some detailed versions of the calculations discussed here
is chapter 5 of [16]. Chapter 2 of [67] covers the same material, with more
discussion of the propagator and the causality question.
For a more detailed rigorous construction of the Klein–Gordon theory in
terms of Fock space, closely related to the outline given in this chapter, three
sources are
• Chapter X.7 of [73].
• Chapter 5.2 of [28].
• Chapter 8.2.2 of [17].
For a general axiomatic mathematical treatment of relativistic quantum
ﬁelds as distribution-valued operators, some standard references are [87] and
[12]. The second of these includes a rigorous construction of the Klein–Gordon
theory.
For a treatment of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory relatively close to ours,
not only for the Klein–Gordon theory of this chapter, but also for the spin- 12
theories of later chapters, see [33].

Chapter 44

Symmetries and Relativistic Scalar
Quantum Fields

Just as for non-relativistic quantum ﬁelds, the theory of free relativistic scalar
quantum ﬁelds starts by taking as phase space an inﬁnite dimensional space
of solutions of an equation of motion. Quantization of this phase space proceeds by constructing ﬁeld operators which provide a representation of the
corresponding Heisenberg Lie algebra, using an inﬁnite dimensional version of
the Bargmann–Fock construction. In both cases, the equation of motion has
a representation-theoretical signiﬁcance: It is an eigenvalue equation for the
Casimir operator of a group of space–time symmetries, picking out an irreducible representation of that group. In the non-relativistic case, the Laplacian Δ was the Casimir operator, the symmetry group was the Euclidean
group E(3), and one got an irreducible representation for ﬁxed energy. In the
relativistic case, the Casimir operator is the Minkowski space version of the
Laplacian
∂2
− 2 +Δ
∂t
the space–time symmetry group is the Poincaré group, and the eigenvalue of
the Casimir is m2 .
The Poincaré group acts on the phase space of solutions to the Klein–
Gordon equation, preserving the Poisson bracket. The same general methods
as in the ﬁnite dimensional and non-relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory cases
can be used to get a representation of the Poincaré group by intertwining
operators for the Heisenberg Lie algebra representation (the representation
given by the ﬁeld operators). These methods give a representation of the Lie
algebra of the Poincaré group in terms of quadratic combinations of the ﬁeld
operators.
We will begin though with the case of an even simpler group action on the
phase space, that coming from an “internal symmetry” of multicomponent
scalar ﬁelds with an orthogonal group or unitary group acting on the real or
complex vector space in which the classical ﬁelds take their values. For the

44 Symmetries and Relativistic Scalar Quantum Fields

simplest case of ﬁelds taking values in R2 or C, one gets a theory of charged
relativistic particles, with antiparticles now distinguishable from particles
(they have opposite charge).

44.1 Internal symmetries
The relativistic real scalar ﬁeld theory of chapter 43 lacks one important
feature of the non-relativistic theory, which is an action of the group U (1)
by phase changes on complex ﬁelds. This is needed to provide a notion of
“charge” and allow the introduction of electromagnetic forces into the theory
(see chapter 45). In the real scalar ﬁeld theory, there is no distinction between
states describing particles and states describing antiparticles. To get a theory
with such a distinction, we need to introduce ﬁelds with more components.
Two possibilities are to consider real ﬁelds with m components, in which case
we will have a theory with SO(m) symmetry, or to consider complex ﬁelds
with n components, in which case we have a theory with U (n) symmetry.
Identifying C with R2 using the standard complex structure, we ﬁnd SO(2) =
U (1), and two equivalent ways of getting a theory with U (1) symmetry, using
two real or one complex scalar ﬁeld.

44.1.1 SO(m) symmetry and real scalar fields
Starting with the case m = 2, and taking as dual phase space M the space of
pairs φ1 , φ2 of real solutions to the two-component Klein–Gordon equation,
elements g(θ) of the group SO(2) will act on the ﬁelds by

Here, Φ1 (x), Φ2 (x), Π1 (x), Π2 (x) are the continuous basis elements for the
space of two-component Klein–Gordon solutions, determined by their initial
values at t = 0.
This group action on M breaks up into a direct sum of an inﬁnite number (one for each value of x) of identical copies of the case of rotations in
a conﬁguration space plane, as discussed in section 20.3.1. We will use the
calculation there, where we found that for a basis element L of the Lie algebra of SO(2), the corresponding quadratic function on the phase space with

44.1

coordinates q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 was
μL = q1 p2 − q2 p1
For the case here, we take
q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 → Φ1 (x), Φ2 (x), Π1 (x), Π2 (x)
and integrate the analog of μL over R3 to get an appropriate moment map
for the ﬁeld theory case. This gives a quadratic functional on the ﬁelds that
will have the desired Poisson bracket with the ﬁelds for each value of x.
We will denote the result by Q, since it is an observable that will have a
physical interpretation as electric charge when this theory is coupled to the
electromagnetic ﬁeld (see chapter 45):

44.1.2 U(1) symmetry and complex scalar fields
Instead of describing a scalar ﬁeld system with SO(2) symmetry using a
pair Φ1 , Φ2 of real ﬁelds, it is sometimes more convenient to work with complex scalar ﬁelds and a U (1) symmetry. This will also allow the use of ﬁeld
operators and annihilation and creation operators for states with a deﬁnite
value of the charge observable. Taking as M the complex vector space of
complex solutions to the Klein–Gordon equation, however, is confusing, since
the Bargmann–Fock quantization method requires that we complexify M,
and the complexiﬁcation of a complex vector space is a notion that requires
some care. More simply, here one can think of the space M of solutions to
the Klein–Gordon equation for a pair of real ﬁelds as having two diﬀerent
complex structures:
• The relativistic complex structure Jr , which is +i on positive energy
solutions in M ⊗ C and −i on negative energy solutions in M ⊗ C.
• The “charge” complex structure JC , which is +i on positive charge solutions and −i on negative charge solutions.
The operators Jr and JC will commute, so we can simultaneously diagonalize
them on M ⊗ C and decompose the positive energy solution space into ±i
eigenspaces of JC , so
+
−
H1 = M+
Jr = H 1 ⊕ H 1
where H1+ will be positive energy solutions with JC = +i and H1− will be
positive energy solutions with JC = −i. Taking as before α1 (p), α2 (p) for
the momentum space initial data for elements of H1 , we will deﬁne
1
1
α(p) = √ (α1 (p) − iα2 (p)) ∈ H1+ , β(p) = √ (α1 (p) + iα2 (p)) ∈ H1−
2

The negative energy solution space can be decomposed as

α(p) = √ (α1 (p) + iα2 (p)) ∈ H1+ , β(p) = √ (α1 (p) − iα2 (p)) ∈ H1−
2

We will write A(p), B(p) for the solutions α, β with initial data deltafunctions at p, A(p), B(p) for their conjugates, and quantization will take

with the nonzero commutation relations between these operators given by
[a(p), a† (p )] = δ(p − p ), [b(p), b† (p )] = δ(p − p )
The state space of this theory is a tensor product of two copies of the state
space of a real scalar ﬁeld. The operators a† (p), a(p) act on the state space
by creating or annihilating a positively charged particle of momentum p,
whereas the b† (p), b(p) create or annihilate antiparticles of negative charge.
The vacuum state will satisfy
a(p)|0 = b(p)|0 = 0
The Hamiltonian operator for this theory will be

its adjoint will be a ﬁeld Φ (x) which will act on states by increasing the
charge by 1, with one term that creates particles and another that annihilates

44.2 Poincaré symmetry and scalar fields
Returning to the case of a single real relativistic ﬁeld, the dual phase space M
carries an action of the Poincaré group P, and the quantum ﬁeld theory will
come with a unitary representation of this group, in much the same way that
the non-relativistic case came with a representation of the Euclidean group
E(3) (see section 38.3). The Poincaré group acts on the space of solutions
to the Klein–Gordon equation since its action on functions on space–time
commutes with the Casimir operator

This Poincaré group action on Klein–Gordon solutions is by the usual
action on functions
φ → u(a, Λ)φ = φ(Λ−1 (x − a))

(44.5)

induced from the group action on Minkowski space. On ﬁelds Φ(x) the
action is
Φ → u(a, Λ)Φ = Φ(Λx + a)

44.2

Poincaré symmetry and scalar fields

569

Quantization should give unitary operators U (a, Λ), which act on ﬁeld operators by
 → U (a, Λ)Φ(x)U


Φ
(a, Λ)−1 = Φ(Λx
+ a)
(44.6)
The U (a, Λ) will provide a unitary representation of the Poincaré group on
the quantum ﬁeld theory state space, acting by intertwining operators of the
sort discussed in the ﬁnite dimensional context in chapter 20. We would like
to construct these operators by the usual method: using the moment map
to get a quadratic polynomial on phase space, quantizing to get Lie algebra
representation operators, and then exponentiating to get the U (a, Λ).
This will require that the symplectic structure on the phase space H1 be
Poincaré invariant. The Poisson bracket relations on the position space ﬁelds
{Φ(x), Π(x )} = δ 3 (x − x ), {Φ(x), Φ(x )} = {Π(x), Π(x )} = 0
are easily seen to be invariant under the action of the Euclidean group of
spatial translations and rotations by
Φ(x) → Φ(Rx + a), Π(x) → Π(Rx + a)
(since the delta-function is). Things are not so simple for the rest of the
Poincaré group, since the deﬁnition of the Φ(x), Π(x) is based on a choice
of the distinguished t = 0 hyperplane. In addition, the complicated form of
the relativistic complex structure Jr in these coordinates (see equation 43.15)
makes it diﬃcult to see if this is invariant under Poincaré transformations.
Taking Fourier transforms, recall that solutions to the Klein–Gordon equation can be written as (see 43.3)
φ(t, x) =

1
(2π)3/2


R4

δ(p20 − ωp2 )f (p)ei(−p0 t+p·x) d4 p

so these are given by functions (actually distributions) f (p) on the positive
and negative energy hyperboloids. The complex structure Jr is +i on functions on the negative energy hyperboloid, −i on functions on the positive
energy hyperboloid. The action of the Poincaré group preserves Jr , since it
acts separately on the negative and positive energy hyperboloids. It also preserves the Hermitian inner product (see equations 43.17 and 43.18) and thus
gives a unitary action on M+
Jr = H 1 .
Just as for the ﬁnite dimensional case in chapter 25 and the non-relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theory case in section 38.3, we can ﬁnd for each element L of
the Lie algebra of the group acting (here the Poincaré group P) a quadratic
expression in the A(p), A(p) (this is the moment map μL ). Quantization
then gives a corresponding normal-ordered quadratic operator in terms of
the operators a† (p), a(p).

the expression for the momentum operator. This is a similar calculation to

by the fact that the basic Poisson bracket relations are

Note that the operators L
act on the energy eigenstates of the state space, providing unitary representations of the group SO(3) on these energy eigenspaces. Energy eigenstates
will be characterized by the irreducible representation of SO(3) they are in,
so as spin s = 0, s = 1, . . . states.

44.2.3 Boosts
From the point of view that a symmetry of a physical theory corresponds to
a group action on the theory that commutes with time translation, Lorentz
boosts are not symmetries because they do not commute with time translations (see the commutators in equation 42.2). From the Lagrangian point
of view though, boosts are symmetries because the Lagrangian is invariant

572

44 Symmetries and Relativistic Scalar Quantum Fields

under them. From our Hamiltonian point of view, they act on phase space,
preserving the symplectic structure. They thus have a moment map, and
quantization will give a quadratic expression in the ﬁeld operators which,
when exponentiated, will give a unitary action on the multiparticle state
space.
Note that boosts preserve not only the symplectic structure, but also the
relativistic complex structure Jr , since they preserve the decomposition of
momentum space coordinates into separate coordinates on the positive and
negative energy hyperboloids. As a result, when expressed in terms of creation

One can check that this gives a Poincaré Lie algebra representation on

the expressions 43.22, 44.7, 44.8, and 44.10, for H,

ωp , p, p × i∇p , iωp ∇p

44.3 For further reading
The operators corresponding to various symmetries of scalar quantum ﬁelds
described in this chapter are discussed in many quantum ﬁeld theory books,
with a typical example chapter 4 of [35]. In these books, the form of the operators is typically derived from an invariance of the Lagrangian via Noether’s
theorem rather than by the Hamiltonian moment map methods used here.

U (1) Gauge Symmetry
and Electromagnetic Fields

We have now constructed both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum ﬁeld
theories for free scalar particles. In the non-relativistic case, we had to use
complex-valued ﬁelds and found that the theory came with an action of a U (1)
group, the group of phase transformations on the ﬁelds. In the relativistic
case, real-valued ﬁelds could be used, but if we took complex-valued ones (or
used pairs of real-valued ﬁelds), again there was an action of a U (1) group of
phase transformations. This is the simplest example of a so-called “internal
 called the
symmetry,” and it is reﬂected in the existence of an operator Q
“charge.”
In this chapter, we will see how to go beyond the theory of free quantized
charged particles, by introducing background electromagnetic ﬁelds that the
charged particles will interact with. It turns out that this can be done using
the U (1) group action, but now acting independently at each point in spacetime, giving a large, inﬁnite dimensional group called the “gauge group.”
This requires introducing a new sort of space–time-dependent ﬁeld, called
a “vector potential” by physicists, a “connection” by mathematicians. Use
of this ﬁeld allows the construction of a Hamiltonian dynamics invariant
under the gauge group. This ﬁxes the way charged particles interact with
electromagnetic ﬁelds, which are described by the vector potential.
Most of our discussion will be for the case of the U (1) group, but we will
also indicate how this generalizes to the case of non-Abelian groups such as
SU (2).

45.1 U(1) gauge symmetry

with integral eigenvalues on the space of states. Instead of acting on ﬁelds
by multiplication by a constant phase eiϕ , one can imagine multiplying by
a phase that varies with the coordinates x. Such phase transformations are
called “gauge transformations” and form an inﬁnite dimensional group under
point-wise multiplication:
Definition (Gauge group). The group G of functions on M 4 with values in
the unit circle U (1), with group law given by point-wise multiplication
eieϕ1 (x) · eieϕ2 (x) = eie(ϕ1 (x)+ϕ2 (x))
is called the U (1) gauge group, or group of U (1) gauge transformations.
Here x = (x0 , x) ∈ M 4 , e is a constant, and ϕ is a real-valued function
ϕ(x) : M 4 → R
The vector space of such functions is the Lie algebra Lie G, with a trivial
Lie bracket. The constant e determines the normalization of the Lie algebravalued ϕ(x), with its appearance here a standard convention (such that it does
not appear in the Hamiltonian, Poisson brackets, or equations of motion).
The group G acts on complex functions ψ of space–time as
ψ(x) → eieϕ(x) ψ(x), ψ(x) → e−ieϕ(x) ψ(x)
Note that in quantum mechanics, this is a group action on the wavefunctions,
and it does not correspond to any group action on the ﬁnite dimensional
phase space of coordinates and momenta, so has no classical interpretation. In
quantum ﬁeld theory though, where these wavefunctions make up the phase
space to be quantized, this is a group action on the phase space, preserving
the symplectic structure.
Terms in the Hamiltonian that just involve |ψ(x)|2 = ψ(x)ψ(x) will be
invariant under the group G, but terms with derivatives such as
|∇ψ|2
will not, since when

ψ → eieϕ(x) ψ(x)

U(1) gauge symmetry

To deal with this problem, one introduces a new kind of ﬁeld:
Definition (Connection or vector potential). A U (1) connection (mathematician’s terminology) or vector potential (physicist’s terminology) is a function A on space–time M 4 taking values in R4 , with its components denoted
Aμ (x) = (A0 (t, x), A(t, x))
The gauge group G acts on the space of U (1) connections by
Aμ (t, x) → Aϕ
μ (t, x) ≡ Aμ (t, x) +

∂ϕ(t, x)
∂xμ

(45.1)

The vector potential allows one to deﬁne a new kind of derivative, such
that the derivative of the ﬁeld ψ has the same homogeneous transformation
properties under G as ψ itself:
Definition (Covariant derivative). Given a connection A, the associated
covariant derivative in the μ direction is the operator
DμA =

∂

With this deﬁnition, the eﬀect of a gauge transformation is

which will be invariant under the inﬁnite dimensional group G. The procedure
of starting with a theory of complex ﬁelds and then introducing a connection
while changing derivatives to covariant derivatives in the equations of motion
is called the “minimal coupling prescription.” It determines how a theory of
complex free ﬁelds describing charged particles can be turned into a theory
of ﬁelds coupled to a background electromagnetic ﬁeld, in the simplest or
“minimal” way.

45.2 Curvature, electric and magnetic
fields
While the connection or vector potential A is the fundamental geometrical
quantity needed to construct theories with gauge symmetry, one often wants
to work instead with certain quantities derived from A that are invariant
under gauge transformations. To a mathematician this is the curvature of
a connection, and to a physicist these are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld
strengths derived from a vector potential. The deﬁnition is:
Definition (Curvature of a connection, electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths). The
curvature of a connection Aμ is given by

Fμν = [DμA , DνA ]
e
which can more explicitly be written
Fμν =

∂Aν
∂Aμ
−
∂xμ
∂xν

Note that while DμA is a diﬀerential operator, [DμA , DνA ] and thus the curvature
is just a multiplication operator.
The electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths break up into those components with
a time index and those without:
Definition (Electric and magnetic ﬁelds). The electric and magnetic ﬁelds
are two functions from R4 to R3 , with components given by

ﬁeld, as discussed in section 44.1.2. In all three cases, in principle a quantum
ﬁeld theory can be deﬁned by taking the space of solutions of the equation
as phase space, and applying the Bargmann–Fock quantization method (in
practice this is diﬃcult, since in general there is no translation invariance and
no plane-wave basis of solutions).

Digression. For readers familiar with diﬀerential forms, A can be thought
of as an element of Ω1 (M 4 ), the space of 1-forms on space–time M 4 . The
path-dependent phase γ A is then the standard integral of a 1-form along a
curve γ. The curvature of A is simply the 2-form F = dA, where d is the de
Rham diﬀerential. The gauge group acts on connections by
A → A + dϕ
and the curvature is gauge invariant since
F → F + d(dϕ)
and d satisﬁes d2 = 0.

and γ is the boundary of a surface S (γ = ∂S), then

Note that if F = 0, then γ A = 0 for any closed curve γ, and this can be used

this, consider any two paths γ1 and γ2 from γ(0) to γ(1), and γ = γ1 − γ2

deﬁned. This method only works for the single-particle theory, with minimal
coupling for a quantum theory of ﬁelds given by the replacement of derivatives
by covariant derivatives described earlier.

45.5 The non-Abelian case
We saw in section 38.2.2 that quantum ﬁeld theories with a U (m) group acting
on the ﬁelds can be constructed by taking m-component complex ﬁelds and
a Hamiltonian that is the sum of the single complex ﬁeld Hamiltonians for
each component. The constructions of this chapter generalize from the U (1)
to U (m) case, getting a gauge group G of maps from R4 to U (m), as well
as a generalized notion of connection and curvature. In this section, we will
outline how this works, without going into full detail. The non-Abelian U (m)
case is a relatively straightforward generalization of the U (1) case, except
for the deﬁnition of the curvature, where new terms with diﬀerent behavior
arise, due to the non-commutative nature of the group.
The diagonal U (1) ⊂ U (m) subgroup is treated using exactly the same
formalism for the vector potential, covariant derivative, electric and magnetic
ﬁelds as above. It is only the SU (m) ⊂ U (m) subgroup which requires a
separate treatment. We will do this just for the case m = 2, which is known
as the Yang-Mills case, since it was ﬁrst investigated by the physicists Yang
and Mills in 1954. We can think of the iϕ(x) in the U (1) case as a function
valued in the Lie algebra u(1) and replace it by a matrix-valued function,
taking values in the Lie algebra su(2) for each x. This can be written in
terms of three functions ϕa as
iϕ(x) = i



using the Pauli matrices. The gauge group becomes the group GY M of maps
from space–time to SU (2), with Lie algebra the maps iϕ(x) from space–time
to su(2). Unlike the U (1) case, this Lie algebra has a non-trivial Lie bracket,
given by the point-wise su(2) Lie bracket (the commutator of matrices).

In the SU (2) case, the analog of the real-valued function Aμ will now be
matrix-valued and one can write

Instead of one vector potential function for each space–time direction μ, we
now have three (the Aaμ (x)), and we will refer to these functions as the connection or “gauge ﬁeld.” The complex ﬁelds ψ are now two-component ﬁelds,
and the covariant derivative is

For the theories of complex ﬁelds with U (m) symmetry discussed in chapters 38 and 44, this is the m = 2 case. Replacing derivatives by covariant
derivatives yields non-relativistic and relativistic theories of matter particles
coupled to background gauge ﬁelds.
In the Yang-Mills case, the curvature or ﬁeld strengths can still be deﬁned
as a commutator of covariant derivatives, but now this is a commutator of
matrix-valued diﬀerential operators. The result will as in the U (1) case be a
multiplication operator, but it will be matrix-valued. The curvature can be
deﬁned as

which can be calculated much as in the Abelian case, except now the term

electric and magnetic ﬁeld strength components as in the U (1) case, the
equations for matrix-valued electric and magnetic ﬁelds are:

The Yang-Mills theory thus comes with electric and magnetic ﬁelds that
now are valued in su(2) and can be written as 2 by 2 matrices, or in terms of
the Pauli matrix basis, as ﬁelds Ea (x) and Ba (x) indexed by a = 1, 2, 3. These
ﬁelds are no longer linear in the Aμ ﬁelds, but have extra quadratic terms.

These non-quadratic terms will introduce nonlinearities into the equations of
motion for Yang-Mills theory, making its study much more diﬃcult than the
U (1) case.

Most electromagnetism textbooks in physics will have some discussion of the
vector potential, electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and gauge transformations. A

physics is [29]. [30] is a recent textbook aimed at mathematicians that covers
the subject of electromagnetism in detail.

Quantization of the Electromagnetic
Field: the Photon

Understanding the classical ﬁeld theory of coupled dynamical scalar ﬁelds
and vector potentials is rather diﬃcult, with the quantized theory even more
so, due to the fact that the Hamiltonian is no longer quadratic in the ﬁeld
variables and the ﬁeld equations are nonlinear. Simplifying the problem by
ignoring the scalar ﬁelds and only considering the vector potentials gives a
theory with quadratic Hamiltonian that can be readily understood and quantized. The classical equations of motion are the linear Maxwell equations in a
vacuum, with solutions electromagnetic waves. The corresponding quantum
ﬁeld theory will be a relativistic theory of free, massless particles of helicity
±1, the photons.
To get a physically sensible theory of photons, the inﬁnite dimensional
group G of gauge transformations that acts on the classical phase space
of solutions to the Maxwell equations must be taken into account. We will
describe several methods for doing this, carrying out the quantization in detail
using one of them. All of these methods have various drawbacks, with unitarity and explicit Lorentz invariance seemingly impossible to achieve simultaneously. The reader should be warned that due to the much greater complexities
involved, this chapter and succeeding ones will be signiﬁcantly sketchier than
most earlier ones.

46.1 Maxwell’s equations
We saw in chapter 45 that our quantum theories of free particles could be
coupled to a background electromagnetic ﬁeld by introducing vector potential
ﬁelds Aμ = (A0 , A). Electric and magnetic ﬁelds are deﬁned in terms of Aμ
by the equations

In this chapter, we will see how to make the Aμ ﬁelds dynamical variables,
although restricting to the special case of free electromagnetic ﬁelds, without
interaction with matter ﬁelds. The equations of motion will be:

and Gauss’s law:

(46.4)

Digression. In terms of diﬀerential forms, these equations can be written
very simply as
dF = 0, d ∗ F = 0
where the ﬁrst equation is equivalent to 46.1 and 46.2, and the second (which
uses the Hodge star operator for the Minkowski metric) is equivalent to 46.3
and 46.4. Note that the ﬁrst equation is automatically satisﬁed, since by definition F = dA, and the d operator satisﬁes d2 = 0.
Writing out equation 46.1 in terms of the vector potential gives
∇·∇×A=0
which is automatically satisﬁed for any vector ﬁeld A. Similarly, in terms of
the vector potential, equation 46.2 is

46.2 The Hamiltonian formalism for
electromagnetic fields
In order to quantize the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we ﬁrst need to express
Maxwell’s equations in Hamiltonian form. These equations are second-order
diﬀerential equations in t, so we expect to parametrize solutions in terms of
initial data


∂A0
∂A
(0, x),
(0, x)
(46.5)
(A0 (0, x), A(0, x)) and
∂t
∂t
The problem with this is that gauge invariance implies that if Aμ is a solution
with this initial data, so is its gauge transform Aϕ
μ (see equation 45.1) for any
function ϕ(t, x) such that
ϕ(0, x) = 0,

∂ϕ
(t, x) = 0
∂t

This implies that solutions are not uniquely determined by the initial data
of the vector potential and its time derivative at t = 0, and thus, this initial
data will not provide coordinates on the space of solutions.
One way to deal with this problem is to try and ﬁnd conditions on the
vector potential which will remove this freedom to perform such gauge transformations and then take as phase space the subspace of initial data satisfying
the conditions. This is called making a “choice of gauge.” We will begin with:
Definition (Temporal gauge). A vector potential Aμ is said to be in temporal
gauge if A0 = 0.
Note that given any vector potential Aμ , we can ﬁnd a gauge transformation ϕ
such that the gauge transformed vector potential will have A0 = 0 by solving
the equation
∂ϕ
(t, x) = A0 (t, x)
∂t
which has solution
ϕ(t, x) =

 t
0

A0 (τ, x)dτ + ϕ0 (x)

(46.6)

where ϕ0 (x) = ϕ(0, x) is any function of the spatial variables x.
In temporal gauge, initial data for a solution to Maxwell’s equations is
given by a pair of functions

A(x),


∂A

588

and we can take these as our coordinates on the phase space of solutions.
The electric ﬁeld is now
∂A
E=−
∂t
so we can also write our coordinates on phase space as
(A(x), −E(x))
Requiring that these coordinates behave just like position and momentum
coordinates in the ﬁnite dimensional case, we can specify the Poisson bracket
and thus the symplectic form by
{Aj (x), Ak (x )} = {Ej (x), Ek (x )} = 0
{Aj (x), Ek (x )} = −δjk δ 3 (x − x )
If we then take as Hamiltonian function

Hamilton’s equations become

and

The ﬁnal Maxwell’s equation, Gauss’s law (46.4), does not appear in the
Hamiltonian formalism as an equation of motion. In later sections, we will
see several diﬀerent ways of dealing with this problem.
For the Yang–Mills case, in temporal gauge we can again take as initial data (A(x), −E(x)), where these are now matrix-valued. For the Hamiltonian, we can use the trace function on matrices and take

since
X1 , X2  = tr(X1 X2 )
is a non-degenerate, positive, SU (2) invariant inner product on su(2). One of
Hamilton’s equations is then equation 46.9, which is also just the deﬁnition
of the Yang–Mills electric ﬁeld when A0 = 0 (see equation 45.3).
The other Hamilton’s equation can be shown to be
∂Ej
(t, x) ={Ej (t, x), h}
∂t
=(∇ × B)j − iejkl [Ak , Bl ]

(46.11)

where B is the Yang–Mills magnetic ﬁeld (45.4). If a covariant derivative
acting on ﬁelds valued in su(2) is deﬁned by
∇A (·) = ∇(·) − ie[A, ·]
then equation 46.11 can be written
∂E
(t, x) = ∇A × B
∂t
The problem with these equations is that they are nonlinear equations in
A, so the phase space of solutions is no longer a linear space, and diﬀerent
methods are needed for quantization of the theory.

46.3 Gauss’s law and time-independent
gauge transformations
Returning to the U (1) case, a problem with the temporal gauge is that
Gauss’s law (equation 46.4) is not necessarily satisﬁed. At the same time, the
group G0 ⊂ G of time-independent gauge transformation will act
non-trivially on the phase space of initial data of Maxwell’s equations, preserving the temporal gauge condition A0 = 0 (see equation 46.6). We will
see that the condition of invariance under this group action can be used to
impose Gauss’s law.
It is a standard fact from the theory of electromagnetism that
∇ · E = ρ(x)
is the generalization of Gauss’s law to the case of a background electric charge
density ρ(x). A failure of Gauss’s law can thus be interpreted physically as

590

46 Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field: the Photon

due to the inclusion of states with background electric charge, rather than
just electromagnetic ﬁelds in the vacuum.
There are two diﬀerent ways to deal with this kind of problem:
• Before quantization, impose Gauss’s law as a condition on the phase
space.
• After quantization, impose Gauss’s law as a condition on the states,
deﬁning the physical state space Hphys ⊂ H as the subspace of states
satisfying

∇ · E|ψ
=0
 is the quantized electric ﬁeld.
where E
To understand what happens if one tries to implement one of these choices,
consider ﬁrst a much simpler example, that of a non-relativistic particle in
3 dimensions, with a potential that does not depend on one conﬁguration
variable, say q3 . The system has a symmetry under translations in the 3
direction, and the condition
(46.12)
P3 |ψ = 0
on states will commute with time evolution since [P3 , H] = 0. In the
Schrödinger representation, since
P3 = −i

∂
∂q3

if we deﬁne Hphys as the subset of states satisfying 46.12, this can be identiﬁed
with the space of wavefunctions of two position variables q1 , q2 . One technical
problem that appears at this point is that the original inner product includes
an integral over the q3 coordinate, which will diverge since the wavefunction
will be independent of this coordinate.
If the condition p3 = 0 is instead imposed before quantization (i.e., on
the phase space coordinates), the phase space will now be ﬁve dimensional,
with coordinates q1 , q2 , q3 , p1 , p2 , and it will no longer have a non-degenerate
symplectic form. It is clear that what we need to do to get a phase space
whose quantization will have state space Hphys is to remove the dependence
on the coordinate q3 .
In general, if we have a group G acting on a phase space M , we can deﬁne:
Definition (Symplectic reduction). Given a group G acting on phase space
M , preserving the Poisson bracket, with moment map
M → g∗
the symplectic reduction M //G is the quotient space μ−1 (0)/G.

46.3

Gauss’s law and time-independent gauge transformations

591

We will not show this here, but under appropriate conditions the space
M //G will have a non-degenerate symplectic form. It can be thought of as
the phase space describing the G-invariant degrees of freedom of the phase
space M . What one would like to be true is that “quantization commutes
with reduction”: Quantization of M //G gives a quantum system with state
space Hphys identical to the G-invariant subspace of the state space H of
the quantization of M . Rarely are both M and M //G the sort of linear
phase spaces that we know how to quantize, so this should be thought of
as a desirable property for schemes that allow quantization of more general
symplectic manifolds.
For the case of a system invariant under translations in the 3-direction,
M = R6 , G = R, g = R) and the moment map takes as value (see equation
15.12) the element of g∗ given by μ(q, p) where
μ(q, p)(a) = ap3
μ−1 (0) will be the subspace of phase space with p3 = 0. On this space, the
translation group acts by translating the coordinate q3 , so we can identify
M //R = μ−1 (0)/R = R4
with the phase space with coordinates q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 . In this case, quantization will commute with reduction since imposing P3 |ψ = 0 or quantizing
M //R give the same space of states (in the Schrödinger representation, the
wavefunctions of position variables q1 , q2 ).
This same principle can be applied in the inﬁnite dimensional example of
the temporal gauge phase space with coordinates
(A(x), −E(x))
and an action of the group G0 of time-independent gauge transformations,
with Lie algebra the functions ϕ(x). In this case, the condition μ = 0 will
just be Gauss’s law. To see this, note that the moment map μ ∈ (Lie G0 )∗

(using integration by parts in the ﬁrst step, the Poisson bracket relations in
the second). This agrees with the deﬁnition in section 15.3 of the moment
map, since ∇ϕ(x) is the inﬁnitesimal change in A(x) for an inﬁnitesimal
gauge transformation ϕ(x). One can similarly show that, as required since E
is gauge invariant, μ satisﬁes
{μ, E(x)} = 0

46.4 Quantization in Coulomb gauge
A diﬀerent method for dealing with the time-independent gauge transformations is to impose an additional gauge condition. For any vector potential
satisfying the temporal gauge condition A0 = 0, a gauge transformation can
be found such that the transformed vector potential satisﬁes:
Definition (Coulomb gauge). A vector potential Aμ is said to be in Coulomb
gauge if ∇ · A = 0.
To see that this is possible, note that under a gauge transformation one
has
∇ · A → ∇ · A + ∇2 ϕ
so such a gauge transformation will put a vector potential in Coulomb gauge
if we can ﬁnd a solution to
∇2 ϕ = −∇ · A

(46.13)

Using Green’s function methods like those of section 12.7, this equation for
ϕ can be solved, with the result

ϕ(x) =

Since in temporal gauge

the Coulomb gauge condition automatically implies that Gauss’s law (46.4)
will hold. We thus can take as phase space the solutions to the Maxwell
equations satisfying the two conditions A0 = 0, ∇ · A = 0, with phase space
coordinates the pairs (A(x), −E(x)) satisfying the constraints ∇ · A = 0,
∇ · E = 0.

Quantization in Coulomb gauge

Note the appearance here of the following problem: Unlike the scalar ﬁeld
case (equation 43.8) where the Fourier coeﬃcients were unconstrained functions, here they satisfy a condition (equation 46.16), and the αj (p) cannot
simply be quantized as independent annihilation operators for each j. Solving
equation 46.16 and reducing the number of degrees of freedom by introducing the polarization vectors σ involves an arbitrary choice and makes the
properties of the theory under the action of the Lorentz group much harder
to understand. A similar problem for solutions to the Dirac equation will
appear in chapter 47.

46.5 Space–time symmetries
The choice of Coulomb gauge nicely isolates the two physical degrees of freedom that describe photons and allows a straightforward quantization in terms
of two copies of the previously studied relativistic scalar ﬁeld. It does, however, do this in a way which makes some aspects of the Poincaré group action
on the theory hard to understand, in particular the action of boost transformations. Our choice of continuous basis elements for the space of solutions of
the Maxwell equations was not invariant under boost transformations (since
it uses initial data at a ﬁxed time, see equation 46.5), but making the gauge
choice A0 = 0, ∇ · A = 0 creates another fundamental problem. Acting by a
boost on a solution in this gauge will typically take it to a solution no longer
satisfying the gauge condition.
For some indication of the diﬃculties introduced by the non-Lorentz invariant Coulomb gauge choice, the ﬁeld commutators can be computed, with the

The right-hand side in the last case is not just the expected delta-function,
but includes a term that is non-local in position space.
In section 46.6, we will discuss what happens with a Lorentz invariant
gauge choice, but for now will just consider the Poincaré subgroup of spacetime translations and spatial rotations, which do preserve the Coulomb gauge
choice. Such group elements can be labeled by (a, R), where a = (a0 , a) is a
translation in space–time, and R ∈ SO(3) is a spatial rotation. Generalizing
the scalar ﬁeld case (equation 44.6), we want to construct a unitary representation of the group of such elements by operators U (a, R) on the state
space, with the U (a, R) also acting as intertwining operators on the ﬁeld
operators, by:

in most quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks).

46.5.3 Rotations
We will not go through the exercise of constructing the angular momentum
 for the electromagnetic ﬁeld that gives the action of rotations on
operator J
the theory. Details of how to do this can for instance be found in chapters 6
and 7 of [35]. The situation is similar to that of the spin 12 Pauli equation case
in section 34.2. There we found that J = L + S where the ﬁrst term is the
“orbital” angular momentum, due to the action of rotations on space, while
S was the inﬁnitesimal counterpart of the SU (2) action on two-component
spinors.
Much the same thing happens in this case, with L due to the action on
spatial coordinates x and S due to the action of SO(3) rotations on the 3
components of the vector A (see equation 46.19). We have seen that in the

Coulomb gauge, the ﬁeld A(x)
decomposes into two copies of ﬁelds behaving
much like the scalar Klein–Gordon theory, corresponding to the two basis
vectors 1 (p), 2 (p) of the plane perpendicular to the vector p. The subgroup

SO(2) ⊂ SO(3) of rotations about the axis p acts on this plane, and its basis
vectors in exactly the same way as the internal SO(2) symmetry acted on
pairs of real Klein–Gordon ﬁelds (see section 44.1.1). In that case, the same
SO(2) acts in the same way at each point in space–time, whereas here this
SO(2) ⊂ SO(3) varies depending on the momentum vector.
 with integer eigenIn the internal symmetry case, we found an operator Q
values (the charge). The analogous operator in this case is the helicity operator. The massless Poincaré group representations described in section 42.3.5
are the ones that occur here, for the case of helicity ±1. Just as in the inter on
nal symmetry case, where complexiﬁcation allowed diagonalization of Q
the single-particle space, getting charges ±1, here complexiﬁcation of the
1 (p), 2 (p) diagonalizes the helicity, getting so-called “left circularly polarized” and “right circularly polarized” photon states.

46.6 Covariant gauge quantization
The methods used so far to handle gauge invariance suﬀer from various
problems that can make their use awkward, most obviously the problem
that they break Lorentz invariance by imposing non-Lorentz invariant conditions (A0 = 0, ∇ · A = 0). Lorentz invariance can be maintained by use of
a Lorentz invariant gauge condition, for example (note that the name is not
a typo):
Definition (Lorenz gauge). A vector potential Aμ is said to be in Lorenz
gauge if
∂A0
+∇·A=0
χ(A) ≡ −
∂t
Besides Lorentz invariance (Lorentz transforms of vector potentials in
Lorenz gauge remain in Lorenz gauge), this gauge has the attractive feature
that Maxwell’s equations become just the standard massless wave equation.

χ(A) = 0.
The four components of Aμ can be treated as four separate solutions of the
massless Klein–Gordon equation and the theory then quantized in a Lorentz

a unitary representation on a harmonic oscillator state space, with a an
annihilation operator and a† a creation operator.
We saw in section 46.3 that in A0 = 0 gauge, there was an analog of the ﬁrst
 = 0 an inconsistent operator equation. There
of these problems, with ∇ · E
∇ · E played the role of a moment map for the group of time-independent
gauge transformations. One can show that similarly, χ(A) plays the role of
a moment map for the group of gauge transformations ϕ satisfying the wave
 = 0 could be
equation 46.20. In the A0 = 0 gauge case, we saw that ∇ · E
treated not as an operator equation, but as a condition on states, determining
the physical state space Hphys ⊂ H.
This will not work for the Lorenz gauge condition, since it can be shown
that there will be no states such that
−

The problem is that, unlike in the Gauss’s law case, the complex structure
Jr used for quantization (+i on the positive energy single-particle states,
−i on the negative energy ones) does not commute with the Lorenz gauge
condition. The gauge condition needs to be implemented not on the dual
phase space M (here the space of Aμ satisfying the massless wave equation),
but on H1 = M+
Jr , where
−
H 1 ⊗ C = M+
Jr ⊕ M Jr

is the decomposition of the complexiﬁcation of H1 into negative and positive
energy subspaces. The condition we want is thus
χ(A)+ = 0
where χ(A)+ is the positive energy part of the decomposition of χ(A) into
positive and negative energy components.
This sort of gauge condition can be implemented either before or after
quantization, as follows:

46.6

• One can take elements of H1 to be C4 -valued functions αμ (p) on R3
with Lorentz invariant indeﬁnite inner product

(−|α0 (p)|2 + |α(p)|2 )d3 p
(46.22)
αμ (p), αν (p ) =

Here, each αμ (p) is deﬁned as in equation 43.7 for the single-component
ﬁeld case. The subspace satisfying χ(A)+ = 0 will be the subspace H1 ⊂
H1 of αμ satisfying
−p0 α0 (p) +

3


pj αj (p) = 0

j=1

This subspace will in turn have a subspace H1+ ⊂ H1+ corresponding to
Aμ that are gauge transforms of 0, i.e., with Fourier coeﬃcients satisfying
α0 (p) = p0 f (p), αj (p) = pj f (p)
for some function f (p). Both of these subspaces carry an action of the
Lorentz group and so does the quotient space
H1+ /H1+
One can show that the indeﬁnite inner product 46.22 is nonnegative on
H1+ and null on H1+ , so positive deﬁnite on the quotient space. Note
that this is an example of a symplectic reduction, although in the context of an action of an inﬁnite dimensional complex group (the positive
energy gauge transformations satisfying the massless wave equation).
One can construct the quantum theory by applying the Bargmann–Fock
method to this quotient space.
• One can instead implement the gauge condition after quantization, ﬁrst
quantizing the four components of Aμ as massless ﬁelds, getting a state
space H (which will not have a positive-deﬁnite inner product), and then
deﬁning H ⊂ H to be the subspace of states satisfying

where the positive energy part of the operator is taken. The state space

Hphys = H /H

602

46 Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field: the Photon

Hphys will have a positive-deﬁnite Hermitian inner product and carry a
unitary action of the Poincaré group. It can be shown to be isomorphic
to the physical state space of transverse photons constructed using the
Coulomb gauge.
This sort of covariant quantization method is often referred to as the “Gupta–
Bleuler” method and is described in more detail in many quantum ﬁeld theory
textbooks.
In the Yang–Mills case, each of the methods that we have discussed for
dealing with the gauge symmetry runs into problems:
• In the A0 = 0 gauge, there again is a symmetry under the group of
time-independent gauge transformations, and a moment map μ, with
μ = 0 the Yang–Mills version of Gauss’s law. The symplectic reduction,
however, is now a nonlinear space, so the quantization method we have
developed does not apply. Gauss’s law can instead be imposed on the
states, but it is diﬃcult to explicitly characterize the physical state space
that this gives.
• A Yang–Mills analog of the Coulomb gauge condition can be deﬁned, but
then the analog of equation 46.13 will be a nonlinear equation without
a unique solution (this problem is known as the “Gribov ambiguity”).
• The combination of ﬁelds χ(A) now no longer satisﬁes a linear wave
equation, and one cannot consistently restrict to a positive energy subspace and use the Gupta–Bleuler covariant quantization method.
Digression. There is a much more sophisticated Lorentz covariant quantization method (called the “BRST method”) for dealing with gauge symmetry
that uses quite diﬀerent techniques. The theory is ﬁrst extended by the addition of non-physical (“ghost”) fermionic ﬁelds, giving a theory of coupled
bosonic and fermionic oscillators of the sort we studied in section 33.1. This
includes an operator analogous to Q1 , with the property that Q21 = 0. One can
arrange things in the electromagnetic ﬁeld case such that
Hphys =

{|ψ : Q1 |ψ = 0}
{|ψ : |ψ = Q1 |ψ  }

In the BRST method, one works with unconstrained Lorentz covariant ﬁelds,
but non-unitary state spaces, with unitarity only achieved on a quotient such
as Hphys . This construction is related to the Gupta–Bleuler method in the case
of electromagnetic ﬁelds, but unlike that method generalizes to the Yang–Mills
case. It can also be motivated by considerations of what happens when one
imposes a gauge condition in a path integral (this is called the “Faddeev–
Popov method”).

The Dirac Equation and Spin 12
Fields

The space of solutions to the Klein–Gordon equation gives an irreducible
representation of the Poincaré group corresponding to a relativistic particle
of mass m and spin zero. Elementary matter particles (quarks and leptons)
are spin 12 particles, and we would like to have a relativistic wave equation
that describes them, suitable for building a quantum ﬁeld theory.
This is provided by a remarkable construction that uses the Cliﬀord algebra and its action on spinors to ﬁnd a square root of the Klein–Gordon equation, the Dirac equation. We will begin with the case of real-valued spinor
ﬁelds, for which the quantum ﬁeld theory describes spin 12 neutral massive
relativistic fermions, known as Majorana fermions. In the massless case, it
turns out that the Dirac equation decouples into two separate equations for
two-component complex ﬁelds, the Weyl equations, and quantization leads
to a relativistic theory of massless helicity ± 21 particles which can carry a
charge, the Weyl fermions. Pairs of Weyl fermions of opposite helicity can be
coupled together to form a theory of charged, massive, spin 12 particles, the
Dirac fermions. In the low energy, non-relativistic limit, the Dirac fermion
theory becomes the Pauli–Schrödinger theory discussed in chapter 34.

Cliﬀ(3, 1) is isomorphic to the algebra M (4, R) of 4 by 4 real matrices. Several
conventional identiﬁcations of the generators γj with 4 by 4 complex matrices
satisfying the relations of the algebra were described in chapter 41. Each of
these gives an identiﬁcation of Cliﬀ(3, 1) with a speciﬁc subset of the complex
matrices M (4, C) and of the complexiﬁed Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ(3, 1) ⊗ C with
M (4, C) itself. The Dirac operator in Minkowski space is thus

and it will act on four-component functions ψ(t, x) = ψ(x) on Minkowski
space. These functions take values in the four-dimensional vector space that
the Cliﬀord algebra elements act on (which can be R4 if using real matrices,
C4 in the complex case).
We have seen in chapter 42 that −P02 + P12 + P22 + P32 is a Casimir operator for the Poincaré group. Acting on four-component wavefunctions ψ(x),
the Dirac operator provides a square root of (minus) this Casimir operator

The quantized Majorana ﬁeld can be understood as an example of a quantization of a pseudo-classical fermionic oscillator system (as described in section
30.3.2), by the fermionic analog of the Bargmann–Fock quantization method
(as described in section 31.3). We take as dual pseudo-classical phase space
V the real-valued solutions of the Dirac equation in the Majorana representation. Using values of the solutions at t = 0, continuous basis elements of V
are given by the four-component distributional ﬁeld Ψ(x), with components
Ψa (x) for a = 1, 2, 3, 4.
This space V comes with an inner product

47 The Dirac Equation and Spin 12 Fields

In this form, the invariance under translations and under spatial rotations is
manifest, with the S(Λ) acting by orthogonal transformations on the Majorana spinors when Λ is a rotation. One way to see this is to note that the
S(Λ) in this case are exponentials of linear combinations of the antisymmetric
matrices γ1M γ2M , γ2M γ3M , γ1M γ3M and thus are orthogonal matrices.
As we have seen in chapter 30, the fermionic Poisson bracket of a pseudoclassical system is determined by an inner product, with the one above giving
in this case
{Ψa (x), Ψb (x )}+ = δ 3 (x − x )δab
The Hamiltonian that will give a pseudo-classical system evolving according
to the Dirac equation is

1
ΨT (x)γ0 (γ · ∇ − m)Ψ(x)d3 x
h=
2 R3
One can see this by noting that the operator γ0 (γ · ∇ − m) is minus its
adjoint with respect to the inner product 47.11, since γ0 is an antisymmetric
matrix, the γ0 γ are symmetric, and the derivative is antisymmetric. Applying
the ﬁnite dimensional theorem 30.1 in this inﬁnite dimensional context, one
ﬁnds that the pseudo-classical equation of motion is
∂
Ψ(x) = {Ψ(x), h}+ = γ0 (γ · ∇ − m)Ψ(x)
∂t
which is the Dirac equation in Hamiltonian form (see equations 47.4 and
47.5). The antisymmetry of the operator γ0 (γ · ∇ − m) that generates time
evolution corresponds to the fact that time evolution gives for each t an
(inﬁnite dimensional) orthogonal group action on the space of solutions V,
preserving the inner product 47.11.
Corresponding to the Poincaré group action 47.9 on solutions to the Dirac
equation, at least for translations by a and rotations Λ, one has a corresponding action on the ﬁelds, written
Ψ(x) → u(a, Λ)Ψ(x) = S(Λ)−1 Ψ(Λ · x + a)

Our use here of the ﬁxed-time ﬁelds Ψ(x) as continuous basis elements on
the phase space V comes with two problematic features:
• One cannot easily implement Lorentz transformations that are boosts,
since these change the ﬁxed-time hypersurface used to deﬁne the Ψ(x).
• The relativistic complex structure on V needed for a consistent quantization is deﬁned by a splitting of V ⊗ C into positive and negative
energy solutions, but this decomposition is only easily made in momentum space, not position space.

47.2.1 Majorana spinor fields in momentum space
Recall that in the case of the real relativistic scalar ﬁeld studied in chapter
43, we had the following expression (equation 43.8) for a solution to the
Klein–Gordon equation
φ(t, x) =

1
(2π)3/2

with α(p) and α(p) parametrizing positive and negative energy subspaces
of the complexiﬁed phase space M ⊗ C. This was quantized by an inﬁnite
dimensional version of the Bargmann–Fock quantization described in chapter
26, with dual phase space M the space of real-valued solutions of the Klein–
Gordon equation, and the complex structure Jr the relativistic one discussed
in section 43.2.
For the Majorana theory, one can write four-component Majorana spinor
solutions to the Dirac equation as follows:

ψ(t, x) =
(2π)3/2

where α(p) is a four-component complex vector, satisfying
− γ0M (γ M · p + im)α(p) = ωp α(p)

(47.13)

These α(p) are the positive energy solutions ψ+ (p) of 47.6, with the conjugate
equation for α(p) giving the negative energy solutions of 47.7 (with the sign
of p interchanged, α(p) = ψ− (−p)).
For each p, there is a two-dimensional space of solutions to equation 47.13.
One way to choose a basis u+ (p), u− (p) of this space is by ﬁrst considering
the case p = 0. The equation 47.13 becomes
γ0M α(0) = iα(0)
which will have a basis of solutions

the ﬁrst having spin “up” in the 3-direction, the second spin “down.”
The Majorana spinor ﬁeld theory comes with a signiﬁcant complication
with respect to the case of scalar ﬁelds. The complex four-component α(p)
provide twice as many basis elements as one needs to describe the solutions
of the Dirac equation (put diﬀerently, they are not independent, but satisfy
the relation 47.13). Quantizing using four sets of annihilation and creation
operators (one for each component of α) would produce a quantum ﬁeld

47.2

Majorana spinors and the Majorana field

theory with too many degrees of freedom by a factor of two. The standard
solution to this problem is to make a choice of basis elements of the space of
solutions for each value of p by deﬁning polarization vectors
u+ (p) = L(p)u+ (0), u− (p) = L(p)u− (0)
Here, L(p) is an element of SL(2, C) chosen so that, acting by a Lorentz
transformation on energy–momentum vectors it takes (m, 0) to (ωp , p). More
explicitly, using equation 40.4, one has



ω p + p3

L† (p) =

p1 + ip2



Such a choice is not unique and is a matter of convention. Explicit choices
are discussed in most quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks (although in a diﬀerent representation of the γ-matrices), see, for instance, chapter 3.3 of [67].
Note that these polarization vectors are not the same as the Bloch sphere
polarization vectors used in earlier chapters. They are deﬁned on the positive
mass hyperboloid, not on the sphere, and for these, there is no topological
obstruction to a continuous deﬁnition.
Solutions are then written as follows:
ψ(t, x) =

One now has the correct number of functions to parametrize pseudo-classical
complexiﬁed dual phase space V ⊗ C. These are the single-component complex functions α+ (p), α− (p), providing elements of VJ+r = H1 and their conjugates α+ (p), α− (p), which provide elements of VJ−r .
To quantize the Majorana ﬁeld in a way that allows a simple understanding
of the action of the full Poincaré group, we need a positive-deﬁnite Poincaré
invariant inner product on the space of solutions of the Dirac equation. We
have already seen what the right inner product is (see equation 47.11), but
unfortunately this is not written in a way that makes Lorentz invariance manifest. Unlike the case of the Klein–Gordon equation, working in momentum
space does not completely resolve the problem. Using the α+ (p), α− (p) allows
for an explicitly positive-deﬁnite inner product, which is just two copies of
the Klein–Gordon one for scalars, see equation 43.18. In the next section, we
will quantize the theory using these. This inner product is not, however, manifestly Lorentz invariant (due to the dependence on the choice of polarization
vectors u± (p)).

47.2.2 Quantization of the Majorana field
Quantization of the dual pseudo-classical phase space M, using the fermionic
Bargmann-Fock method, the relativistic complex structure and the functions
α± (p) from equation 47.14 is given by annihilation and creation operators
a± (p), a†± (p) that anticommute, except for the relations
[a+ (p), a†+ (p )]+ = δ 3 (p − p ), [a− (p), a†− (p )]+ = δ 3 (p − p )
The ﬁeld operator is then constructed using these, giving
Deﬁnition 2 (Majorana ﬁeld operator). The Majorana ﬁeld operator is
given by

Ψ(x,
t) =

(2π)3/2

R3 s=±

If one uses commutation instead of anticommutation relations, the Hamiltonian operator will have eigenstates with arbitrarily negative energy, and
there will be problems with causality due to observable operators at spacelike separated points not commuting. These two problems are resolved by the
use of anticommutation instead of commutation relations. The multiparticle
state space for the theory has occupation numbers 0 or 1 for each value of p
and for each value of s = ±. Like the case of the real scalar ﬁeld, the particles
described by these states are their own antiparticles. Unlike the case of the
real scalar ﬁeld, each particle state has a C2 degree of freedom corresponding
to its spin 12 nature.
One can show that the Hamiltonian and momentum operators are given
by

ωp (a†+ (p)a+ (p) + a†− (p)a− (p))d3 p
R3



and
P=

R3

p(a†+ (p)a+ (p) + a†− (p)a− (p))d3 p

The angular momentum and boost operators are much more complicated to
describe, again due to the dependence of the α± (p) on a choice of polarization
vectors u± (p).
Note that, as in the case of the real scalar ﬁeld, the theory of a single
Majorana ﬁeld has no internal symmetry group acting, so no way to introduce
a charge operator and couple the theory to electromagnetic ﬁelds.

47.3

Weyl spinors

47.3 Weyl spinors
For the case m = 0 of the Dirac equation, it turns out that there is an interesting operator acting on the space of solutions:
Deﬁnition 3 (Chirality). The operator
γ5 = iγ0 γ1 γ2 γ3
is called the chirality operator. It has eigenvalues ±1, and its eigenstates are
said to have chirality ±1. States with chirality +1 are called “right-handed,”
those with chirality −1 are called “left-handed.”
2
Note that the operator JW = −iγ5 = γ0 γ1 γ2 γ3 satisﬁes JW
= −1 and provides a choice of complex structure on the space V of real-valued solutions of
the Dirac equation. We can complexify such solutions and write

V ⊗ C = VL ⊕ V R

(47.15)

where VL is the +i eigenspace of JW (the negative or left-handed chirality
solutions), and VR is the −i eigenspace of JW (the positive or right-handed
chirality solutions).
To work with JW eigenvectors, it is convenient to adopt a choice of γmatrices in which γ5 is diagonal. This cannot be done with real matrices but
requires complexiﬁcation. One such choice was already described in 41.2, the
chiral or Weyl representation. In this choice, the γ-matrices can be written
in 2 by 2 block form as

and the chirality operator is diagonal

We can thus write (complexiﬁed) solutions in terms of chiral eigenstates as

ψ=



where ψL and ψR are two-component wavefunctions, of left and right chirality,
respectively.

Also in the massless case, the chirality operator satisﬁes
[γ5 , HD ] = 0
(HD is the Dirac Hamiltonian 47.5) since for each j
[γ5 , γ0 γj ] = 0
This follows from the fact that commuting γ0 through γ5 gives three minus
signs, commuting γj through γ5 gives another three. In this case, chirality is
a conserved quantity, and the complex structure JW = −iγ5 commutes with
HD . JW then takes positive energy solutions to positive energy solutions,
negative energy to negative energy solutions, and thus commutes with the
relativistic complex structure Jr .
We now have two commuting complex structures JW and Jr on V, and
they can be simultaneously diagonalized (much like the situation in section
44.1.2). We get a decomposition
VJ+r = H1 = H1,L ⊕ H1,R

47.3

Weyl spinors

617

of the positive energy solutions into +i (H1,L ) and −i (H1,R ) eigenspaces of
JW . Restricting to the solutions of equation 47.17 we get a decomposition
VL = H1,L ⊕ H1,L
into positive and negative energy left-handed solutions. We can then take
Weyl spinor ﬁelds to be two-component objects
ΨL (x), ΨL (x)
that are continuous basis elements of H1,L and H1,L , respectively. The action
of the (double cover of the) Poincaré group on space–time-dependent Weyl
ﬁelds will be given by
ΨL (x) → (a, Λ)ΨL (x) = S(Λ)−1 ΨL (Λ · x + a)
where Λ is an element of Spin(3, 1), and S(Λ) ∈ SL(2, C) is the ( 12 , 0) representation (see chapter 41, where S(Λ) = Ω). Λ · x is the Spin(3, 1) action on
Minkowski space vectors.
Just as in the Majorana case, parametrizing the space of solutions using
ﬁxed-time ﬁelds does not allow one to see the action of boosts on the ﬁelds.
In addition, we know that relativistic ﬁeld quantization requires use of the
relativistic complex structure Jr , which is not simply expressed in terms of
the ﬁxed-time ﬁelds. To solve both problems, we need to study the solutions in momentum space. To ﬁnd solutions in momentum space, we Fourier
transform using

and see that the Weyl equations are
(p0 − σ · p)ψR = 0
(p0 + σ · p)ψL = 0
Since

(p0 + σ · p)(p0 − σ · p) = p20 − (σ · p)2 = p20 − |p|2

both ψR and ψL satisfy

(p20 − |p|2 )ψ = 0

Deﬁnition 5 (Helicity). The operator

2 |p|

(47.18)

on the space of solutions to the Weyl equations is called the helicity operator.
It has eigenvalues ± 12 , and its eigenstates are said to have helicity ± 12 .
The helicity operator is the component of the spin operator S = 12 σ along the
direction of the momentum of a particle. Single-particle helicity eigenstates
of eigenvalue + 12 are said to have “right-handed helicity,” and described as
having spin in the same direction as their momentum, those with helicity
eigenvalue − 12 are said to have “left-handed helicity” and spin in the opposite
direction to their momentum.
A continuous basis of solutions to the Weyl equation for ψL is given by
the wavefunctions
uL (p)ei(−p0 x0 +p·x)
where the polarization vector uL (p) ∈ C2 satisﬁes
σ · puL (p) = −p0 uL (p)
Note that the uL (p) are the same basis elements of a speciﬁc p-dependent
C ⊂ C2 subspace ﬁrst seen in the case of the Bloch sphere in section 7.5,
and later in the case of solutions to the Pauli equation (the u− (p) of equation 34.8 is uL (p) for positive energy, the u+ (p) of equation 34.7 is uL (p)
for negative energy). The positive energy (p0 = |p|) solutions have negative
helicity, while the negative energy (p0 = −|p|) solutions have positive helicity. After quantization, this wave equation leads to a quantum ﬁeld theory
describing massless left-handed helicity particles and right-handed helicity
antiparticles. Unlike the case of the Majorana ﬁeld, the theory of the Weyl
ﬁeld comes with a non-trivial internal symmetry, due to the action of the
group U (1) on solutions by multiplication by a phase, and this allows the
introduction of a charge operator.

47.3

Weyl spinors

619

Recall that our general analysis of irreducible representations of the
Poincaré group in chapter 42 showed that we expected to ﬁnd such representations by looking at functions on the positive and negative energy null-cones,
with values in representations of SO(2), the group of rotations preserving
the vector p. Acting on solutions to the Weyl equations, the generator of this
group is given by the helicity operator (equation 47.18). The solution space
to the Weyl equations provides the expected irreducible representations of
helicity ± 12 and of either positive or negative energy.

47.4 Dirac spinors
In section 47.2, we saw that four-component real Majorana spinors could
be used to describe neutral massive spin 12 relativistic particles, while in
section 47.3, we saw that with two-component complex Weyl spinors one
could describe charged massless spin 12 particles. To get a theory of charged
massive spin 12 particles, one needs to double the number of degrees of freedom, which one can do in two diﬀerent ways, with equivalent results:
• In section 44.1.2, we saw that one could get a theory of charged scalar
relativistic particles, by taking scalar ﬁelds valued in R2 . One can do
much the same thing for Majorana ﬁelds, having them take values in
R4 ⊗ R2 rather than R4 . The theory will then, as in the scalar case,
have an internal SO(2) = U (1) symmetry by rotations of the R2 factor,
a charge operator, and potential coupling to an electromagnetic ﬁeld
(using the covariant derivative). It will describe charged massive spin
1
2 particles, with antiparticle states that are now distinguishable from
particle states.
• Instead of a pair of Majorana spinor ﬁelds, one can take a pair ψL , ψR of
Weyl ﬁelds, with opposite signs of eigenvalue for JW . This will describe
massive spin 12 particles and antiparticles. The U (1) symmetry acts in
the same way on the ψL and the ψR , so they have the same charge.
One can also consider the U (1) action that is the inverse on ψL of that
on ψR , but it is only in the case m = 0 that the corresponding charge
commutes with the Hamiltonian (in which case, the theory is said to
have an “axial symmetry”).
The conventional starting point in physics textbooks is that of C4 -valued
spinor ﬁelds, a point of view we have avoided in order to keep straight the
various ways in which complex numbers enter the theory. One should consult
any quantum ﬁeld theory textbook for an extensive discussion of this case,
something we will not try and reproduce here. A standard topic in such textbooks is to show how the Pauli–Schrödinger theory of section 34 is recovered
in the non-relativistic limit, where |p|/m goes to zero.

47.5 For further reading
The material of this chapter is discussed in detail in every textbook on relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. These discussions usually start with the massive
Dirac spinor case, only later restricting to the massless case and Weyl spinors.
They may or may not contain some discussion of the Majorana spinor case,
usually described by imposing a condition on the Dirac case removing half
the degrees of freedom (see, for instance, chapter 48 of [53]).

Chapter 48

An Introduction to the Standard
Model

The theory of fundamental particles and their non-gravitational interactions
is encapsulated by an extremely successful quantum ﬁeld theory known as the
Standard Model. This quantum ﬁeld theory is determined by a particular set
of quantum ﬁelds and a particular Hamiltonian, which we will outline in this
chapter. It is an interacting quantum ﬁeld theory, not solvable by the methods
we have seen so far. In the non-interacting approximation, it includes just the
sorts of free quantum ﬁeld theories that we have studied in earlier chapters.
This chapter gives only a very brief sketch of the deﬁnition of the theory; for
details, one needs to consult a conventional particle physics textbook.
After outlining the basic structures of the Standard Model, we will indicate the major issues that it does not address, issues that one might hope
will someday ﬁnd a resolution through a better understanding of the mathematical structures that underlie this particular example of a quantum ﬁeld
theory.

48.1 Non-Abelian gauge fields
The Standard Model includes gauge ﬁelds for a U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) gauge
group, with Hamiltonian given by the sum 46.10

The Ej and Bj take values in the Lie algebras u(1), su(2), su(3) for j =
1, 2, 3, respectively. trj indicates a choice of an adjoint-invariant inner product
for each of these Lie algebras, which could be deﬁned in terms of the trace in
some representation. Such an invariant inner product is unique up to a choice

of normalization, and this introduces three parameters into the theory, which
we will call g1 , g2 , g3 .
Some method must be found to deal appropriately with the gaugeinvariance problems associated with quantization of gauge ﬁelds discussed in
section 46.6. Interacting non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld theory remains incompletely
understood outside of perturbation theory. The theory of interacting quantum ﬁelds shows that, to get a well-deﬁned theory, one should think of the
parameters gj as being dependent on the distance scale at which the physics
is being probed, and one can calculate the form of this scale-dependence. The
SU (2) and SU (3) gauge ﬁeld dynamics is “asymptotically free,” meaning that
g2 , g3 can be deﬁned so as to go to zero at short-distance scales, with behavior of the theory approaching that of a free ﬁeld theory. This indicates that
one should be able to consistently remove short-distance cutoﬀs necessary to
deﬁne the theory, at least for those two terms in the Hamiltonian.

48.2 Fundamental fermions
The Standard Model includes both left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinor
ﬁelds, each coming in multiple copies and transforming under the U (1) ×
SU (2) × SU (3) group according to a very speciﬁc choice of representations.
They are described by the following terms in the Hamiltonian


Here the left-handed fermions take values in three copies (called “generations”) of the representation
1
(−1 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 1) ⊕ ( ⊗ 2 ⊗ 3)
3
while the right-handed fermions use three copies of
2
4

with the ﬁrst term in each tensor product giving the representation of U (1)
(the fractions indicate a cover is needed), the second the representation of
SU (2), the third the representation of SU (3). 1 is the trivial representation,
2 the deﬁning representation for SU (2), 3 that for SU (3).
The AR and AR are vector potential ﬁelds acting by the representations
given above, scaled by a constant gj corresponding to the appropriate term
in the gauge group.

48.3

Spontaneous symmetry breaking

623

48.3 Spontaneous symmetry breaking
The Higgs ﬁeld is an R4 -valued scalar ﬁeld, with a complex structure chosen
so that it can be taken to be C2 -valued Φ(x), with U (1) and SU (2) acting
by the deﬁning representations. The Hamiltonian is

(|Π|2 + |(∇ − iA)Φ|2 − m2 |Φ|2 + λ|Φ|4 )d3 x
hHiggs =
R3

where A are vector potential ﬁelds for U (1) ⊗ SU (2) acting in the deﬁning
representation, scaled by the coeﬃcients g1 , g2 .
Note the unusual sign of the mass term and the existence of a quartic
term. This means that the dynamics of such a theory cannot be analyzed
by the methods we have used so far. Thinking of the mass term and quartic
term as a potential energy for the ﬁeld, for constant ﬁelds this will have
a minimum at some nonzero values of the ﬁeld. To analyze the physics, one
shifts the ﬁeld Φ by such a value, and approximates the theory by a quadratic
expansion of the potential energy about that point. Such a theory will have
states corresponding to a new scalar particle (the Higgs particle) but will also
require a new analysis of the gauge symmetry, since gauge transformations
act non-trivially on the space of minima of the potential energy. For how
this “Anderson–Higgs mechanism” aﬀects the physics, one should consult a
standard textbook.
Finally, the Higgs ﬁeld and the spinor ﬁelds are coupled by cubic terms
called Yukawa terms, of a general form such as

M ΦΨ† Ψd3 x
hY ukawa =
R3

where Ψ, Ψ† are the spinor ﬁelds, Φ the Higgs ﬁeld, and M a complicated
matrix. When one expresses this in terms of the shifted Higgs ﬁeld, the constant term in the shift gives terms quadratic in the fermion ﬁelds. These
determine the masses of the spin 12 particles as well as the so-called “mixing
angles” that appear in the coupling of these particles to the gauge ﬁelds.

48.4 Unanswered questions and
speculative extensions
While the Standard Model has been hugely successful, with no conﬂicting
experimental evidence yet found, it is not a fully satisfactory theory, leaving
unanswered a short list of questions that one would expect a fundamental
theory to address. These are:

624

48 An Introduction to the Standard Model

48.4.1 Why these gauge groups and couplings?
We have seen that the theory has a U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) gauge group acting on it, and this motivates the introduction of gauge ﬁelds that take values
in the Lie algebra of this group. An obvious question is that of why this precise pattern of groups appears. When one introduces the Hamiltonian 48.1
for these gauge ﬁelds, one gets three diﬀerent coupling constants g1 , g2 , g3 .
Why do these have their measured values? Such coupling constants should be
thought of as energy-scale dependent, and one of them (g1 ) is not asymptotically free, raising the question of whether there is a short-distance problem
with the deﬁnition of this part of the theory.
One attempt to answer these questions is the idea of a “Grand Uniﬁed
Theory (GUT),” based on a large Lie group that includes U (1) × SU (2) ×
SU (3) as subgroups (typical examples are SU (5) and SO(10)). The question
of “why this group?” remains, but in principle, one now only has one coupling
constant instead of three. A major problem with this idea is that it requires
introduction of some new ﬁelds (a new set of Higgs ﬁelds), with dynamics
designed to leave a low-energy U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) gauge symmetry. This
introduces a new set of problems in place of the original one of the three
coupling constants.

48.4.2 Why these representations?
We saw in section 48.2 that the fundamental left- and right-handed spin
1
2 fermionic ﬁelds carry speciﬁc representations under the U (1) × SU (2) ×
SU (3) gauge group. We would like some sort of explanation for this particular pattern. An additional question is whether there is a fundamental
right-handed neutrino, with the gauge groups acting trivially on it. Such a
ﬁeld would have quanta that do not directly interact with the known nongravitational forces.
The strongest argument for the SO(10) GUT scenario is that a distinguished representation of this group, the 16-dimensional spinor representation, restricts on the U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) ⊂ SO(10) subgroup to precisely
the representation corresponding to a single generation of fundamental fermions (including the right-handed neutrino as a trivial representation).

48.4.3 Why three generations?
The pattern of fundamental fermions occurs with a three-fold multiplicity,
the “generations.” Why three? In principle, there could be other generations,

Unanswered questions and speculative extensions

but these would have to have all their particles at masses too high to have
been observed, including their neutrinos. These would be quite diﬀerent from
the known three generations, where the neutrino masses are light.

48.4.4 Why the Higgs field?
As described in section 48.3, the Higgs ﬁeld is an elementary scalar ﬁeld,
transforming as the standard C2 representation of the U (1) × SU (2) part of
the gauge group. As a scalar ﬁeld, it has quite diﬀerent properties and presumably a diﬀerent origin than that of fundamental fermion and gauge ﬁelds, but
what this might be remains a mystery. Besides the coupling to gauge ﬁelds,
its dynamics is determined by its potential function, which depends on two
parameters. Why do these have their measured values?

48.4.5 Why the Yukawas?
The fundamental fermion masses and mixing angles in the Standard Model
are determined by Yukawa terms in the Hamiltonian coupling the Higgs ﬁeld
to the fermions. These terms involve matrices with a signiﬁcant number of
parameters and the origin of these parameters is unknown. This is related to
the mystery of the Higgs ﬁeld itself, with our understanding of the nature of
the Higgs ﬁeld not able to constrain these parameters.

48.4.6 What is the dynamics of the gravitational
field?
Our understanding of gravitational forces in classical physics is based on Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which has fundamental degrees of freedom
that describe the geometry of space–time (which is no longer just Minkowski
space–time). These degrees of freedom can be chosen so as to include a connection (called the “spin connection”) and its curvature, much like the connection variables of gauge theory. The ﬁelds of the Standard Model can be
consistently coupled to the space–time geometry by a minimal coupling prescription using the spin connection. The Hamiltonian with Einstein’s equations as equations of motion is, however, not of the Yang–Mills form. Applying
standard perturbation theory and renormalization methods to this Hamiltonian leads to problems with deﬁning the theory (it is not asymptotically
free). There are a number of proposals for how to deal with this problem and

none so far have any compelling evidence in their favor.

relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory.

Further Topics

There is a long list of other topics that belong in a more complete discussion
of the general subject of this volume. Some of these are standard topics which
are well covered in many physics or mathematics textbooks. In this chapter,
We will just give a short list of some of the most important things that have
been left out.
Several of these have to do with quantum ﬁeld theory:
• Lower-dimensional quantum field theories. The simplest examples
of quantum ﬁeld theories are those with just one dimension of space
(and one dimension of time, so often described as “1 + 1”-dimensional).
While it would have been pedagogically a good idea to ﬁrst examine in
detail this case, keeping the length of this volume under control led to
the decision to not take the time to do this, but to directly go to the
physical case of “3 +1”-dimensional theories. The case of two spatial
dimensions is another lower-dimensional case with simpler behavior than
the physical case.
• Topological quantum field theories. One can also formulate quantum ﬁeld theories on arbitrary manifolds. An important class of such
quantum ﬁeld theories has Hamiltonian H = 0 and observables that
only depend on the topology of the manifold. The observables of such
“topological quantum ﬁeld theories” provide new sorts of topological
invariants of manifolds, and such theories are actively studied by mathematicians and physicists. We have already mentioned a simple supersymmetrical quantum mechanical model of this kind in section 33.3.

49 Further Topics

49.1 Connecting quantum theories
to experimental results
Our emphasis has been on the fundamental mathematical structures that
occur in quantum theory, but using these to derive results that can be compared to real-world experiments requires additional techniques. Such techniques are the main topics of typical standard physics textbooks dealing
with quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory. Among the most important are:
• Scattering theory. In the usual single-particle quantum mechanics,
one can study solutions to the Schrödinger equation that in the far
past and future correspond to free particle solutions, while interacting
with a potential at some intermediate ﬁnite times. This corresponds to
the situation analyzed experimentally through the study of scattering
processes.
In quantum ﬁeld theory, one generalizes this to the case of “inelastic
scattering,” where particles are being produced as well as scattered.
Such calculations are of central importance in high energy physics, where
most experimental results come from colliding accelerated particles and
studying these sorts of scattering and particle production processes.
• Perturbation methods. Rarely can one ﬁnd exact solutions to quantum mechanical problems, so one needs to have at hand an array of
approximation techniques. The most important is perturbation theory,
the study of how to construct series expansions about exact solutions.
This technique can be applied to a wide variety of situations, as long as
the system in question is not too dramatically of a diﬀerent nature than
one for which an exact solution exists. In practice, this means that one
studies in this manner Hamiltonians that consist of a quadratic term
(and thus exactly solvable by the methods we have discussed) plus a
higher-order term multiplied by a small parameter λ. Various methods
are available to compute the terms in a power series solution of the theory about λ = 0, and such calculational methods are an important topic
of most quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks.

49.2 Other important mathematical
physics topics
There are quite a few important mathematical topics which go beyond those
discussed here, but which have signiﬁcant connections to fundamental physical theories. These include:

49.2

Other important mathematical physics topics

629

• Higher rank simple Lie groups. The representation theory of groups
like SU (3) has many applications in physics, and is also a standard topic
in the graduate-level mathematics curriculum, part of the general theory of ﬁnite dimensional representations of semi-simple Lie groups and
Lie algebras. This theory uses various techniques to reduce the problem
to the cases of SU (2) and U (1) that we have studied. Historically, the
recognition of the approximate SU (3) symmetry of the strong interactions (because of the relatively light masses of the up, down, and strange
quarks) led to the ﬁrst widespread use of more sophisticated representation theory techniques in the physics community.
• Euclidean methods. Quantum ﬁeld theories, especially in the path
integral formalism, are analytically best behaved in Euclidean rather
than Minkowski space–time signature. Analytic continuation methods
can then be used to extract the Minkowski space behavior from the
Euclidean space formulation of the theory. Such analytic continuation
methods, using a complexiﬁcation of the Lorentz group, can be used to
understand some very general properties of relativistic quantum ﬁeld
theories, including the spin-statistics and CPT theorems.
• Conformal geometry and the conformal group. For theories of
massless particles, it is useful to study the group SU (2, 2) that acts on
Minkowski space by conformal transformations, with the Poincaré group
as a subgroup. The complexiﬁcation of this is the group SL(4, C). The
complexiﬁcation of (conformally compactiﬁed) Minkowski space turns
out to be a well-known mathematical object, the Grassmannian manifold
of complex two-dimensional subspaces of C4 . The theory of twistors
exploits this sort of geometry of C4 , with spinor ﬁelds appearing in a
“tautological” manner: a point of space–time is a C2 ⊂ C4 , and the
spinor ﬁeld takes values in that C2 .
• Infinite dimensional groups. We have seen that inﬁnite dimensional
gauge groups play an important role in physics, but unfortunately the
representation theory of such groups is poorly understood. Much is
known if one takes space to be one-dimensional. For periodic boundary
conditions, such one-dimensional gauge groups are loop groups, groups
of maps from the circle to a ﬁnite dimensional Lie group G. The Lie
algebras of such groups are called aﬃne Lie algebras, and their representation theory can be studied by a combination of relatively conventional mathematical methods and quantum ﬁeld theory methods, with
the anomaly phenomenon playing a crucial role. The inﬁnite dimensional
group of diﬀeomorphisms of the circle and its Lie algebra (the Virasoro algebra) also play a role in this context. From the two-dimensional
space–time point of view, many such theories have an inﬁnite dimensional group action corresponding to conformal transformations of the
space–time. The study of such conformal ﬁeld theories is an important
topic in mathematical physics, with representation theory methods a
central part of that subject.

Bilinear forms

Parentheses

will be used for a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form (inner product) on

will be used for non-degenerate symmetric sesquilinear forms (Hermitian
inner products) on vector spaces Cn . These are antilinear in the ﬁrst entry
and linear in the second. When the inner product is positive, it will be preserved by the group U (n), but the indeﬁnite case with n = 2d and group
U (d, d) will also occur. The quantum mechanical state space comes with such
a positive Hermitian inner product, but may be inﬁnite dimensional and a
Hilbert space.
Non-degenerate antisymmetric forms (symplectic forms) will be denoted by

Symplectic geometry
and quantization

The Lie bracket on the space of functions on phase space M is given by the
Poisson bracket, determined by
{q, p} = 1
Quantization takes 1, q, p to self-adjoint operators 1, Q, P . To make this a
unitary representation of the Heisenberg Lie algebra h3 , multiply the selfadjoint operators by −i, so they satisfy
[−iQ, −iP ] = −i1, or [Q, P ] = i1
In other words, our quantization map is the unitary representation of h3 that
satisﬁes
Γ (q) = −iQ, Γ (p) = −iP, Γ (1) = −i1
Dynamics is determined classically by the Hamiltonian function h as follows
d
f = {f, h}

After quantization, this becomes the equation
d
O(t) = [O, −iH]

for the dynamics of Heisenberg picture operators, which implies
O(t) = eitH Oe−itH
where O is the Schrödinger picture operator. In the Schrödinger picture,
states evolve according to the Schrödinger equation

If a group G acts on a space M , the representation one gets on functions
on M is given by
π(g)(f (x)) = f (g −1 · x)
Examples include
• Space translation (q → q + a). On states, one has

which in the Schrödinger representation is
e−ia(−i dq ) ψ(q) = e−a dq ψ(q) = ψ(q − a)

So, the Lie algebra action is given by the operator −iP = − dq

• The classical expressions for angular momentum quadratic in qj , pj , for

We deﬁne complex coordinates on phase space by

J0 zj = izj , J0 z j = −iz j
−
so the zj are a basis of M+
J0 , the z j of MJ0 . They have Poisson brackets

{zj , z k } = iδjk
In the Bargmann–Fock quantization, the state space is taken to be polynomials in the zj , with annihilation and creation operators

Special relativity

The “mostly plus” convention for the Minkowski inner product is used, so
four-vectors x = (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) satisfy
(x, x) = ||x||2 = −x20 + x21 + x22 + x23
The relativistic energy–momentum relation is then
p2 = −E 2 + ||p||2 = −m2

A.6

Cliﬀord algebras and spinors

The Cliﬀord algebra associated with an inner product (·, ·) satisﬁes the relation
uv + vu = 2(u, v)
With the choice of signature for the Minkowski inner product above, the
Cliﬀord algebra is isomorphic to a real matrix algebra
Cliﬀ(3, 1) = M (4, R)
Under this isomorphism, basis elements of Minkowski space correspond to γ
matrices, which satisfy
γ02 = −1, γ12 = γ22 = γ32 = 1
Explicit choices of these matrices are described in sections 41.2, 47.2, and
47.3.
The Dirac equation is taken to be
(∂/ − m)ψ(x) = 0

Consider the group S3 of permutations of 3 objects. This group acts on the
set of 3 elements. Consider the representation (π, C3 ) this gives on the vector

Show that, just as SO(4) has a double cover Spin(4) = Sp(1) × Sp(1), the
