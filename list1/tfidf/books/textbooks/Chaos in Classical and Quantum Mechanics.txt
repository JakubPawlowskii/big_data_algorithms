Faithful Companions on a Long Journey

Preface

Elementary mechanics, both classical and quantum, has become a
growth industry in the last decade. A newcomer to this flourishing field
must get acquainted with some unfamiliar concepts and get rid of some
cherished assumptions. The change in orientation is necessary because
physicists have finally realized that most dynamical systems do not
follow simple, regular, and predictable patterns, but run along a seemingly random, yet well-defined, trajectory. The generally accepted
name for this phenomenon is chaos, a term that accurately suggests that
we have failed to come to grips with the problem.
This book offers a collection of ideas and examples rather than
general concepts and mathematical theorems. However, an indifferent
compilation of the most telling results can only discourage the novice.
In order to focus on a central theme, I have singled out the questions
that have a bearing on the connection between classical and quantum
mechanics. In this manner we are led to ask whether there are chaotic
features in quantum mechanics; the issue is still open, and all the preliminary answers suggest that quantum mechanics is more subtle than
most of us had realized.
Reading this book requires a knowledge of both classical and
quantum mechanics beyond a first introductory physics course. Advanced mastery of these subjects is not necessary, however, and probably not even desirable, since I am trying to appeal to the intuition
rather than the analytical ability of the reader. Some of the more sophisticated concepts, such as the action function in classical mechanics
and its analog in quantum mechanics, Green's function, are basic to the

vm

Preface

whole development as it is presented here. Their meaning and their use
will be explained in the context in which they appear, and without the
mathematical qualifications that would be necessary if I tried to offer
general propositions rather than special cases.
In keeping with this informal style I have emphasized certain aspects of the whole story which are not usually found in scientific books.
Whenever possible I base my arguments on elementary geometry rather
than algebraic manipulations. In order to gain a better perspective on
the more important results, references to the historical development
are often helpful. In the same vein, related problems from different
disciplines are mentioned in the same section, with particular attention
to mathematics, astronomy, physics, and chemistry. Finally, I have
taken the liberty to comment on the motivation behind certain efforts,
to evaluate the validity and relevance of some results, and to consider
future tasks, if not to speculate outright about possible developments
in the field of chaos.
This book comes out of a course of the same title that I taught in the
winter and spring of 1986 at the Laboratoire de Physique du Solide in
Orsay, outside of Paris. I owe a debt of gratitude to my faithful audience, who helped me with a moderate amount of criticism; in particular, Francoise Axel, Oriol Bohigas, Alain Comtet, Marie Joya
Giannoni, Bernard Jancovici, Maurice Kleman, Jean Marc Luck,
Claude Itzykson, and Andre Voros provided many useful suggestions.
Most scientists have not participated in the recent development of
ideas related to chaos in Hamiltonian systems; they are usually not
aware of the many different viewpoints and interpretations, the new
problems and methods for their solution, and the novel applications to
important experiments. As far as this book is concerned, all of these
ideas deal with relatively elementary questions in both classical and
quantum mechanics; as soon as they are understood, some readers may
be tempted to call them obvious because of their deceptive simplicity!
Since I have worked in this area for twenty years, I have benefitted
from discussions with many colleagues who are interested in questions
related to chaos. I want to thank them all, and apologize for not mentioning them by name. It is remarkable how many different personalities and individual tastes in scientific matters can be attracted to one
central theme. I hope indeed that this book will appeal to all those who
look for diversity in their pursuit of physics and its closest relatives,
mathematics, astronomy, and chemistry. Thus we might eventually
find harmony in chaos.

Introduction

Elementary mechanics is the model for the physical sciences. Its principles and methods are the ideal for most other disciplines that deal
with nature. Substantial parts even of mathematics have been developed to deal with the problems of mechanics. Every scientist has a
fairly well-defined picture of the way mechanics works and the kind
of results it yields.
According to the prevailing views, a dynamical system runs along a
predictable and regular course, and ends up in some periodic and steady
state. If very many particles are involved and we are either unable or
unwilling to follow each one individually, then we are satisfied with
knowing the statistical properties of a dynamical system. The phenomena of thermodynamics, of friction, and of diffusion have a probabilistic character because we don't really need to know everything
there is. The situation is subject to random processes because we
choose to be ignorant. By contrast, the mechanical behavior of simple
systems is assumed to be entirely comprehensible, easily described,
perhaps even dull.
This erroneous impression is created by the special examples discussed in school, from elementary to graduate: two bodies attracting
each other with an inverse-square-of-the-distance force, as in planetary motion and in the hydrogen atom; several oscillators coupled by
linear springs; and a rotating symmetric rigid body in a uniform
gravitational field, the gyroscope. The general methods for solving
more difficult problems are presented as technical refinements best left

Introduction

to the experts -- astronomers working in celestial mechanics and theoreticians in atomic and molecular physics.
A century ago mathematicians discovered that some apparently
simple mechanical systems can have very complicated motions. Not
only is their behavior exceedingly sensitive to the precise starting conditions, but they never settle to any reasonable final state with a recognizable fixed pattern. Although their movements look smooth over
short times, they seem to jump unpredictably and indefinitely when
their positions and momenta are checked over large time intervals.
Astronomers became increasingly aware of this problem during the
last 60 years, but physicists began to recognize it only some 20 years
ago. The phenomenon, which now goes under the name chaos, has
since become a very fashionable topic of investigation. Innocent
onlookers might suspect one more passing fad. I do not think it will
turn out that way, though. Chaos is not only here to stay, but will
challenge many of our assumptions about the typical behavior of dynamical systems. Since mechanics underlies our view of nature, we will
probably have to modify some of our ideas concerning the harmony
and beauty of the universe.
As a first step, we will have to study entirely different basic examples in order to re-form our intuition. We must become familiar with
certain novel specimens of simple mechanical systems based on chaotic
rather than regular behavior. General abstract propositions do not
serve that purpose, although they are desirable once we become
knowledgeable about the issues involved.
This book is, therefore, committed to the discussion of specific examples, in particular the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, the donor
impurity in a semiconductor where the effective mass of the electron
is different in different directions, and the motion of a particle on a
surface of negative curvature. Other equally instructive systems, which
are chaotic, yet simple enough to be understood thoroughly, will be
mentioned without detailed discussion. Among them is the hydrogen
atom in a strong microwave field; an adequate treatment would almost
require a monograph by itself, if the recent experiments on this system
are to be presented, and everything put into proper perspective.
These unfamiliar examples must be seen in full contrast with the
familiar ones. A discussion of the regular behavior and of some
borderline systems will therefore precede the main part of this book.
In particular the three-body problem of celestial mechanics will be discussed in some detail with special attention to the Moon-Earth-Sun
system. The important ideas of classical mechanics were first conceived and tested in this area, and their practical application can be

observed in the sky without elaborate instruments. Chaos made its first
appearance there.
Mathematicians have put a lot of effort into proving the formal
equivalence between various abstract dynamical systems. Although
one hopes that these endeavors will ultimately embrace all mechanical
systems, the different kinds of chaotic behavior have not been characterized to the point where an exhaustive classification can be attempted. The study of further examples will eventually get us there.
Meanwhile some simple practical distinctions are sufficient. I see no
reason to split the phenomenon into more than two broad categories:
soft chaos, which allows an approach starting from regular behavior by
perturbation or breaking the symmetry as it were, and hard chaos,
where each trajectory is isolated as the intersection of a stable and an
unstable manifold. Such general features as bound states versus scattering, or conservative versus time-dependent forces remain important;
but there will be no discussion of friction, nor of any other dissipation of
energy.
Only systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom will be
considered. This selection is dictated by a fundamental problem on
which I have worked for two decades and which serves as the focus in
this book: How can the classical mechanics of Newton, Euler, and
Lagrange be understood as a limiting case within the quantum mechanics of Heisenberg, Schroedinger, and Dirac? Einstein in 1917 was
the first, and for 40 years the only, scientist to point out the true dimensions of this problem when the classical dynamical system is chaotic. While we are still a long way from a satisfactory answer, I can
think of no better issue to guide our thinking.
In this manner we are led straight into the main question of quantum
chaos: Is there anything within quantum mechanics to compare with
the chaotic behavior of classical dynamical systems? It seems unlikely,
although there are cases of smooth chaos in quantum mechanics which
border on the enigmatic, e.g., the scattering of waves on a twodimensional box. Their discussion requires a certain degree of mathematical sophistication which is well worth the effort.
Mechanics, classical as well as quantal, with all the above restrictions in the choice of examples, seems almost simple enough to be
within the grasp of purely algebraic and analytical methods. There are,
however, striking examples where numerical calculations have given the
investigator clues to the analytical solution of a problem. Furthermore,
the ready availability of computers has led to many interesting numerical results, with as many intuitive interpretations, all in need of further
sorting to find the relevant ideas. A somewhat arbitrary choice among
these computational efforts is almost inevitable, particularly in view of

4

Introduction

the rapid accumulation of partial results. I have tried to concentrate
on the work which tests the limit toward classical mechanics, and which
is not the subject of some recent monograph, such as, for instance, the
hydrogen atom in a microwave field, one of the few cases of quantum
chaos with a wealth of experimental material.
Some readers may be disappointed because they do not find a satisfactory account of what interests them most. The number of articles
in this general area has become overwhelming in the last decade. Since
I think that new examples are of the essence, I regret that some particularly interesting ones are not dicussed here.
Among the most serious omissions I want to mention specifically
almost everything connected with time-dependent Hamiltonian systems such as the hydrogen-atom in a strong microwave field (Bayfield
and Koch 1974, for a review cf. Bayfield 1987) as well as the closely
related kicked rotator (Casati, Chirikov, Izraelev, and Ford 1979;
Fishman, Grempel, and Prange 1982, 1984). Discrete maps and their
quantum analog get very little attention (Balazs and Voros 1989), and
almost nothing is said about rotating bodies like gyroscopes and coupled
spins (Magyari, Thomas, Weber, Kaufmann, and Muller 1987;
Srivastava et al. 1988), nor about related work in nuclear physics
(Meredith, Koonin, and Zirnbauer 1988; Swiatecki 1988). The above
references are supposed to point to some of the seminal work in one
of these areas.
Every author is entitled to use the lack of space as an excuse, although a lack of competence, interest, and/ or hard work in certain
subjects might occasionally provide a more adequate explanation for
some shortcomings. Such obvious reasons, however, are based on the
author's personal preferences and his perspective on the whole enterprise of theoretical physics. They are not easily condensed into simple
declarations of intent, or statements explaining general views and
methods, because they are always intimately mixed with the author's
personal and professional experiences. The organization of this book
and the choice of the several topics has to be seen as one possible, and
to some extent coherent, approach to a novel and very active area in
science.

CHAPTER 1

The Mechanic s of Lagrange

The most general starting point for the discussion of any mechanical
system is the variational principle. It was first proposed as a particularly
concise formulation of Newton's laws of motion, and it turns out to be
extremely useful for some simple manipulations such as the transition
between different coordinate systems. Feynman (1948, 1965), with
the inspiration of Dirac (1933, 1935), then found a complete analog
for it in quantum mechanics. Indeed, the path integral provides the most
direct link between the classical and the quantum regime (cf. Section
13.4).
The ideas concerning the variational principle of Lagrange are the
backbone of this whole book. They will be explained in general terms
assuming that the reader has met them before; they will also be illustrated explicitly using the example of space travel in the solar system.
The titles of this chapter and the next one are somewhat misleading.
The historical development of mechanics is more complicated than the
simple division into two kinds of mechanics, Lagrange's depending on
time as the primary parameter, and Hamilton-Jacobi's depending on
the energy. This distinction is important in quantum mechanics, however, and since our presentation is skewed in that direction, the relevant
differences are brought out already at the classical level. The first two
chapters are not meant to trace the origin of all the ideas back to their
authors except where this is specifically mentioned.

The Mechanics of Lagrange

1.1 Newton's Equations According to Lagrange
Let us think of the mechanical system to be studied as described at any
fixed instant of time t by the collection of the position coordinates,
q = (qJ, qz, ... , qn), and the collection of the velocity components,
q = (qJ, qz, ... , iJn), which are needed for a complete specification. We
call q simply the position of the system, and the vector q its velocity.
The number n of coordinates is called the number of degrees of freedom
for the system. We will usually deal with n = 2 because that is the
smallest for a system to be chaotic when its energy is conserved.
The variational principle is formulated with the help of a function
L, called the Lagrangian, which depends on the position q, the velocity
q, and the time t, L(q, q, t). The most common form for L, and the
only one to be used in this book, is deceptively simple: it is the difference L = T - V of the kinetic energy T and the potential energy V.
The kinetic energy Tis the product of half the mass, m/2, times the
square of the velocity, which we will write simply as q2 • Only when the
particle is moving in a (Euclidean) plane and we are using Cartesian
coordinates, can we write q2 = q1 2 + q2 2 ; when the motion takes place

metric, as we will explain when the time comes.

factor m, the mass. It is one of Newton's glories to have postulated the
relation jJ =force, rather than m ij =force, which one finds in most
elementary textbooks and many advanced presentations by mathematicians. Although Newton did not know at the time, his formulation
correctly includes the motion of a charged particle in the presence of a
magnetic field, the trajectory of a rocket whose mass decreases as it
accelerates, and the motion of a particle close to the speed of light as
in high-energy physics. (In modern mathematical parlance p is a cotangent on the manifold described by the coordinates q.)

This formula combines the two preceding relations (1.1) and (1.2) in
our special case L = T - V, but it has general validity even in the situations of which neither Newton nor Lagrange were aware. The author
admits cheerfully that he does not have a good intuitive grasp of the
Lagrange formalism as expressed in the Lagrangian L = T - V and
the equations of motion (1.3), although they are undoubtedly the
foundation of physics. The next section may convey a better idea why
the Lagrangian is the difference between the kinetic and potential energy; mechanics manages somehow to reduce this difference after averaging over a given time interval.

1.2 The Variational Principle of Lagrange
Before proceeding to the main topic of this section, we introduce three
terms that will occur very frequently and have to be carefully distinguished. Although customary usage is not well defined for these terms,
and the present assignment may seem arbitrary, it is helpful to pin
down their meaning for the purpose of this book.
A path in the mechanical system is an arbitrary, continuous function
q( T) where the real variable T varies from the initial value t' to the final
value t", i.e., t' ~ T ~ t". We call the initial value q(t') = q' and the
final value q(t") = q' 1 • The functions qi( T), which describe the path of
the system, are assumed sufficiently smooth so as to give us no trouble
in the mathematical manipulations. A tremendous variety of such
paths is usually available, even for the most intricate choice of the ini. 1 an d f"ma1 va1ues, t,I .tff , qI , an d q ff .
tla
A trajectory of the mechanical system from the position q' at time t'
to the position q" at time t" is a solution q(t) of the equations of motion
( 1.1) with the time tin the interval (t', 111 ) and the stipulated initial and

8

The Mechanics of Lagrange

final values, q(t') = q' and q(t") = q". Such a solution may not exist
if we choose the values t', t", q', and q" awkwardly. On the other hand,
there may be several or even infinitely many such solutions, although
they are probably not easy to get explicitly.
A periodic orbit, occasionally abbreviated to orbit, is a trajectory
whose final position and momentum coordinates q" and p" coincide
with the initial position and momentum coordinates q' and p' so that

smoothly like a Kepler ellipse. Quite unexpectedly, even a mechanical
system with the worst kind of chaos has a dense set of periodic orbits.
They play a critical role in the transition from classical to quantum
mechanics.
The trajectories are the essence of classical mechanics. Every dynamical system runs along a trajectory; the only choice in the matter
concerns the initial and final values, getting from here q' at this time t'
to there q" at that timet". In quantum mechanics, however, all possible paths contribute to the transfer of the system from q' to q" in the
time interval from t' to t''. The result of all these possibilities is a
superposition of little wavelets, each associated with one of the paths.
Needless to say, the relevant calculation is even more difficult than
finding the classical trajectories.
The variational principle can now be formulated as follows: Given
the initial values (q', t') and the final values (q", t") together with a
trajectory q0 (t) from here to there, look at all the neighboring paths
whose position coordinates q( -r) are obtained by adding a function
~q( -r), called a displacement, to the coordinates q0 ( T) so that
q(-r) = q0 (-r) + ~q(-r). Then calculate the integral of L(q, q, -r) overT
from t' to t". The value of this integral depends on the particular choice
of the function ~q(-r); it can be expanded in powers of ~q(-r), always
assuming that there is no analytical trouble with the chosen functions.
The three first terms of this expansion are needed; they have special
names, which will come up over and over again.
The lowest term depends only on the trajectory q0 (t) because it is
obtained by setting ~q( T) = 0. It is called Hamilton's principal function
(HPF), or somewhat indiscriminately,
the action
integral
R (q", t"; q', t') from (q', t') to (q", t") along the trajectory q0 (t). As
a formula,
R(q", t"; q', t') =

d-r L(q0 , q0 , -r).

(1.4)

The simplest example of R comes from a particle moving freely in
(Euclidean) space. Its trajectories are straight lines, so in order to get
from q' to q" we have to draw the straight line connecting these two

1.2 The Variational Principle of Lagrange

points. The velocity of the particle is the distance divided by the allowed time t" - t', and the kinetic energy T is half the mass times the
velocity squared. Since Tis the same along the entire trajectory, the
integration over time simply multiplies with t" - t'; therefore, we have
in Cartesian coordinates for q, the formula
m (q" -q')2
(1.5)
R (q" ' t" 'q'
· ' t') '
2(1'' - t)
The next term in the expansion is called the first variation and is
designated with the symbol ofdT L. The variational principle demands
that the first variation vanish for any path which has the same initial and
final values as the trajectory q0 (t), or in other words, has a displacement
such that oq(t') = oq(t") = 0. This principle is usually expressed by
the formula

of

t"

t'

dT L(q, q, T) = 0.

(1.6)

This condition on the first variation of the integral over L can be
reduced to the equation (1.3). The detailed argument for this conclusion can be found in every textbook on mechanics or on the calculus
of variation (cf. Whittaker 1904 and 1944; Courant and Hilbert 1924
and 1953; Caratheodory 1935; Goldstein 1950; Landau and Lifschitz
19 57; Arnold 197 8). The history of the variational principle is more
complicated than is generally realized, and shows that the principle is
not nearly as easy to understand intuitively as its formal statement.
Euler ( 17 44) and Maupertuis ( 17 44, 17 46) gave the first valid proposition of this type in the history of mechanics (cf. Section 2.3); but it
differed significantly from (1.6), and does not have a simple connection with Feynman's path integral (cf. the end of Chapter 13). The
full impact on mechanics was pointed out to them some sixteen years
later by the younger Lagrange (1760); but even he did not use what
we call today the Lagrangian, nor did he go beyond his two predecessors to arrive at (1.6). That feat was left to Hamilton (1834, 1835)
some 75 years later, who deserves the credit for using the function
L = T - V, and deducing (1.3) from (1.6).
Jacobi (1842) was the first to offer definite conclusions as to the
mathematical meaning of the condition (1.6). Even today, most scientists speak carelessly about the integral over L being a minimum, or
they phrase their thoughts more cautiously by talking only about an
extremum without any precise idea how to decide whether the trajectory is indeed minimal, maximal, or something in between. This issue
is of central importance when we try to make the hazardous transition
from classical to quantum mechanics. It requires the third term in the

10

The Mechanics of Lagrange

expansion, the so-called second variation, which will be discussed at
the end of this chapter. Meanwhile we will try to put the action integral
(HPF) itself into better perspective.

1.3 Conservation of Energy
Most of the dynamical systems we will study in this book 'conserve
their energy', an expression that needs to be defined in this context.
In terms of the Lagrangian L, conservation of energy comes about when
L does not depend explicitly on the time variable t; the position and the
velocity of the system determines the same value of L whatever the
time happens to be. As a consequence, the quantity
E =

Lqj
a~ - L
j
dqj

(1.7)

stays constant along any trajectory, as is shown in any standard textbook with relatively few manipulations. A further, almost trivial calculation in the case where L = T- V, and T = mq2 /2, shows that
E = T + V, the sum of kinetic and potential energy, just what we
would call the total energy of the system.
As another consequence, when we calculate the action integral
(HPF), the precise timing of the initial and final state does not matter,
as long as the time interval t = t" - t' is kept the same. Thus we will
henceforth write simply R (q" q' t) instead of the previous
R (q", t"; q', t'). At the same time we simplify the writing by leaving

out the commas and the colons which serve as separators among the variables. The order of appearance in the list of variables is enough to

identify them. This convention will be used throughout this book as
long as there is no possible confusion.
A trajectory is usually defined in terms of its initial position q', its
final position q", and the total time t = t'' - t'; the action integral R is
written as if it were a function of exactly these quantities for a particular trajectory q0 ( T). What happens when q', q", or t are allowed to
vary? The first thing to make sure is that we still have a trajectory;
moreover we want the original trajectory to go continuously into the
new one. When these conditions are met, a number of tricky computations show that

These relations are sometimes expressed in the form of a differential
that reminds us of thermodynamics, namely
''~ '' -puq'~ '
E~t
(1.9)
u~R =puq
u.
The interpretation of this formula is straightforward: the use of
8q', 8q", and 8t on the right-hand side indicates that q', q", and tare
the natural variables for R; moreover, p'' is the partial derivative of R
with respect to q", and so on. We will sometimes make use of this notation. The classical work of Lagrange and Hamilton is mostly phrased
in formulas like (1.9), using virtual displacements, which seem to have
lost their intuitive appeal in our time.

You will get a short boost from a rocket at departure, and you will then
coast freely for six months. Most of the trip is made outside the
gravitational field of either Earth or Mars, so that it suffices for this
simple example to take into account only the gravitational attraction
of the Sun. Our first task is to find the appropriate trajectory, and then
we have to calculate the action integral R.
The known positions of the Earth in q' at the start and of Mars upon
arrival in q" determine a plane together with the central position of the
Sun. Choosing polar coordinates (r, <f>) in this plane with the Sun at the

(1.10)

where a is half the major axis of a Kepler ellipse, e its eccentricity, and
<Po the angle in the direction of the perihelion (closest approach to the
sun). The angle <f> - <Po is called the true anomaly because it gives the
true polar coordinate with respect to the perihelion; it does not increase
uniformly with time, however, and is not a convenient parameter in our
problem.
The eccentric anomaly u is the angle around the center of the trajectory in a special construction of the ellipse. In Cartesian coordinates
with the Sun at the origin, the trajectory is given by
x=a(cosu-e), y=aV1-e 2 sinu,

(1.11)

12

The Mechanics of Lagrange

if the x-axis lies along the major axis. The values of x, y, and u are
primed for the starting conditions, and double-primed for the arrival.
The time dependence of the eccentric anomaly is given by Kepler's
equation,
(1.12)
u - e sinu = n(t - t0 ) ,
where to is the time of perihelion passage, and the right-hand side is
called the mean anomaly. The mean motion n is the average angular
speed of our spacecraft if it were allowed to make a complete journey
around the Sun. It is given by Kepler's third law n 2a 3 = GM in terms
of the solar mass M and the gravitational constant G. (Kepler's third
law expresses the average balance between the centrifugal force m n 2a
and the gravitational force GMm/ a 2 .) The relation between the time
t and the eccentric anomaly u is transcendental, i.e., not algebraic, and
that is the principal difficulty in treating planetary motions analytically.
The problem of finding the parameters of the elliptic trajectory from
the known initial and final positions and times was solved by the
eighteenth-century all-round genius Lambert, after the usual preliminary work of Euler. We shall simply record the main steps in this remarkable result because it is not easy to find in any textbook (cf. Battin
1964); the reader may check the algebraic manipulations, which are
not difficult.
As a first step, angles a and f3 are defined by
u - u
u
u
) , f3 = " 2 '
cosa = e cos( '+"
2
which are then combined into new angles y and 8 through y = a + f3
and 8 = a - {3. If we write r = ((x" - x')2 + (y" - y')2) 112 for the
distance between the points of departure and arrival, the following relations are easy to check with the help of elementary geometry and
Kepler's equation (1.12):
(1.13a)
f.L = r' + r" + r = 4a sin 2 (y/2),
v = r' + r" - r = 4a sin 2 (8/2) ,

(1.13b)

/(fM (t" - t') = a 312 ((y- siny) + (8- sin8)) .

(1.13c)

These equations can be solved as long as the trajectory is indeed a
Kepler ellipse, rather than a parabola or hyperbola, because the righthand sides of (1.13a) and (1.13b) are then smaller than 4a by virtue
of the triangle inequality. The double sign in (1.13c) comes from
choosing the short ( - ) or the long ( +) elliptic arc connecting the
endpoints of our space trip.
The three equations (1.13) have three unknowns, y, 8, and a ; but
the first unknown can be eliminated by the simple expedient of writing

y - siny = 2arcsin~ - 2(1 - ~ 2 ) 112 for ~ = sin1..:dl.L and expanding
both arcsin and ( 1 - ~ 2 ) 112 in powers of ~ = / p./ 4a . A similar trick
is used for 11 = sin(8/2) = /v/4a . The necessary expansions are well

known; but before writing the result, it is natural to use the energy E
of the trajectory rather than its semimajor axis a; since
E = - GMm/2a, we use c = 1/2a = - E/GMm, where m is the mass
of our space cabin. Finally, the result of Lambert is the series

which converges like a binomial expansion because both p. and v are
smaller than 4a as noted above.
This marvelous formula can be better understood if we insert concrete numbers; it is natural to use the semimajor axis of the Earth's
orbit as the unit length, and the year as the unit of time; the mean motion of the Earth is then 2'1T/year, and Kepler's third law for the Earth
then says that
= 2'1T. If the semimajor axis a is infinite, i.e., the
trajectory is parabolic and its energy E = 0, then the formula ( 1.14)
has only the first term j = 1, and gives directly the time of travel in
years, t = (p.3/ 2 + v31 2)/12'1T. This is the special case of (1.14), which
Euler had already derived; it serves as the starting point for more realistic trajectories where E < 0 and c > 0. Since the coefficients in the
power series (1.14) are positive, the travel time increases
monotonically with increasing c, as one would expect as the trajectory
has less energy E. Given t" - t', and the distances p. and v, the necessary energy can be found by solving (1.14).
The whole calculation could have been carried out for hyperbolic
trajectories where E > 0 and therefore c < 0; the same formula ( 1.14)
is still valid, but the series is now alternating, and the travel time shorter
than for the parabolic orbit.
The action integral R is now calculated directly from its definition
( 1.4) with the Lagran ian L = T- V as given in the first section,
where V = - GMm/ (x 2 + y 2 ) . With the trajeetory (1.11) and
Kepler's equation (1.12) the integral over time is reduced to an elementary integral over the eccentric anomaly u, and then to the parameters y and 8. The result can be written as
R = ;

y and 8 can again be eliminated by the same trick as above; but the

14

semimajor axis a, or equivalently the energy E, has first to be found
from Lambert's equation (1.14 ).

1.5 The Second Variation
In trying to work out the second variation, all possible displacements
have to be presented in some practical form, such as an expansion in a
Fourier series over the time interval t,
oq( T)

(1.16)

The coefficients a1 are real, and we have chosen a sine series in order
to get the boundary conditions oq(O) = oq(t) = 0. The second variation consists of the second-order terms in the expansion of f dT L in
powers of oq( T); it is a quadratic function of the numbers a1 . The nature of the extremum around the trajectory q0 ( T) is entirely determined
by the character of this quadratic function. If it is positive definite,
we have indeed a minimum; otherwise, we have a more complicated
situation like a saddle-point.
This problem was first studied by Jacobi, mostly in the context of
geodesic lines on a two-dimensional surface. Marston Morse ( 1934)
in the 1920s and 1930s then came up with the definitive statements.
The nature of the extremum can be determined without explicitly calculating the quadratic function of the preceding paragraph. The answer depends on the trajectories in the neighborhood of q0 ( T). Since
they are given by solving the equation of motion ( 1.1) and their coordinates q( T) do not differ much from the trajectory q0 ( T ), it is natural
to write again q( T) = q0 ( T) + oq( T), and find the equations to be solved
by oq.
Let us take the simplest case where p = mq, and use Newton's
equation ( 1.2). The left-hand side is already linear in oq, but the righthand side has to be expanded in powers of oq. Only the lowest terms
are retained so that

where the so-called Einstein convention has been used: indices occurring
twice are to be summed unless specified otherwise. The second derivatives of the potential at the time T are evaluated by inserting for the
coordinates q the values q0 ( T ). In solving these ordinary linear differential equations we use the initial conditions oq(O) = 0, and

1.5 The Second Variation

15

m8q(O) = 8p', where 8p' are arbitrary numbers. The neighboring trajectories are thereby chosen to start in the same location q', but with
momenta different from p'. These neighboring trajectories form a fan
that spreads out as one moves away from the starting point.
This fan of trajectories is left to spread until the time t". The
endpoints differ from q" by an amount 8q". The starting deviations
8p', and the final deviations 8q" are vectors that are linearly related
through the formula 8q" = N 8p' where the matrix N is given by

N-I

•

Instead of the matrix N we have calculated its inverse M, which can be
expressed directly in terms of the second derivatives of the action integral R (q" q' t" - t') along the trajectory q0 ( 'T) with respect to the coordinates q' and q'' because of ( 1. 8). The matrix M and its determinant
will play an important role later on.
The fan of trajectories starts out with a regular matrix N, or equivalently, with a regular matrix M. Any system moves like a bunch of
free particles for the first few moments of its trajectory, provided that
the forces acting on it are finite. The formula (1.5) for R(q"q' t'' -t')
can, therefore, be used to calculate the matrix M, which becomes a
multiple of the unit matrix.
As the swarm of trajectories moves away from its starting point,
however, it may collapse occasionally; that happens when N becomes
singular. These unfortunate occurrences are isolated as the swarm
moves along, so that there is a sequence of times
0 < 'TJ :5 '~"2 :::; '~"3 :::; · · · when that happens. Usually, the rank of N gets
reduced by 1, and the next time N becomes singular is strictly later. But
sometimes the rank of N may be reduced by 2 at the same time; in that
case we insert two values in the series of'~"; that are equal, and distinct
from either their predecessor or their successor. The number of consecutive equal signs in the sequence of 'T; is limited to one less than the
number of degrees of freedom. The times where the matrix N gets reduced in rank from its maximum are called the conjugate times, or, if
we think of these events as occurring along the trajectory, the conjugate
points, conjugate to the starting time or the starting point.
The second variation of the integral over the Lagrangian can now
be characterized by the following proposition, due mainly to Marston
Morse:
The second variation, considered as a quadratic form in the displacements 8q('T) of all the possible paths around a given trajectory

16

The Mechanics of Lagrange

from q1 to q11 in the time t, has as many negative eigenvalues as there
are conjugate points along the trajectory.

This simple theorem answers the question about the extremum in
Lagrange's variational principle. For sufficiently short times the classical trajectory is indeed a minimum among all possible paths. But that
nice feature gets lost as soon as the system has passed the first conjugate point. An obvious illustration of this situation is a particle moving
freely on the surface of a sphere. Let the two endpoints q1 and q11 not
be antipodal so that there is a well-defined great circle connecting
them. Moving from q' to q" can be accomplished in two ways: the
shorter route goes directly, whereas the longer one passes through the
antipode of q 1• All the great circles that start in q1 go through its
antipode. All particles starting out in q1 with the same speed will meet
in the antipode. The matrix N is singular there, because a non-vanishing
value of op' yields a vanishing value for oq"; the antipode is, therefore,
conjugate to q1 • Thus, according to the above proposition, the route
through the antipode is not a minimum, as we know already from elementary geometry, but can see now in the context of Lagrangian mechanics.

1.6 The Spreading Trajectories
The relation between classical and quantum mechanics depends on the
way in which a swarm of classical trajectories spreads out. A picture
for the typical situation in two degrees of freedom is shown in Figure
1. The fan of trajectories starting in q' first spreads, but then converges
again so that the individual trajectories cut into one another. Actually,
they form an envelope that looks as if the trajectories made a glancing
reflection from a wall. The envelope is called a caustic, in contrast to
the exceptional situation where all the trajectories starting in q1 go exactly through the same point qf which is then called a focus. Both terms
are taken from the obvious analogy in optics. The antipode in the
above example is obviously a focus for the trajectories on the sphere.
The spread of the trajectories which all start in q' can be watched
very closely if one keeps track of the eigenvalues of N. The explicit
expression (1.18) forM shows that it is symmetric and has, therefore,

CONJUGATE POINT

Figure 1 Fan of trajectories originating in the point q' and intersecting one
another to form a caustic; the main (heavy) trajectory touches the caustic in
the point conjugate to q1• There is a whole sequence of caustics and conjugate
points along the main trajectory.
Conjugate points are the places along the trajectory where one of
the eigenvalues vanishes. The rate at which the largest eigenvalue
grows is called the Lyapounoff exponent of the trajectory. The growth
of these eigenvalues is crucial for judging the long-term behavior of the
dynamical system. In particular, we find instabilities when some of the
eigenvalues grow exponentially with time.
A somewhat abbreviated characterization of the swarm of trajectories is obtained by looking at their density at any one given time.
Consider a little volume in position space that is defined by as many
initial values of 8p' as degrees of freedom. Each such 8p' leads to a
8q" after the time t. The density C(q" q' t) is defined as the ratio of the
volume defined by 8p 1 over the volume defined by the 8q 11 • The formula ( 1.18) now gives us the concise expression
C(q" q' t) =

a2R

aq, i aq,j

( 1.19)

We shall find that the quantum mechanical amplitude of a system that
started out in q1 is essentially given by the square root of C when the
system is observed in q" at the timet.
The mechanics of Lagrange, as presented very briefly in this chapter, comes closest to our most intuitive picture of the way in which
things happen in nature. They start some place and then spread by
small increments as time evolves. Situations which were close to one
another may drift apart more and more, or they may come back together again, at least temporarily.
The next chapter will explain a different view which is not quite as
appealing, but has a certain number of technical advantages both for
experiments and for calculations. Time as the controlling parameter
will be replaced by energy, or equivalently, as is well known from

18

The Mechanics of Lagrange

quantum mechanics, by frequency. Most experiments used to be conducted at a fixed frequency that could not be varied over a large interval in one given apparatus. In recent years, however, electronic
technology has advanced to the point where short-time pulses can be
used to stimulate a physical system. This technical development brings
us back to the basic processes and what I would like to call the
Lagrangian view of nature.

CHAPTER 2

The Mechanics of
Hamilton and Jacobi

The transition from (what is here called) the mechanics of Lagrange,
with time as the main parameter, to the mechanics of Hamilton and
Jacobi, with energy as the controlling variable, is formally easy to carry
out. Its importance becomes apparent when one tries to solve special
problems. The test case is the motion of a body where the force decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the origin. It will be
treated at the end of this chapter and will be given an appealing geometrical solution.

2.1 Phase Space and Its Hamiltonian
The state of a dynamical system at the time t is now specified by giving
its momentum p and its position q, rather than its velocity q and its
position q. If we start by describing the system with the help of its
Lagrangian L, then we have to make the transition from the velocity q
to the momentump via the formula (1.1). This kind of transformation
is well known from thermodynamics and is generally called a Legendre
transformation. It implies a change in the function describing the system at the same time as using its derivatives as the new variables; in
our case that means transforming the Lagrangian L, which is a function
of q, q, and t, into the Hamiltonian H, which is a function of
p, q, and t, with the help of the formulas

20

The Mechanics of Hamilton and Jacobi

(2.1)

Comparing with (1.7), the Hamiltonian can be interpreted as the energy of the dynamical system at the time t.
The space whose points are defined by the n momenta p and the n
coordinates q is called the phase space of the dynamical system. For the
familiar Lagrangian L = T- V with T = miP /2 and V depending only
on q, one finds H = T + V with T = p 2 /2m. In mathematical terminology this is the cotangent bundle for the manifold in which the dynamical system moves.
The Hamilton-Jacobi equations of motion (1.2) become

(2.2)

two sets of first-order equations, rather than one set of second-order
equations in the Newtonian tradition. We can regard them as defined
by a vector-field in phase space, which defines a flow in phase space.
It is given by some kind of gradient of the Hamiltonian H . The opposite signs in the two sets of equations are crucial and cannot be eliminated by any simple device. The consequences of these differing signs
are pursued in a special discipline, symplectic geometry, which is obviously important to the study of mechanics; but we will not discuss this
field, except for a short excursion in Chapter 7.
Conservation of energy in Lagrangian mechanics follows from the
fact that the Lagrangian L does not depend explicitly on the time t ; in
complete analogy, conservation of energy in Hamiltonian mechanics
requires that anI at = 0. The value of H(p, q) then remains constant
along any trajectory. This constant value is usually designated byE as
before, so that we will write H(p, q) =E. In a large measure, the value
of E for a particular trajectory will replace the parameter t in many
applications. The duality between E and t comes out quite naturally in
Hamiltonian mechanics, but its full significance can only be appreciated in quantum mechanics.

2.2 The Action Function S
The replacement of t by E as the independent parameter requires that
we use a new kind of action integral S(q" q1E). It is again defined by
a trajectory from q1 to q"; but instead of the given time interval t, the
energy E of the trajectory is now stipulated. In doing so, another
Legendre transformation is made,

(2.3)

A number of comments are necessary in order to clarify the meaning of the various expressions on the right. The first shows the
Legendre character of the transition from R to S if we recall the relation (1.8), E = - fJRI fJt. The second expression is written as an integral over the trajectory with the time as the parameter of integration;
that may be the practical recipe to adopt in many cases, but it is not in
the spirit of Hamiltonian mechanics. Thus, we arrive at the third expression, which is most often quoted. The integral is calculated for a
curve in phase space that coincides with the trajectory and whose parameter can be any monotonically increasing variable; the value of the
integral does not depend on the particular choice of this parameter.
The element of integration p dq, the scalar product of the vector p with
the vector dq, is the canonical 1-form in the language of symplectic geometry.
This 1-form is important, among other reasons, because it guarantees the particularly simple form (2.2) of the equations of motion.
More specifically, a second coordinate system (j, q) in phase space,
and the transformation formulas p = P(j, q-, t); q = Q(p, q, t) have to
be such that p dq- jidq = dcf>, with a total differential on the righthand side. The interpretation of this relation is again the same as in
thermodynamics: the variables in the function <I> have to be q and qso
that p = ()cf> I ()q and ji = - ()cf> I aq. The function <I> is called the generating function, because the explicit formulas for the change of coordinates can be written as derivatives of <I>.
The independent variables in <I> can be chosen in various ways; a
useful choice is to write p dq + q dp- = d( <I> + p- q} = dW, where
W(q, ji, t) is now considered to be a function of the mixed coordinates,
the old position q and the new momentum ji; this form will be used in
Chapter 5. The equations of motion in the new system have again the
form (2.2) in terms of the new Hamiltonian H' (j, q) =
H(p, q, t) + fJWI fJt. Coordinates in phase space for which the original
1-formp dq is given by the same simple formula up to a total differential are called canonical coordinates. It should be emphasized that a
particular system of canonical coordinates is not tied to any special
Hamiltonian; but for some exceptional Hamiltonian, one might find
canonical coordinates in which this Hamiltonian turns out to have a
simple form. Whether the Hamiltonian can be simplified at all, by any
possible choice of canonical coordinates, depends on the Hamiltonian;

22

The Mechanics of Hamilton and Jacobi

if the simplification is possible, the system is called integrable, and will
be discussed in the next chapter.
The formal relationships between the new action integral S(q" q1E)
and the momentum p' at the beginning as well asp" at the end of the
trajectory are contained in the formulas
as

The partial derivatives with respect to q' and q11 are calculated for the
fixed energy E, whereas in the corresponding formulas (1.8) these derivatives are taken at constant value of t. With this proviso the two sets
of formulas are equivalent.
When going toward quantum mechanics it seems advisable to think
of the integral over p dq as a new and physically relevant 'length' of
the trajectory. In the case of a particle moving freely in (Euclidean)
space, the trajectory is a straight line from q' to q", and its energy E is
now p 2 /2m; the momentum p = mq points in the direction of motion,
as does the increment (differential) dq ; their scalar product p dq is
simply the length (absolute value) of 11 times the length (absolute
value) of dq,pdq = IPI Qq .I Since pi ~ 2mE is constant along
the trajectory, we are left with the integral over I dq I from q1 to q11
which gives simply Iq'' - q' I; therefore
2 .
S(q" q' E) = V,....2_m_E-(q-,-_-q-,)(2.5)
This elementary calculation was carried out verbally rather than algebraically because the relationships between the quantities should be
present in the mind of the reader at an almost instinctual level rather
than as formal propositions to be written down when needed. Notice
the big difference between this last expression and formula (1.5) for
R(q"q' t" -t'), which involves the square of the distance from q' to q"
rather than the distance itself as in (2.5).

2.3 The Variational Principle of Euler and Maupertuis
The variational principle of the last chapter is not easily transferred
from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics. Nevertheless, we will
mention at least one formulation because it is occasionally helpful.
We assume again the most familiar situation where H = T + Vand the
kinetic energy T = p 2 /2m, while the potential energy V depends only
on the position coordinates q. Now we can use the argument of the
preceding paragraph: because the constant value E of H is given, we
find p 2 = 2m(E- V). Moreover, as before, the directions of p and dq

2.3 Variational Principle of Euler and Maupertuis

23

are parallel, and the integrand of (2.3) is given by the product of the
absolute values of p and of dq. Thus,
"
S(q" q' E) = f~ v2m(E- V) I dq I,
(2.6)
q

to be integrated along the trajectory that leads from q' to q". The parameter along the trajectory is again irrelevant since the integrand is
homogeneous of first degree in dq.
The argument that follows is quite similar to the one in Section 1.2;
we start again from a trajectory q0 (T), and we add a small deviation
8q(T) in order to get the path q(T); then we expand the integral (2.6)
in powers of 8q( T) so as to get the first and the second variation. The
equations of motion for the trajectory qo( T) are again found to be
equivalent with the proposition that the first variation 88 = 0.
In this form Maupertuis and Euler gave the world the first variational principle of mechanics in 17 44. This proposition can be given
a purely geometric interpretation: If one defines a length for any curve
in the space of position coordinates q by the integral (2.6), then the
trajectories of a particle with energy E in the potential V(q) have a
vanishing first variation. They can be viewed as the locally shortest
connection between the two endpoints when the distance is measured
by the formula (2.6), exactly as geodesics in a manifold with a
Riemannian metric.

2.4 The Density of Trajectories on the Energy Surface
As in Lagrangian mechanics one can ask what happens to a swarm of
particles that starts from the initial position q' with the energy E, but
taking off in directions p' + 8p'. In contrast to the deviations in initial
momentum of the preceding chapter, which are completely arbitrary,
one has now lost one degree of freedom by specifying the energy to be
the same for all trajectories. The trajectories are bound by the condition H(p, q) = E to a (2n - I)-dimensional surface on phase space, the
surface of constant energy. This restriction leads to a slightly different
definition for the density of trajectories in the neighborhood of the one
that starts in q' and ends in q" at the fixed energy E.
The original expression (1.19) for the density C(q'q''t) in
Lagrangian mechanics is used as starting point; but the derivatives of
the action integral R (q' q''t) are now written in terms of the action integral S(q' q''E), which is defined by (2.3) together with t = lJS/ /JE
from (2.4). The derivatives of R in (1.19) are taken at constant time

24

The Mechanics of Hamilton and Jacobi

t, while the energy is allowed to vary. Thus, we have to allow for a
variation aE/ aq while enforcing the condition

_E!_ = 0 =

which applies either to q' or to q".
The entries in the determinant ( 1.19) become

with the appropriate indices. The n by n determinant with these complicated entries can be written in terms of the n + 1 by n + 1 determinant

DCq"q'E> = c -o1+ 1
Then by n subdeterminant in D, which consists of the second derivatives of S with respect to q' and q" alone, without the last row and
the last column containing the derivatives with respect to E, vanishes.
This can be seen if one writes the conservation of energy with the help
of (2.4) in the form of a first-order partial differential equation for S

The matrix of mixed second derivatives is singular, because the vector
an;ap"1 , the velocity vector according to (2.2), is mapped into 0.
The determinant (2.7) can be made more understandable if we use
a local coordinate system in the neighborhood of the trajectory from
q' to q" ; further details will be worked out in Chapter 7. The coordinate axis for q1 runs along this particular trajectory. The remaining
coordinates, say q2 and q3 , are transverse to the trajectory; for example,
they are chosen at a right angle to the direction of motion along the
trajectory. The velocity vector an; ap"1 has, therefore, the components (q1 , 0, 0 ). Equations (2.9) then tell us that the second derivatives a2 S/ aq"1aq'i vanish whenever either j = 1 or i = 1. The first
row and the first column in the determinant (2.7) vanish, except the

2.4 Density of Trajectories on the Energy Surface

last terms containing the partial derivatives with respect to E. Their
values are obtained from differentiating (2.8) with respect toE, yielding q1 o2 S/ oq1 oE = 1. In this way, we can write
D(q 11 q1E)

(2.10)

where the determinant excludes the indices j = 1 or i = 1. If the
dynamical system has only one degree of freedom, only the first factor
remains in (2.10), and D becomes simply the product of the inverse
velocities at the beginning and at the end.
Although there is only the factor o2S/ oE2 between D and C in
(2.7), the appropriate density of trajectories in the mechanics of
Hamilton and Jacobi is undoubtedly D rather than C. The factor between them is the derivative ot/ oE, which can be interpreted by going
back to the original idea in ( 1.18). The n- dimensional volume of variations op' in the numerator is divided by the variation oE in energy,
and the n-dimensional volume of variations oq" in the denominator is
divided by the variation 0t in arrival time. If the energy E is changed,
but the starting point q' and the endpoint q'' remain fixed, then the
transit time t has to be changed, too. For this reason, one needs the
peculiar division of the volume of endpoints by 8t . The allowed swarm
of trajectories has thereby been effectively constrained to the energy
surface.
There is a more formal aspect to this argument, which betrays our
ultimate goal of reaching the quantum-mechani cal limit. The physical
dimension of Cis [volume in momentum space]/[volume in position
space] as shown in (1.18); but (1.19) has the equivalent physical dimension of [volume in phase space]/[volume in position space]2. If
one takes the square root, the volume of position space appears in the
denominator. Similarly, D has the physical dimension of [volume in
phase space]/[ volume in position space times energy]2, which reduces
after the square root to both [volume of position space] and [energy]
in the denominator. As one goes to quantum mechanics, the [volume
in phase space] in the numerator gets divided by the appropriate power
of Planck's quantum h, leaving only the denominator. Thus, the square
root of D is related to something like a density in energy as well as in
position space that will be called Green's function in Chapter 12.

26

The Mechanics of Hamilton and Jacobi

2.5 Example: Space Travel with a Given Energy
The same problem as in the preceding chapter will now be taken up,
but the conditions are changed to fixing the available energy E rather
than the available time interval t" - t' for the trip from Earth to Mars.
We will first give an analytic expression for the action S(q" q' E) using
the same calculation as in Section 1.4. Then we will give a geometric
construction of Jacobi for finding the trajectory from q' to q" at the
energy E. The main purpose of this exercise is to determine the number
of conjugate points on a Kepler ellipse that will be important in quantizing the hydrogen atom.
The action S(q" q' E) is obtained from the integral (2.3) using the
eccentric anomaly u from ( 1.11) and (1.12) as the parameter of integration, exactly as in the calculation of R(q"q' t"- t') of (1.15). The
result for the direct trajectory is
(2.11)
S(q"q'E) = mvGMa (y + siny- 8- sin8),
where the angle y is given by (1.13a), and 8 by (1.13b), while the
semimajor axis a = - GMm/2E. Notice that this expression for the
action is complete, i.e., it does not depend any longer on solving an
equation like Lambert's (1.14). The right-hand side of (2.11) can be
expanded exactly like ( 1.14) as a power series in the normalized energy
E and the given distances JL and v, including the appropriate modifications for the indirect trajectory, and the positive energies.
The three expressions (1.14), (1.15), and (2.11) are not independent because of the definition (2.3) for Sin terms of R, E, and t. More
striking, however, is the last of the relations (2.4) which allows us to
obtain Lambert's formula (1.14) directly from (2.11) by differentiating with respect to E.
Now to the geometric construction (Jacobi 1842, p. 48): Since the
Sun at the origin 0 is one of the two foci for the Kepler ellipse of our
space trip, the main problem is to find the other focus F from the information that the ellipse has to go through q' and q". The construction
of F, as shown in Figure 2, turns out to be quite simple, provided we
have obtained the length of the semimajor axis a= - GMm/2E from
the given energy E.
The sum of the distance r' = oq' and the distance d ' = q' F equals
2a, so that d' = 2a - r'; similarly, the distance q'' F = d" = 2a - r".
Therefore, we draw a circle of radius d' around q', a circle of radius
d " around q", and find their intersections.
If the sum of the distances Oq' + q' q" + q" 0 is greater than 4a,

words, if the position of 0 and the initial position q' are given, the final
position q" has to be inside a critical ellipse with 0 and q' as foci and
the major axis equal to 4a - r'; otherwise, there is no trajectory from
q' to q" with the energy E. The action S(q" q' E) is not defined outside
this critical ellipse.
If q" is inside the critical ellipse, the second focus F is obtained by
intersecting the two circles, of radius d' around q', and of radius d''
around q". For each of the two possible choices for F, the corresponding Kepler ellipse can be constructed, because not only the
semimajor axis a, but also the eccentricty e as well as the perihelion is
now known. The action S(q" q' E) = f p dq along each of the two ellipses can be calculated without explicit knowledge of the timedependence. The integral contains no worse than the square root of a
quadratic function, and can be worked out in terms of elementary
functions to yield (2.11) without ever invoking Kepler's equation
(1.12).
For q" inside the critical ellipse there are always exactly two intersections, F 1 and F 2 , for the two circles, and therefore, two Kepler ellipses from q' to q" at the energy E. The two trajectories are well
known to tennis players and artillery officers, the straight low shot and
the indirect high shot, both with the same expenditure of energy or gun
powder.
When q" approaches the critical ellipse these two trajectories coalesce and give rise to a conjugate point. Equivalently, all the Kepler

28

The Mechanics of Hamilton and Jacobi

center of attraction 0, with the same energy (major axis), and going through
the same point q' stay inside their common caustic, an ellipse with 0 and q'
as foci.

ellipses through q' with the fixed semimajor axis a lie inside the critical
ellipse and touch it. Indeed, consider the Kepler ellipse through q', with
the focus Fin addition to 0, and with the semimajor axis a. We have
both Oq' + q1F = 2a and Oq" + q" F = 2a, wherever q11 happens to lie.
As we move q11 away from q1 along this Kepler ellipse, we come to the
point where q' and q" lie on a straight line through F. This point lies
on the critical ellipse because we have Oq' + q 1q" + q" 0 = 4a.
Therefore, every trajectory through q' touches the critical ellipse in a
conjugate point, and the critical ellipse itself is a caustic. Notice that
it is not sufficient for the point q" to satisfy the condition that
V(q 11 ) < E to be reached from q' with the energy E. As is well known
in space travel, and shown in Figure 3, a launch window is needed. The
goal of the space journey has to be inside the critical ellipse at the time
of arrival.
In the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, the number
of conjugate points on a trajectory that closes itself smoothly like a
Kepler ellipse is of great importance. The construction of the critical
ellipse has shown the existence of one conjugate point on any given
trajectory through q'. A second conjugate point is q' itself since all
trajectories starting there return to it; q1 is a focus rather than simply

2.5 Example: Space Travel with a Given Energy

29

a point on a caustic. Thus, there are two conjugate points along one
closed Kepler ellipse in two dimensions.
When the electron is allowed to move in three dimensions, the
construction remains the same as above, but the plane of the Kepler
ellipse can be any which contains both 0 and q'. Therefore, the collection of Kepler ellipses through 0 and q' can be rotated around the
line joining 0 and q1• We now get a third conjugate point where the
trajectory intersects this line, just as the first conjugate point was located on the straight line through q1 and the focus F. Finally, all the
Kepler ellipses return to q1 regardless of their orientation in space, so
that the point q' becomes a double conjugate point since a twoparameter family of trajectories all meet there again (cf. Gutzwiller
1967 and 1969). In conclusion, there are four conjugate points on the
Kepler ellipse in three dimensions. This difference in the number of
conjugate points accounts for the different energy spectra of the hydrogen atom, with half-integer quantum numbers in two dimensions
and integer quantum numbers in three dimensions, as will be discussed
in Chapter 14.

CHAPTER 3

Integrable Systems

Chaotic dynamical systems are the main topic of this book. Many
readers, however, have grown up in the belief that most systems of interest are regular. The contrast between regular and chaotic behavior
has to be well understood in order to appreciate the novel features in
the chaotic systems. Therefore, this chapter is devoted to the discussion of the regular systems, and in particular to the display of some
of the more challenging examples.
Since the discusssion of integrable systems has been the mainstay
of all the advanced textbooks on classical mechanics, this topic is highly
developed, and an adequate account would take up too much space.
We shall try, therefore, to explain the salient features without proofs
or elaborate calculations. Nevertheless, the ideas will be presented
with greater care than might at first appear necessary, not so much for
dealing with the examples in this chapter, as in view of the more difficult discussion of the three-body problem and the methods for its solution in Chapters 4 and 5.

3.1 Constants of Motion and Poisson Brackets
Integrable dynamical systems are characterized by the existence of constants of motion in addition to the energy. It may not always be easy to
find an explicit expression for these, but their presence can immediately
be recognized because they generate invariant tori in phase space.
What constants of motion and invariant tori are, and what they do for

3.1 Constants of Motion and Poisson Brackets

31

the dynamical system, will be explained in the next few paragraphs.
The adjectives 'integrable' and 'separable' designate systems that behave essentially in the same way. The small difference in meaning between these two words will be explained at the end of the chapter.
Although we started out with Lagrangian mechanics and declared
it to be the more fundamental and natural approach to the secrets of
the universe, most of the discussion concerning special examples will
be done in the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics. First, the
Hamiltonian n(p, q) of the dynamical system will be written down, and
then the equations of motion (2.2). Suppose that these two steps have
been completed, and a function F(p, q) is discovered, defined in the
relevant part of phase space, with the following property: The value
of F stays constant as a function of time t when its arguments,
p and q, are replaced by a solution of the equations of motion (2.2).
Such a function is called a constant of motion of the dynamical system.
The constant value along a trajectory in phase space requires that

O = ..!!_F(p ) =
dt
' q

=

aF dp
ap dt +
an aF
-ap- -aq-

aF dq
aq dt

(3.1)

= [n,F].

The second line defines the Poisson bracket [n, F], which can be computed for any two functions in phase space. The vanishing of the
Poisson bracket between the Hamiltonian n and the function F
throughout phase space makes F a constant of motion.
This last condition can be given a geometric interpretation: the vector field ( - ani aq, ani ap) in phase space is tangent to the surface
F(p, q) = constant. Conversely, the vector field ( - aFI aq, aFI ap) is
tangent to the energy surface n(p, q) = E. The trajectory lies in the
intersection of these two surfaces in phase space.
A whole collection of constants of motion might be found for the
dynamical system; call them F 1, F 2 , . .• . Each constant has a vanishing
Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian in accordance with (3.1).
Moreover, it is important that they are independent of one another; it
should not be possible to express F 3 as a function of F 1 and F 2 . The
trajectory then lies in the intersection of all the surfaces
Fi(p, q) = constant with the appropriate values of these constants.
These restrictions on the constants of motion, however, are not
sufficient as yet to assist in solving the equations of motion. The next
paragraph will discuss additional conditions to be imposed on the constants of motion; if they are satisfied, a special system of coordinates
can be constructed in phase space: the action-angle variables, which
account for the special properties of integrable systems.

32

Integrable Systems

A dynamical system with n degrees of freedom has a phase space
of 2n dimensions. Suppose that we have been able to find k independent constants of motion including the energy H(p, q) =E. The
trajectory is then restricted to a (2n - k)- dimensional subspace of the
whole phase space. This subspace contains k different vectorfields,
one from each of the k constants of motion; but these vectorfields are
generally not compatible with one another. One can choose a curve C1
by following the first vectorfield, and take each point of C 1 as starting
point for a set of curves C2 along the second vectorfield; this set of
curves defines a two-dimensional surface in phase space. It would be
nice if this surface not only was filled with the curves C2 along the
second vectorfield, but also could be covered with curves of the type
C 1 along the first vectorfield. This cannot be done, however, unless the
two constants of motion F 1 and F2 are in involution, which means that
their Poisson bracket vanishes. In general, therefore, the existence of k
integrals of motion does not leave the remaining (2n - k)-dimensional
manifold with a simple internal structure, unless the constants of motion are in involution with one another.

3.2 Invariant Tori and Action-Angle Variables
The most favorable circumstances are achieved when there are at least
n constants of motion in involution, as many as there are degrees of
freedom. The trajectory is then confined to ann-dimensional manifold
that is covered by n compatible vectorfields. Let us assume, moreover,
that none of these vectorfields ever vanishes on the manifold of interest. Then, by a remarkable theorem of topology, this manifold has the
shape of an n-dimensional torus; i.e., by a smooth deformation the
manifold can be transformed into ann-dimensional cube whose points
on opposite sides are identified. Each trajectory of the dynamical lies
inside such an invariant torus. The dynamical system is then called
integrable.
The reader may be familiar with the fact that n constants in
involution imply the integrability of the dynamical system, or equivalently, the possibility of finding explicit solutions for the equations of
motion. But to demand the existence of these constants of motions is
much more restrictive than is generally realized; when they do exist,
however, the mechanical system can be described in very explicit detail.
The next step in the treatment of such systems is the construction of
action-angle variables.
Before getting into the technical details, the reader should try to
imagine why, in a system with two degrees of freedom and two con-

3.2 Invariant Tori and Action-Angle Variables

33

stants of motion in involution, the trajectories cannot lie on a sphere
(or a surface with the same topology, like an egg or a pear); it is impossible to define a vectorfield on a sphere that does not vanish somewhere; just as it is impossible to comb down the hair on one's head
without admitting a part or an eddy. On the surface of a torus that is
covered with hair, however, there is no trouble in combing it down flat
everywhere.
The deformation of the manifold into the n-dimensional cube can
be used to define new coordinates (wt, K72, •.. , wn), called angle variables, designated as w collectively, each of which varies from 0 to 2'1T
like an angle. If the n compatible vector-fields are taken as the basis
for these coordinates, the vector-field (- oH/op, oH/oq) has constant components throughout the manifold, (wt. w2 , ... , wn), called the
frequencies of the dynamical system, and the trajectories become
straight lines. The set of frequencies w depends on the values of the
constants of motion for the particular invariant torus. Therefore, the
ratios between the individual frequencies for a particular torus are,
generally, irrational numbers; they become rational only for special
values of the constants of motion. As a word of caution, the whole
problem of solving the equations of motion is hidden in the few sentences of this paragraph and the next.
The coordinates w are used as the position coordinates in a new set
of canonical coordinates for the whole of phase space (cf. Section
2.2); or as one half of a system of canonically conjugate coordinates.
The other half of these coordinates will be called (It, h, ... , In), abbreviated by the single letter I. The action integral S in (2.3) as an
integral over p dq now becomes an integral over I dw. If the reader is
willing to admit the existence of the variables I with the property that
p dq = I dw (its construction will be discussed quite generally in
Chapter 7), then the explicit calculation of I proceeds as follows.
Suppose that only wi varies, and that it runs from 0 to 2'1T; a closed
loop Ci is thereby defined in the original coordinates (p, q) of phase
space. Since the action integrals in the two coordinate systems have
to agree, we find immediately the formulas

Ii =

2~ fcp dq .

(3.2)

l

The new variables I play the role of momentum with respect to the
positions w ; they are called actions, while the variables w are called
angles. Together they form the action-angle variables.
Most textbooks in classical mechanics present the transformation
of an integrable system from the original coordinates (p, q) to the
action-angle variables (I, w), using Jacobi's theory of first-order partial
differential equations. Quite in contrast, the above discussion relies as

34

Integrable Systems

a first step on finding the appropriate angular variables w ; they are
obvious as soon as the invariant tori in phase space have been recognized, and vice versa. If the trajectories can be written in terms of as
many angular variables as degrees of freedom, then the invariant tori
have been obtained explicitly, as will be shown in the next section.
Most of the recent work on chaos in classical mechanics starts from a
search for the invariant tori, while most of the classical work in celestial
mechanics starts out by writing the coordinates in terms of angular
variables. Thus, our presentation stays close to these two important
applications of Jacobi's general theory.

3.3 Multiperiodic Motion
The most important statement in the preceding section concerned the
time-dependence of the angle variables: they could be chosen such that
their derivatives with respect to time, the frequencies w, were the same
on the whole invariant torus. The equations of motion (2.2) in the
action-angle variables now take the trivial form
iJH
dw;
iJH
di;
(3.3)
= W;.
= - = - -iJw; = 0
iJI;
dt
dt
The usual arguments have been reversed: since the actions I are constants of motion, the Hamiltonian can no longer depend on the angles
w ; also, the frequencies w are simply the derivatives of the Hamiltonian
with respect to the actions I . The Hamiltonian in the new coordinates
does not depend on the angles, and is, therefore, written in the form
H(h, h, ... , In), not to be confused with the previous expression
H(p, q), which uses the same letter H to designate another function!
The action-angle variables give the complete solution of the equations
of motion. The general solution of (3.3) is given by w; = w; t + cp;,
where the frequencies w are determined by the values chosen for the
actions I, and the phase angles cf> can be chosen arbitrarily. There are
many useful angle-type variables in any special problem, like the true
or the eccentric anomaly in the Kepler problem (cf. Section 1.4); but
their variation with time is not linear in general; they are not angle
variables as defined above, in contrast to the mean anomaly. The difficulty with integrating the equations of motion here consists in finding
the angle-type variables whose time-dependence is indeed linear.
When transforming back from the action-angle variables to the original set (p , q), one sees that they are periodic with period 2'7T in each
one of the angles w. It is, therefore, natural to make Fourier expansions
in w,

exp[i(k 1w1 + ·· · + knwn)], (3.4)

kt, . .. 'k.

where each integer k goes from -oo to +oo. Formula (3.4) is shorthand
for one such expansion for each component of p and q. The expansion
coefficients P and Q are complex numbers and depend on the values
of the actions I ; but they satisfy the simple relation PfkJ = Pr _ k],
where + indicates the complex conjugate, to make the sum over the
multi-index [k] = (k 1, ... , kn) real. If the motion of a Hamiltonian
system can be written in the form (3.4), it is called multiperiodic.
How does a perturbation look in the action-angle coordinates? In
most of the interesting cases the perturbation arises as an additional
time-dependent potential energy V(q, t) that is periodic with the frequency w 0 with respect to t. In the action-angle variables of the dynamical system, V(q, t) becomes again a Fourier series,
V(q, t)

=

L

ko, kt, ... , kn

Vko. k 1 , ... , k. exp[i(kow0 + k 1w1 + · · · + knwn)], (3.5)

where the complex coefficients Vko. kt, ... , k. are functions of I. The same
symmetry conditions among them apply as for P and Q in (3.4), to
obtain a real value for the sum. The periodic time-dependence of the
potential V(q, t) has been included in the Fourier expansion through
the angle wo = wot + cf>o; but in contrast to the other frequencies, wo
does not depend on the values of the actions I.
This whole theory of integrable systems will now be illustrated with
three examples of a slightly more complicated kind than the ones ordinarily found in textbooks. The purpose of this presentation is not to
offer a complete discussion of the solution, but to provide the reader
with some material for practice and enjoyment on examples which can
be treated without lengthy development. The frequencies w depend
on the actions I in a non-trivial manner, which means that the matrix
of derivatives of w with respect to I is not singular. This condition is
not satisfied by the usual textbook examples, like the Kepler problem
or a system of linearly coupled oscillators. Therefore, these two systems, although integrable, present special difficulties when perturbations are applied, or the transition to quantum mechanics is made.
The three examples, though typical of integrable systems, are special in other ways. All three of them are non-trivial in the sense that
their integration came as a surprise to the specialists in the field, and
the authors who first succeeded in solving the problem became famous
among scientists for having done it. Moreover, each one of the three
solves an important general question in physics or in geometry. They
will be taken in their historic order.

3.4 The Hydrogen Molecule Ion
Two protons are fixed in the position A and B a distance 2c away from
each other, in the locations (0, 0, - c) and (0, 0, c) of a Cartesian coordinate system. A single electron at (x, y, z) is subject to the
Coulomb attraction of both protons. Let rA be its distance from A, and
r 8 its distance from B; the Hamiltonian is then given by
2

2

H =

_!_ - e 2 ( __!_ + - 1-) + _!!__
2m

~

~

2c

(3.6)

where the constant e2 /2c has been added in order to account for the
electrostatic repulsion of the two protons.
The solution of this problem can be rated, with only slight exaggeration, as the most important in quantum mechanics, because if an energy level with a negative value of E can be found, the chemical bond
between two protons by a single electron has been explained. Classical
mechanics yields all kinds of interesting trajectories for this problem,
but none of them is safe from losing energy by some external perturbation and thereby leading to the collapse of the molecule. This situation remains even if one tries to replace the point charge of the
electron by a charge cloud.
The classical problem was first solved by Euler in the context of two
stationary heavy masses exerting a gravitational attraction on a third
light mass. The solution is rather easy when one defines elliptical coordinates with the heavy masses at the two foci. The equations of
motion can then be separated into three sets of second-order equations,
with each set solved by elliptic functions.
Two of the constants of motion are obvious: the total energy E, and
the angular momentum M = xv - yu around the z-axis, where the
Cartesian components of the momentum are called (u, v, w). The third
constant of motion, however, is difficult to write down in a physically
appealing manner; one expression is the following,
2
(3.7)
cos 88 ),
Q = LALB + 2me c (cos 8A where LA and L 8 are the angular momentum vectors of the electron
around A and around B, while 8A and 88 are the angular distances of
the electron from the axis of the molecule, as seen from A and from
B. The three variables H, M, and Q are in involution.
The classical problem has three physical parameters: the distance
2c between the two protons, the mass m of the electron, and its electric
charge e ; therefore, all dynamical variables can be normalized classically. The energy is measured in units of e 2 I c, and Q in units of

3.4 The Hydrogen Molecule Ion

37

2m e 2c; the trajectories cannot be scaled with the energy E as in the
Kepler problem.
Before discussing the results, a little history of the problem is well
worth telling. After Bohr had given the first solution of a quantummechanical problem in 1913 by deriving the energy spectrum of the
hydrogen atom, Sommerfeld generalized Bohr's idea, and then asked
his precocious student, Wolfgang Pauli aged 19, to treat the hydrogen
molecule ion for his Ph.D. thesis. At that time, in 1919, it was not
known whether there exists such a molecule as the singly ionized H:f.
Something like it had been seen, but under conditions which made it
unlikely that the ion would be stable.
Pauli (1922) applied the rules which Bohr and Sommerfeld had
proposed and concluded that the hydrogen molecule ion could only be
metastable. He showed that its lowest energy level (3.6) was positive;
but it would only decay because of collisions, and not by emitting light
as most other unstable atoms or molecules. As soon as Schroedinger's
equation had been established in 1926, the problem was solved correctly, and the energy of the lowest state was found to be negative (for
the relevant references, cf. Strand and Reinhardt 1979).
Pauli worked exactly in the no-person's land between classical and
quantum mechnics which is our main concern here. It would be very
painful if his problem could not be done correctly at least to the point
of obtaining a negative energy. It turns out that Pauli did not know
about the role of conjugate points along the classical trajectories, and
their importance for the approach to quantum mechanics. His
quantization conditions were too restrictive; his wavelets made a hard
reflection on the caustics instead of a soft one, changing their phases
by 'TT instead of 'TT /2, as will be explained in Chapter 14.
The semiclassical quantization of the hydrogen molecule ion was
carried out recently by Strand and Reinhardt (1979), using the improved quantization rules that will be discussed later. Their pictures
of the classical trajectories are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The energy
is defined such that E =
+ 1/2, and n = y. The three figures have the common values E = 0 and M = 0, whereas Q has been
given the values 0.4, 1.0, and 2.4.
Remarkably, the lowest quantum-mechanical state corresponds to
the value 0.4 of Q as in Figure 4. The trajectory for this value of Q does
not surround both protons as do the two other trajectories; it is confined to a region around one proton or the other. The electron takes
advantage of an opportunity which is not available in classical mechanics, tunneling from one trajectory to another, from the neighborhood of one proton to the neighborhood of the other, back and forth.

Hz ;

The potential energy of the electron at the center of the molecule
is quite negative when rA = r 8 = c; the need for the electron to tunnel
is not due to its inadequate energy. The classical trajectory is limited
by the dynamics of the problem, in much the same way the Kepler ellipses were confined to a critical ellipse. It is a big open problem to
make classical mechanics in general cope with this quantummechanical phenomenon; some of the difficulties are discussed in the
work of Strand and Reinhardt. Section 14.6 will briefly present one
approach to the problem of tunneling in dynamical systems.

If the initial position of the particle satisfies (3.8), and the initial momentum is tangential to (3.8), then the whole trajectory stays on the
ellipsoid.

and similar ones, B and C, which are obtained by the cyclic permutation of the triples (x,y, z), (u, v, w), and (a, b, c), are indeed constants
of motion. These three quantities are not independent since one has
the relation A + B + C = u 2 + v 2 + w2, where the right-hand side is
the kinetic energy which is in fact the Hamiltonian of the system.
A, B, and C are in involution.
The geodesics on a two-dimensional surface are the trajectories of a
freely moving particle; for the triaxial ellipsoid they were found by
Jacobi (1842, p. 212), who used quite a different method. He introduced triaxial elliptic coordinates in three-dimensional Euclidean space
which constituted a difficult generalization of Euler's coordinate system in the preceding problem. The equations of motion can then be
separated, and the motion for each coordinate is given again by an elliptic function. The geodesics on a multi-axial ellipsoid in higher dimensions have recently been discussed by Moser ( 1980); billiards
inside an ellipse have been discussed recently by Chang and Friedberg
(1988).
As in the preceding problem, we have simply quoted the constants
of motion, without trying to integrate the equations of motion. As
before, they turn out to be some kind of angular momenta, and are at
most quadratic in the momentum (u, v, w). Although it took Euler in
the first case, and Jacobi in the second, to find a method for integrating
the equations of motion, the solutions they found are in a sense elementary. It suffices to find the appropriate coordinate system in position space, and the rest follows. Until some 20 years ago, that was the
only successful method known. The next example shows that certain
dynamical systems are integrable, but their constants of motion are
much more involved; there are no special position coordinates where
the equations of motion separate.

3.6 The Toda Lattice
The lattice or chain consists of n particles which move along a straight
line and are coupled by non-linear springs. If the particle i has the
momentum Pi and the position qi, then the Hamiltonian becomes
H =

1
-2

m

n

~

2

(n)

~

LJ Pi + V0 LJ exp (
I

I

qi - qi + I
a
),

(3.12)

where we have two possibilities which are indicated by the symbol (n)
in the last summation: for the open lattice we set (n) = n - 1, while for
the periodic lattice we set (n) = n along with the convention
qn +I= q1.
Several comments are necessary to appreciate the remarkable
properties of this Hamiltonian. There are three physical parameters,
the mass m of each particle, the strength V0 of the potential, and the
range a of the potential. It is natural to choose these parameters as the
physical units, so that the Hamiltonian contains only dimensionless
quantities. Once this has been accomplished, however, any new physical quantity cannot be reduced to 1 by the choice of the physical units.
In particular, when going to quantum mechanics, Planck's quantum h
now has some definite numerical value, small, medium, or large.
This situation is expected to prevail in any truly non-linear system;
but no other integrable system known so far has this typical structure.
All the others have at most two physical quantities, :so that the transition to quantum mechanics does not allow the possibility of distinguishing the effects of a large or small Planck's quantum. The various
domains of physics such as the motion of atoms in molecules and
crystals, the motion of electrons in atoms and molecules, the motion
of protons and neutrons in nuclei, and finally, the motion of elementary
particles inside their little boxes, yield a Planck's quantum equal to 1,
if one uses whatever units are natural to the system. The limit of a
small Planck's quantum is a mathematical fiction when we come to the
fields where quantum mechanics is important; but this fiction is apparently unavoidable if we want to form some intuitive picture of the
events on the microscopic scale.
Toda (1967, 1970) invented his chain of particles and springs, and
gave a special solution for it, a soliton. Up to that time, solitons had
been found only in continuum mechanics, that is in non-linear systems
where the masses are distributed continuously over the available space.
Solitons are solutions of the equations of motion in which an isolated
bump moves at constant speed. Such special solutions are not hard to
find in continuous systems; but once found they must be shown to be
stable against small disturbances. In discrete systems, however, it is

42

Integrable Systems

very difficult to get such solutions in the first place, let alone to show
their stability. Toda's solution requires an intimate knowledge of elliptic functions, and stability was not shown at first.
It occurred to Joseph Ford in 1973 to test numerically the
integrability of the Hamiltonian (3.12), i.e., the presence or absence
of invariant tori, using the standard method of surfaces of section to
be explained in Chapter 7. He expected the system to be chaotic because it is close to the well-known Henon-Heiles system, which will
be the main topic of Chapter 8.
The numerical calculation was carried out by Ford, Stoddard, and
Turner (1973), for the simplest case of interest, n = 3. The verdict
was clear: the Toda lattice is integrable. Ford communicated this
finding to Henon (1974) and Flaschka (1974), who discovered independently, within less than a week and by two different methods, how
to construct the missing constants of motion. We will discuss
Flaschka's procedure because it is closely patterned after the general
method that Lax (1968) invented for the discussion of the solitons in
continuum mechanics.
The main idea is contained in the following statement whose proof
is almost trivial. Assume that two matrices, L and M, have been constructed whose elements depend on the parameter t, and which satisfy
the condition
dL=LM-ML
dt

(3.13)

Then the eigenvalues of L, or equivalently, the coefficients in the
characteristic polynomial, det(L - A./), do not vary with t. The matrices L for different values of t are said to form an isospectral series.
Methods for finding such a Lax pair (L, M) are discussed by Greene,
Tabor, and Carnevale (1983).
For the Toda lattice, the matrices L

in terms of the momenta p; and the positions q;. The element an is zero
for the open chain. The equations of motion for the Toda lattice are
identical with the condition (3.13).

3.6 The Toda Lattice

43

The constants of motion are the coefficients in the characteristic
polynomial of L; or more explicitly, let F 1 be the trace, and let Fj be the
sum of the j-th principal minors. In this manner one gets for the two
first constants the expressions
F1 =

Lbi = LPi = total momentum P,

which are, of course, elementary, while the third constant is already
rather complicated, and is left to the reader as an exercise. One notices
immediately that the j-th constant is a polynomial of order j in the
momenta p. This is an entirely novel situation compared with the previously known integrable systems with a finite number of degrees of
freedom, where the additional constants of motion were at most
quadratic in the momenta.

3. 7 Integrable versus Separable
Both the motion of a small mass moving in the gravitational field
or in the Coulomb field of two large masses, and the problem of the
free motion on the surface of a triaxial ellipsoid could be solved after
the appropriate position coordinates had been found. That procedure
is called separation of variables; it results in constants of motion which
are at most quadratic in the momenta; the equations of motion can be
solved by 'quadrature', e.g., by elliptic integrals. Such a problem is
called separable.
The Toda lattice cannot be treated in this way, and what is worse,
the knowledge of the constants of motion does not automatically lead
to a set of coordinates in which the equations of motion become very
simple, such as in the action-angle variables. Such a system is called
integrable, but non-separable, a somewhat misleading term, because it
implies only the ability to integrate, but does not guarantee the explicit
construction of the integrating variables.
The complete integration of the Toda lattice has been discussed by
several authors, including Kac and van Moerbeke ( 197 4) and Moser
(1975a and b). The fascinating part of this work, in addition to the
many beautiful mathematical propositions which appear there, is its
implication for the corresponding quantum problem. It turns out that
Schrodinger's equation always separates when the classical problem is
separable. Nothing of the sort happens in the Toda lattice; there is no

44

Integrable Systems

easy analog to the involved transformations that are necessary in the
classical Toda lattice.
The main obstacle is the intimate mixture between position and
momentum coordinates which finally yields the action-angle variables.
The construction of the wavefunctions that are simultaneous
eigenfunctions of the constants of motion is tricky. The author
(Gutzwiller 1981 b) has succeeded in carrying out the necessary transformation of Hilbert space for n up to and including 4; the results are
easily generalized ton ~ 5. But nobody seems to have gone beyond
n = 4, at least not to the point of proving an explicit algorithm for calculating the spectrum (cf. Sklyanin 1985).
It is general wisdom in modern physics that problems are solvable
because they have symmetries which are responsible for their privileged situation with respect to all the other problems. But in none of
the cases in this chapter are these symmetries particularly obvious, although they are known by now. It is not clear to what extent these
known symmetries not only provide constants of motion, but are also
helpful in constructing explicit solutions for the equations of motion
or in finding simultaneous eigenfunctions.
In a more general context, the issue of symmetry is largely unresolved in view of the chaotic behavior of most dynamical systems. The
traditional concept of symmetry is such that it leads to integrability
wherever it applies. Its absence is then equivalent to chaos; but some
chaotic mechanical systems exhibit simplifying features which have the
same appeal as the usual idea of symmetry. One is tempted to set up
a new goal in the study of dynamical systems, namely to find the new
types of symmetry which allow the classical equations of motion and
Schrodinger's equation to be solved in some effective manner, even
when the system is not integrable and its behavior is chaotic by our
present criteria.

CHAPTER 4

The Three-Body Problem:
Moon - Earth - Sun

The problem of three interacting point-like masses continues to be at
the center of physics. The latest version consists of three quarks making up a proton or a neutron; but there are also two hydrogens and one
oxygen as the constituents of a water molecule, or an atom of helium
built with one alpha particle and two electrons. Behind these modern
examples are all the famous instances from celestial mechanics, particularly the most obvious as well as the most difficult of them all, the
motion of the Moon in the combined gravitational field of the Earth
and the Sun. Since chaos made its first though hardly recognized appearance in this context, and the case is far from closed, an abbreviated
discussion of this special problem seems both instructive and topical.

4.1 Reduction to Four Degrees of Freedom
Newton was the first scientist to investigate the problem of three massive bodies attracting one another with a force which decreases as the
inverse square of the distance. In the case of the Moon, deviations
from the standard theory had already been correctly determined by
Ptolemy of Alexandria in the second century a.C., and a number of
further refinements had been introduced by Tycho Brahe at the end
of the sixteenth century, all based on naked-eye observations. Newton
succeeded in explaining why the Moon's orbital plane turns in a direc-

46

The Three-Body Problem: Moon- Earth- Sun

tion opposite to the motion of the planets, making one full turn every
18 years. But his calculation for the motion of the Moon's perigee in
the same sense as the planets was too small by a factor of 2.
In 18 7 8, almost two centuries later, George William Hill finally
pro,vided a natural explanation, and discussed in the process for the
first time what has now become known as Hill's equation. His analysis
is fundamental for the study of non-linear mechanics, integrable or
chaotic. The three-body problem has provided the main inspiration for
the development of mechanics, to the point where Poincare eventually
recognized the need to deal with chaotic systems, just about 100 years
ago. The author has devoted several years to the study of the Moon's
motion so that it seems entirely appropriate if the reader is offered
some of this collective wisdom.
Astronomical observations from the surface of the Earth do not allow measurements to better than 1 second of arc, because the turbulence of the air causes the image of any object in the sky to blur. A
telescope with an objective opening of 10 em gives already this kind
of resolution. The Moon moves over the background of fixed stars at
a rate of about 1 second of arc in 2 seconds of time; her movements
can be tracked quite adequately with an ordinary stop-watch to a precision of a fraction of a second. The perturbation of the planets can
be neglected at this level of accuracy. The flattening of the Earth is
accounted for by a small correction, as are several other minor effects.
All that is left is the combined action of the Moon, the Earth, and the
Sun, considered as perfectly spherical structures with the masses L for the
Moon (Luna), T for the Earth (Terra), and S for the Sun (Sol).
There are nine degrees of freedom, which can best be described
with the following set of coordinates:
(i) R 0 = (X0 , Y0 , Z 0 ) for the common center of mass of the
three bodies;
(ii) R = (X, Y, Z) for the vector which points from S to the
center of mass r of T and L;
(iii) r = (x,y,z) forthevectorfrom TtoL.
The phase space of this system has 18 dimensions, after we have
added the momenta Po= (U0 , Vo, W0 ), P = (U, V, W), and
p = (u, v, w) to the positions. Ten constants of motion can be immediately recognized:
(i) Since the center of mass moves with a uniform motion which
has no effect on the internal movements of the three bodies, we
can eliminate both R 0 and P 0 , thereby reducing the phase space
by six dimensions.

4.1 Reduction to Four Degrees of Freedom

47

(ii) The angular momentum of the whole system is constant; its
direction determines an invariant plane through the center of
mass. To a very good approximation, r moves around S in a
Kepler ellipse whose (almost invariant) plane is called the ecliptic
because the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon occur when all three
bodies are in it. The absolute value of the angular momentum determines essentially the eccentricity of the orbit of r, the EarthMoon center of mass, around the Sun.
(iii) The total energy of the system, assuming that R 0 = 0, gives
the Hamiltonian of the internal motion; its value determines basically the major axis for the motion of r around the Sun; the energy is the tenth and last constant of motion.

After reducing phase space to eight dimensions with the help of the
ten constants of motion, the system is left with four degrees of freedom. The Hamiltonian is best written in terms of thf~ reduced masses

The three components of angular momentum are still constants of
motion at this stage, in addition to the Hamiltonian itself. Are there
any others?
This question is answered to some extent by a theorem of Bruns and
Poincare: There does not exist any constant of motion which is analytic
in the variables P, p, R, r as well as in the mass ratios, (T + L)/ S and
LIT, except the angular momentum and the total energy. Notice that
the constant of motion has to be analytic simultaneously in the coordinates and the mass ratios, to fit the assumptions of the theorem. A
constant of motion could possibly be found which fails to be analytic
in the mass ratios. (A detailed account of this theorem is found in the
textbook by Whittaker (1904), Chapter XIV.) A modern discussion
of this theorem was given by Benettin, Galgani, and Giorgilli (1985).
Such a case arises in the theory of the gyroscope in a uniform
gravitational field, a rigid body of arbitrary shape and mass distribution
that is suspended from one fixed point and is subject to a homogeneous
gravitational field. Sofia Kowalevskaya found in 1890 an isolated case

48

The Three-Body Problem: Moon- Earth- Sun

of integrability when the moments of inertia are A = B = 2C with the
suspension in the plane corresponding to the directions of the moments
A and B. The only two other cases of integrability for the gyroscope
are Euler's freely rotating rigid body and Lagrange's symmetric top
with the suspension in the axis of symmetry. No such exceptional cases
have been found for the three-body problem (cf. Leimanis 1965).
The absence of analytic constants of motion should not discourage
us completely, because there could be some which depend on the
momenta and positions like a real function with rather high-order
bounded derivatives. All the observational, analytical, and computational evidence in the Moon-Earth-Sun motion encourages this view,
although the mathematical proofs on the basis of the above
Hamiltonian (4.2) are missing. We will, therefore, continue the discussion as if the problem were indeed integrable.

4.2 Applications in Atomic Physics and Chemistry

The three-body problem has a close analog in atomic physics. The
helium-atom consists of an a-particle, a nucleus containing two protons
and two neutrons, and two electrons; but there are other atoms with
only two electrons, such as the negative ion of hydrogen, which was
first found in the solar atmosphere, or the once ionized lithium, the
twice ionized beryllium, and so on. The closest analog in celestial mechanics is the problem of the Jupiter-Saturn coupling in the solar system; these two most massive planets have their periods very close to a
2:5 ratio, and perturb each other's motion more effectively than a
simple estimate of their interaction would indicate. A similar situation
arises when two electrons in an atom get highly excited without being
ejected; this effect has been studied recently in many different variations and is known as the planetary atom (cf. RS Berry 1986).
The electrostatic forces between the nucleus and the electrons, as
well as between the electrons, are similar to the gravitational forces,
since they vary with the inverse square of the distance; but these forces
are not propotional to the masses of the particles on which they act,
and they can be both attractive and repulsive, depending on the relative
signs of the electric charges on the particles. Furthermore, the
electrons obey Pauli's exclusion principle, which causes special restrictions in their freedom of motion.
The analogy between celestial mechanics and chemistry is more remote, although there is a great variety of interesting cases. The most
immediate case consists of two protons and one electron, the hydrogen
molecule ion of the preceding chapter, but this time without restriction

4.2 Applications in Atomic Physics and Chemistry

49

on the motion of the protons. They are allowed to move, either by rotating around each other, or by oscillating like two masses connected
by a spring. The forces are still of the inverse square type, as in the
helium atom.
The most important situation in chemistry, however, involves the
motion of three nuclei that interact with one another through the intermediary of electrons, such as in the water molecule H 2 0. The forces
between the three nuclei cannot be described mathematically without
first solving a rather difficult problem in quantum mechanics. The
procedure, called the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, can be described in the following simplified manner: each of the three nuclei is
assigned a fixed position in space, such as R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and the energy
of the electrons E(R 1, R2 , R3 ) is computed by solving the corresponding Schrodinger equation. This electronic energy, together with the
electrostatic repulsion between the nuclei, yields the potential energy
V(R 1, R 2 , R 3 ) of the molecule, which then takes the place of the three
last terms in (4.2).
This method of treating the motion of the nuclei inside a molecule
assumes that the electrons are light enough to follow the motion of the
nuclei almost instantaneously; it works well as long as there is no
drastic reorganization of the molecule. Another way of stating this
assumption is to say that the energy differences for an electronic transition are large compared with the energy quantum for a vibrational
mode, which in turn is greater than the energy difference in a rotational
transition.
In a typical chemical reaction, the atom A hits the molecule BC,
with the result that the new molecule AB is formed while the atom C
flies off. The new molecule AB might be left in an excited state;
sometimes during the process, the electrons in the whole system found
it advantageous to pass from their ground-state energy £ 0 (R 1, R 2 , R 3 )
to the excited energy level £ 1(R 1, R 2 , R 3 ). The calculation of the
classical trajectory starts with the potential energy V0 , and ends with
the potential energy V1; an additional calculation in quantum mechanics yields a probability P 01 that depends again on the coordinates
R 1, R 2 , R 3 , and controls the transfer of the electronic system from the
ground state to the excited state.
In all these cases, one treats a mechanical system consisting of three
bodies, each moving in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The phase
space has 18 dimensions, but there are always the same ten constants
of motion, six from the uniform center-of-mass motion, three from the
total angular momentum, and one from the total energy, kinetic plus
potential; one is left with four degrees of freedom. The chemical
problems require a major preliminary calculation to determine the potential energy of the electrons as a function of the nuclear positions.

50

The Three-Body Problem: Moon - Earth- Sun

As soon as this step has been completed, however, the analogy with
celestial mechanics becomes quite striking. Some early calculations of
classical trajectories for chemical reactions were carried out by Thiele
and Wilson (1961) as well as Bunker (1962).
The spontaneous break-up of a three-star system, or its inverse, the
capture of a third body, corresponds to the decay of a molecule, or the
formation of a new one. The choice of coordinates in the lunar problem is entirely suitable if S represents an atom that scatters off the
molecule TL. The result of such an interaction depends, of course, on
the value of the total angular momentum and of the total energy, although their values remain the same throughout the whole event.
Celestial mechanics stays entirely within the confines of classical
mechanics, whereas molecular mechanics requires that the system be
viewed in the light of quantum mechanics. In addition, the motion of
the nuclei in a molecule can only be fully treated by solving
Schrodinger's equation. Since our understanding of quantum mechanics is based on the experience of classical mechanics, however, we gain
a great deal of insight by studying some of the most instructive problems in celestial mechanics. They are also accessible to our daily observation if we are willing to watch the sky occasionally and notice
some of its most obvious changes.

4.3 The Action-Angle Variables in the Lunar Observations
This section sketches the traditional view of the three-body problem
under the assumption (as yet to be proved correct) that it is integrable.
The Moon-Earth-Sun problem has been understood in this manner
since time immemorial, and provides a highly non-trivial example
where precise data have been available to be examined from different
viewpoints.
What would be the consequences if there existed four more constants of motion to take care of the remaining four degrees of freedom?
The remaining four degrees of freedom would behave essentially as
four masses which are coupled by linear springs; there would be four
independent harmonic motions. The movements in the three-body
problem could be represented as a Fourier expansion exactly as in the
formula (3.4) with the help of four frequencies. The numerical values
of these frequencies depend on the initial conditions, but they remain
constant in time. This state of affairs has been well understood from
observation at least since 3000 years, going back to Babylonia.
The four relevant frequencies, or their periods, are conveniently
measured in terms of the Earth's rotation, say in mean solar days,

4.3 Action-Angle Variables in Lunar Observations

51

which are largely independent of the translatory motions of Moon,
Earth, and Sun. Thus, we have the following periods (cf. Allen 1962):
(a) the sidereal year To describing the Sun's yearly motion
through the sky from a given fixed star back to the same star in
365.257 days, which is about 20 minutes longer than the tropical
year, from equinox to equinox;
(b) the sidereal month T 1 of 27.32166 days taking the moon
from a fixed star back to the same fixed star; by combining the
sidereal year with the sidereal month one gets the better known
synodic month of 29.53059 days, which takes our satellite from
one full moon to the next;
c) the anomalistic month T2 of 27.55455 days for the moon to
complete its 'anomaly' (speeding up and slowing down) from one
perigee, point of closest approach to the Earth, to the next;
d) the draconitic or nodical month T3 of 27.21222 days, which
takes the moon from one ascending (or descending) node, i.e.,
intersection with the ecliptic where it might get eaten by the
dragon in an eclipse, to the next.
The values of these periods were known to the Greeks correctly with
the accuracy quoted, corresponding to 1 second of time. These numbers constitute the first high precision results in the physical sciences.
The four periods are obtained by keeping careful records over long
times; watching the Sun set on the horizon in early spring, and waiting
till he sets exactly on the same spot over and over again, will eventually
yield a good value for the tropical year. The reader should try to imagine what kind of observations will give the lunar periods.
Each period 1j (and the corresponding frequency w; = 2'1T I Tj)
gives rise to an angular variable w; in the three-body problem, exactly
as it was explained in Section 3. 3. The coordinates of the Moon with
respect to the Earth are, therefore, given by Fourier expansions like
(3.4). The angle variables, however, do not appear as if by magic out
of some general algorithm, but they arise out of a well-defined view of
the problem at hand. In the lunar motion, the astronomical observations naturally suggest the angles that are associated with the primary
periods. Similarly in chemistry, a particular model of the molecular
motion in terms of bond angles and bond stretches leads usually to the
good choice of variables.
The leading terms in the expansion (3.4) of the Moon's coordinates
(x, y, z) with respect to the Earth can be interpreted geometrically. If
(x, y) are chosen to lie in the ecliptic with the Earth at the origin, the
most important term in (3.4) is a circular motion of radius a whose

52

The Three-Body Problem: Moon - Earth - Sun

period is the sidereal month T1. The next term increases and decreases
the radius of this circular motion in the (x, y) plane sinusoidally at the
rhythm of the anomalistic month T2 ; its amplitude is a fraction
2e ~ 1/9 of the radius a ; this fraction e is essentially twice the eccentricity of the Moon's trajectory. The leading term in the motion along
the z-axis (at right angle to the ecliptic) varies sinusoidally as the period
of the draconitic month T3, with an amplitude k~ 1/11 compared with
the radius a of the basic circular motion, corresponding to the inclination ~so of the lunar trajectory.
The coefficients in these three basic terms determine the values of
the actions that are associated with the angles. In a preliminary explanation, T1 is associated with the 'binding energy' between Moon and
Earth, T2 with their relative angular momentum, and T3 with its component at right angles to the ecliptic. The fourth angle Wo gives the
mean yearly motion of the Earth-Moon around the Sun, whose mean
distance a' yields the fourth action.
Many other, and generally smaller, terms are added to these four
basic terms in the Fourier expansions (3.4); their frequencies are
combinations of the four basic ones. The problem is to find the exact
values for the coefficients of these higher terms. Since the values of the
four action variables are essentially determined by the four basic terms,
all the coefficients of the higher terms are functions of these four basic
ones. There is no room for fudging anything: Newton was the first to
recognize clearly the existence of no more than four parameters besides
the mass ratios and the values of the obvious constants of motion like
the total angular momentum; he tried to obtain the coefficients of the
higher terms in (3.4) from the knowledge of the lowest four. But he
was not always beyond claiming that some coefficient had been calculated when, in fact, he had gotten it from fitting the data.
In the interest of simplifying the calculations, we will assume that
r moves around the Sun in the ecliptic on a fixed Kepler ellipse with
known semimajor axis a' and eccentricity e'. This is a very good approximation since the solar mass exceeds the combined mass of Earth
and Moon by a factor of more than 300,000.
The polar angle of r as seen from the Sun is written as
cp 1 = g' + f ', where g' is the direction of the perihelion as referred to
the spring equinox. The true anomaly!' differs from the mean anomaly f' by the expansion (cf. Brouwer and Clemence 1961, Chapter II).

All the quantities referring to the Sun appear primed in accord with
the traditions of celestial mechanics so that the analogous quantities for
the Moon can remain unprimed.
The mean angular speed
n' = w0 = 2rr /To , also called the Sun's mean motion, is related to the
semimajor axis a' by Kepler's third law,
n' 2a' 3 = G(S + T + L) .
(4.6)
The Moon-Earth-S un problem has now been reduced from four to
three and one-half degrees of freedom, in the slightly facetious language of the practitioners in this trade. On the one hand, the movement
of r around the Sun is no longer influenced by the internal complications between the Earth and the Moon; on the other, these internal
motions are subject to the periodically changing distance of r from the
Sun. The angle is what is left over from the angle-variable w0 ; it has
been reduced to the role of a sinusoidally varying external perturbation
of known period To as in (3.5). We are left with the three action-angle
variables corresponding to the periods T1 , T2 , T3 •

4.4 The Best Temporary Fit to a Kepler Ellipse
The location of the Moon as seen from the Earth at any instant t is
determined in the following manner, which is basically the classic
Greek description in modern form. The angular momentum of the
Moon with respect to the Earth defines a direction in space, and an
instantaneous orbital plane at right angles to it, which intersects the
ecliptic in the nodal line and is inclined at an angle y. The energy of
the Moon-Earth system defines an instantaneous semimajor axis a, and
the absolute value of the angular momentum determines an instantaneous eccentricity e. The angle from the reference direction in the
ecliptic to the ascending node is called h; the angle from the ascending
node to the instantaneous perigee is g; and the angle from the instantaneous perigee to the Moon is called f, corresponding to the true
anomaly.
There is an advantage in using the mean anomaly f instead of [with
the help of the relation (4.3), but this time for the unprimed quantities.
The instantaneous coordinates a, e, y, h, g, fare completely equivalent

54

The Three-Body Problem: Moon- Earth- Sun

to the six Cartesian components of p = (u, v, w) and r = (x, y, z). They
provide the best temporary fit of the real motion with the motion on a
Kepler ellipse, and are called the osculating elements. A perspective
drawing of this traditional picture for the Moon's trajectory is presented in Figure 6.
If it were not for the presence of the Sun the angles g and h would
remain constant, while eincreases linearly in time exactly as in formula
(4.4). The rate of increase n is 2'TT divided by the sidereal month T 1, and
is related to the semimajor axis a again by Kepler's third law
n 2a 3 = G(T + L) .

e,

(4.7)

The six quantities g, h, a, e, y can be grouped in canonically conjugate pairs, called Delaunay coordinates, as follows: A = J.Lna 2 with f,
M= J.Lna 2 (1- e 2 ) 112 withg, andN= Mcosywithh. Slightlyclumsy
expressions for A, M, Nhave been used to show that they have indeed
the physical dimension of an angular momentum or action, ready to
become multiples of Planck's quantum if we want to quantize the motion.
With the momentum p = (u, v, w), and the position r = (x,y, z),
udx + vdy + wdz = Adf +
one has the mathematical identity
Mdg + Ndh, which is rather troublesome to derive, although it is simply
a consequence of the definition for A, M, etc. A careful stepwise proof
was found by Whittaker, and is also given in the textbook of Brouwer
and Clemence (1961, p. 279); the same result is derived in modern
terminology by Abraham and Marsden (1978, p. 638).
If the Sun did not disturb the Earth and the Moon, A, M, N, as well
as g and h would not change with time, and we would have a Kepler
motion. If the effect of the Sun is small, the values of A, M, N vary
slowly; also the angles f, g, h vary almost exactly as linear functions
of time, g and h rather slowly compared with e.
Humanity has known for over 3000 years that h decreases by 2'TT in
about 18 years, while the sum h + g increases by 2'TT in about 9 years.
The reader is encouraged to imagine how our ancestors were able to
determine these facts without any instruments whatever, simply by
keeping careful records of the events in the sky! The mean rates of
change for h and h + g follow directly from the various periods in
Section 4.3. The main ingredients are the differences of the draconitic
month and of the anomalistic month with the sidereal month; they are
- 2 hours 37 minutes 29 seconds and + 5 hours 35 minutes 29 seconds, again known to this precision by the Greeks.
Until Newton no astronomer even suggested any reason for the slow
change in h and h +g. It was accepted as an observational result, and
since the moon's motion could not be explained without it, the planets
were allowed to show similar slow migrations in their nodes and

Figure 6 The traditional representation of the Moon's motion around the
Earth: the x , y-plane is the ecliptic (plane of the Earth's orbit around the
Sun); the orbital plane of the Moon (dashed lines) intersects the ecliptic in the
nodal line at the angle of inclination y; the Moon moves on a Kepler ellipse
around the Earth whose point of closest approach (perigee) is at the angular
distance g away from the node; the node moves backwards while the perigee
moves forwards at roughly twice the speed, covering a full circle in about nine
years.

perihelia, although they turned out to be extremely small. Kepler's
Rudolphine tables are constructed exactly on this model, but using the
formulas (4.3), (4.4), and (4.5) instead of the earlier epicycles and
eccentric circles of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe.
Even this simple scheme based on the uniform change of the
osculating elements with t does not do justice to the motion of the
Moon. Ptolemy already had discovered a correction to the Moon's
longitude cp = h + g + f, called the evection; for the first time in science, it was found necessary to combine two different harmonic
motions because of their non-linear coupling; a short explanation of
this extraordinary discovery is quite in order.
The main difference between the true anomaly f and the mean
anomaly f is given by the first term in the expansion (4.3), namely
2e sin f, where in angular units 2e ~ 375' for the Moon. The evection
introduces a further correction to the mean anomaly which combines
f and the mean angular distance D from the Sun to the Moon,
sin(2D - f), with an amplitude ~ 75'. Notice that the second cor-

56

The Three-Body Problem: Moon - Earth - Sun

rection is opposite to the first when D = 0 (new moon) or D = 'TT (full
moon), whereas the two corrections add constructively when
D = 'TT 12 (both half-moons). The swing of the Moon away from its
mean position amounts, therefore, to ~ ± 300' = ± 5° in the new
and full moons, whereas in the half moons it goes up to
~ ± 450' = 7.5°, a large effect, which is not noticed if only the lunar
and solar eclipses are used as empirical data.
Ptolemy explained this marvelous observation with his crank model
which, indeed, gives the correct time dependence for the polar coordinates of the Moon. Unfortunately, this model implies that the Moon's
distance from the earth at half moon is only about half of what it is at
new moon or full moon; the Moon's apparent size would then be about
twice at half moon what it is at new moon or full moon, which is not
correct, as everybody knows. It is the great merit of Copernicus to
have replaced Ptolemy's pseudo-mechanical device by the more abstract, but very general Fourier expansion (3.4).
The principal challenge of celestial mechanics beyond the explanation of Kepler's laws is to account for the drift in the Moon's perigee
and node. Newton solved the problem as well as he could without the
use of extensive algebraic manipulations. He found that the nodical
month is shorter than the sidereal month by the fraction 3n' 2I 4n 2 , and
that the anomalistic month is longer by the same fraction. The utter
simplicity of this result is impressive, and is only marred by the fact that
the second fraction is too small by a factor of 2. This discrepancy was
finally explained after Newton's death by Clairaut and d' Alembert using a computational tour de force (for a full historical account cf. Waff
1975, 1976, 1977); but as mentioned earlier, it was left to Hill to find
a simple convincing physical picture.

4.5 The Time-Dependent Hamlltonian
The Moon circles around the Earth as its main center of attraction with
the Sun very far away. In practical terms, the distance R in the
Hamiltonian ( 4.2) is larger than r by a factor of 400. Therefore, the
first two terms in the potential energy are expanded in the ratio rI R.
If we retain only the lowest order beyond the inverse first powers of
Rand r, we get the potential energy

57

The first term in the kinetic energy of ( 4.2) and the first term in the
potential energy of (4.8) yield the Hamiltonian for the Kepler ellipse
of the Earth-Moon center of mass r around the Sun. This motion is
described very closely by the formulas (4.3), (4.4), and (4.5) with
Kepler's third law (4.6). As was already explained at the end of Section 4.2, one of the four degrees of freedom in the three-body problem
is taken away by assuming that the position vector R depends on time
exactly as given in (4.3) through (4.6). We are, therefore, left with the
second term in the kinetic energy of ( 4.2), and the remainder of the
potential energy ( 4.8) where R and R are to be replaced by their expressions (4.3) through (4.6).
The Moon's motion around the Earth in terms of the momentum p

where we have used Kepler's third laws (4.6) and (4.7) to get rid of the
masses and the gravitational constant G. Also a correction (T + L)/ S
has been neglected compared with 1 at this stage of the development.
The influence of the Sun on the motion of the Moon around the
Earth has been reduced to a simple quadrupole tem1 whose size, however, depends on the distance R of the Sun, and the relative angle between Sun and Moon as seen from the Earth. Thus, we have a
time-dependent Hamiltonian, and the energy is not conserved; the
frequency of this time-dependence n' is small compared with the frequency n of the Moon's orbit; we have n' In = sidereal month I year
"' 1/13. The quadrupolar term in (4.9) is smaller than the Earth's attraction by the square of this quantity, or about 1/180.
Further terms in the expansion of the solar perturbation decrease
with ever higher powers of the ratio rI R, or equivalently a/ a' which is
of the order 1I 400. As stated here, the time-dependent Hamiltonian
(4.5) with its higher order terms in powers of a/a' constitutes the socalled main problem of lunar theory, whose solution accounts correctly
for all the peculiarities of the Moon's motion. A systematic introduction to lunar theory was written by Brown (1896, 1960). It is surprising that such apparently small corrections to the Hamiltonian of a very
well-behaved mechanical system lead to a complex motion.

CHAPTER 5

Three Methods of Solution

The search for a general method to solve problems in mechanics is a
worthy endeavor; but the experience of two centuries shows that there
is no such thing as a universal recipe, in particular now, when chaos has
been recognized as an inevitable and even typical occurrence. The
three methods to be discussed have each their advantages over the
other two: Lagrange's variation of the constants provides a direct interpretation of the underlying physics; canonical transformations deal
effectively with systems that are assumed to be integrable; Hill's
method explores the neighborhood of an isolated periodic orbit. The
emphasis is on the last because it is the least known and perhaps the
best for understanding a limited portion of phase space. The example
of the Moon's motion not only provides the first detailed application,
but also gives a vivid picture of the ideas behind the mathematical
formalism.

5.1 Variation of the Constants (Lagrange)
Lagrange was the first mathematical physicist to search consistently for
underlying principles and to strive for the most economical and elegant
solutions. He found a general method for solving the problems of celestial mechanics; it incorporates the description of the solar system
that had been in use since antiquity. The basic pattern such as the
Kepler ellipse is maintained, but it is allowed to modify and adjust itself

Three Methods of Solution

59

under the influence of the perturbations from third, fourth, etc. bodies.
These modifications and adjustments take place slowly compared with
the motion in the basic pattern. They are defined in terms of the parameters that determine the basic pattern, namely the constants of
motion such as the semimajor axis a, the eccentricity e, the inclination
of the orbit y, the direction of the ascending node h, the direction of the
perigee h + g, and the mean anomaly f 0 at the epoch.
Instead of solving the equations of motion for the coordinates of the
body in some arbitrary reference system, one establishes equations for
the change with time of the parameters a, e, y, h, g, and f 0 . These
equations take the general form
da
de
dt = Ka(a, e, y, f O• g, h) , dt = Ke(a, e, y, f 0 , g, h) , etc. (5.1)
where the functions Ka , Ke , etc. contain only terms that come from the
perturbations. While the idea is straightforward, it took the prodigious
skill of Lagrange to give an efficient scheme for calculating these
functions. In this context he invented the device of using what are now
called the Lagrange brackets, the forerunners and actually the inverses
of the Poisson brackets.
The reader is invited to spend an enjoyable few hours studying this
method in the standard textbooks, provided the explanation of the
method is followed by a non-trivial example. The textbook of Brouwer
and Clemence ( 1961, Chapter XI) gives a self-contained presentation
of Lagrange's formalism.
Just looking at the right-hand sides of the equations (5.1) conveys
a lot of physics, because the causes for the change in the parameters
are immediately visible, and the extent of these changes can be estimated. Nevertheless, Lagrange's method has severe limitations in the
case of the Moon. Some parameters such as a may remain nearly
constant, while others such as e vary by almost a factor of 2; the main
culprit in this case is the evection which was discussed at the end of the
last chapter. Figure 7 shows the variation of the Moon's eccentricity
with time, and demonstrates that Lagrange's idea does not work well.
Finally, h and g increase indefinitely with time, rather than varying
around a constant mean value and become very tricky to handle.

5.2 Canonical Transformations (Delaunay)
Canonical coordinates in phase space were briefly discussed at the beginning of Section 2.2; now we shall consider more closely how they
can be adapted to the solution of a particular problem. Canonical

time: the abscissa gives the time in synodic months starting with the year 1980

traditional picture of the Moon's orbit is not good.

transformations were invented by Hamilton in the first half of the
nineteenth century, when he tried to find a new formalism for what
we now call geometric optics. The basic ideas were then found to work
for mechanics as well, and were elaborated by Jacobi. Eventually, they
found their justification almost a century later in wave mechanics,
which is very close to wave optics.
This explanation for the importance of canonical transformations
in mechanics is well known, but it seems to imply that quantum mechanics is always lurking in the background, even when we deal with
celestial mechanics where we can certainly do without Planck's quantum. Canonical transformations may just be one of several useful systematic procedures for solving problems in classical mechanics, but not
the only one as it would appear from its presentation in many textbooks, to the exclusion of other methods.
The first large-scale application of canonical transformations was
carried out by Charles Delaunay who set out in 1846 to solve the main
problem of lunar theory as defined in the last chapter. His was a lonely
and monumental endeavor, which ended in the publication of two large
volumes in quarto of about 900 pages each as Memoires of the (then)
Imperial Academy of Sciences of France, 1860 and 1867. We will re-

5.2 Canonical Transformations (Delaunay)

61

view his work briefly because it reveals the first indications of chaos,
and the consequent limitations on this kind of effort. It also shows very
clearly the appearance of the small denominators that again get us
closer to the questions concerned with integrability.
Delaunay starts with the action-angle variables for the two-body
problem which were explained in Section 4.4; the actions are A, M, and
N, while the angles are f, g, and h. The Hamiltonian without the perturbation has the somewhat unlikely form H = - p.(GTL) 2 /2A 2 ,
where p. is the reduced mass TL/(T + L) . This expression takes care
of the first two terms in the full Hamiltonian (4.9). The Bohr formula
in atomic physics is obtained if one makes the following replacements:
p. is the mass of the electron, GTL is the square of the electronic charge,
and A is a multiple of Planck's constant divided by 2'1T. The remainder
of (4.9) constitutes the perturbation where we now have to replace the
position coordinates (x, y, z) by their expressions in terms of
A, M, N, f, g, and h.
That replacement is already a major enterprise which we will not try
to carry out here. The new expression for the perturbation depends
explicitly on time through the time dependence of the solar coordinates
R which follows from the formulas (4.3) through (4.6). The
Hamiltonian can be made formally time-independent if we use the
fourth angular variable k = f', and the corresponding action variable
K, and if we add a term n'K to the Hamiltonian, so that
H = -

p.(GTL) 2

,

+ n K + F(A, M, N; k, f, g, h),

(5.2)

where the function F represents the perturbation corresponding to the
last term in (4.9) and does not contain the action variable K.
This little maneuver puts us back where we started, when we
counted a total of four degrees of freedom in the three-body problem
after eliminating the obvious constants of motion. The somewhat artificial occurrence of the fourth action-angle pair (K, k) in this
Hamiltonian expresses the reduction from 4 to 3 1 I 2 degrees of freedom,
which was mentioned at the end of Section 4.3.
The perturbation F has to be expanded, exactly as V(q, t) in (3.6),
into a multiple Fourier series in the angles k, f, g, and h. The coefficients depend on A, M, and N through the small parameters
m = n'/n, e, y, e', and a/a', as well as the mass ratios L/T, and
(T+ L)/S.
The values of these parameters are about 1/13, 1/10, 1/20, 1/60,
and 1/400, as well as 1/80, and 1/330,000: small enough to suggest
a power series expansion for each coefficient in the Fourier series of
F. Delaunay carries out this expansion in algebraic form, keeping ev-

62

erywhere rational numbers! It is not as easy to carry out this tedious
work on a modern computer as the reader might think. Barton ( 1966
and 1967) tried to duplicate Delaunay's work and barely succeeded in
reproducing the function F, but he was not able to carry out the next
and more difficult step.
Delaunay retains 461 terms in the Fourier expansion of F; the coefficients are polynomials in the various small parameters, some of
which cover several pages. He proceeds systematically to get rid of one
term after another, each time using a canonical transformation adapted
to the particular term to be eliminated.

5.3 The Application of Canonical Transformations
The construction of such a transformation will now be demonstrated
because it will show exactly in what form the solution of the threebody problem can be obtained in this standard procedure. After each
transformation the old set of actions (ft, h. h) and angles
( w1, w2 , W:3) is expressed in terms of a new set of actions (J1 , 12 , J 3 ) and
angles (u 1, u2 , u3 ) . As explained already in Section 2.2, the transforbe
defined

can
W(J1, 12 , 13 , w0 , w1 , W2. w3 ) where w0 = u0 coincides always with the
mean anomaly of the Sun f', also called k in the preceding section. The
transformation is given by the formulas
Ii =

ui =

These formulas are applied to the old Hamiltonian
H = HoUt, /2, /3)

+ eV(/1, / 2 , / 3 ) cos(mow0 + m 1w1 + ~w2 + m3w3 + cp).

(5.3)

(5.4)

All terms have been neglected except the ones that no longer depend
on the angle variables, and the one special term of the perturbation that
the transformation is designed to eliminate; it is characterized by the
quadruple of integers (m 0 , m 1, m2, m 3) and the real coefficient
e V(ft, h. h), where the factor e has been inserted to show its magnitude relative to the first term in (5.4). In general, the expansion (3.5)
has complex coefficients; the argument of the cosine in (5.4) contains,
therefore, a phase cp which depends on the multi-index
(m 0 , m 1, m2 , m3 ). In the case of the lunar problem, however, the symmetry of the perturbation makes this phase vanish and yields the formula (5.4) with cp = 0.
The generating function W is chosen so that the new Hamiltonian,

5.3 The Application of Canonical Transformations

aw

H' = H + -

dt

'

63
(5.5)

has no term in cos(mowo + m 1w1 + m 2W2 + m3W3) any longer; but in
making the replacements of I and w by J and u , many other terms arise.
If the consecutive elimination of terms is properly managed, however,
the new terms are of higher order, and have more complicated angular
arguments. The transformation has to be applied to all the terms in the
complete Hamiltonian, not only to the particular term that appears in
(5.4), before the next transformation can be carried out.
W is now set up in the form
W = Jlwl + J2w2 + J3w3 + eU(Jl, J2, J3, Wo, Wt, w2, w3)' (5.6)
which can be inserted into the formulas (5.3), and from there into (5.4)
and (5.5) where one expands in powers of e. The elimination of the
term in cos(mowo + mtWt + m2W2 + m3 WJ) leads to a first-order linear
partial differential equation for the function U, which is easily solved
in the form
U = - U(J1, J2, J 3 ) sin(mow0 + m 1w1 + ~w2 + ~w3 ), (5.7)
with the function U given by the equation
V(Jt • J2, J3)
U(Jt> J2, J3) =
4 (mowo + mt"'t + ~"'2 + m3w3)

(5.8)

The frequencies w follow from the standard formula (3.3),
w; = <1Ho/ dJ; in terms of the angle-independent part H 0 (J1, h. J 3 ) in
(5.4); w0 is always the mean solar motion n'.

5.4 Small Denominators and Other Difficulties
In the solution (5.8) for U, the denominator in the generating function
(5. 7) is the cause of many difficulties. The division by a frequency
corresponds to an integration over time which averages the perturbation and has to be carried out in one form or another in any solution;
the problem of small denominators is unavoidable. In our case, w1 is
close to n, corresponding to the sidereal month; w0 equals n', corresponding to the sidereal year, and therefore smaller than w 1 by a factor
m = n' /nor about 1/13; w3 is the motion of the node, which is close
to- 3n12 /4n according to Newton, and a factor 3m 2 /4~1/240 below
w 1; finally, the combination w 2 + w3 is the motion of the perigee, which
is the same up to its sign as w3 according to Newton, although it is actually twice as much when all the higher-order terms are included.

64

Three Methods of Solution

If a term in the perturbation has m 1= 0, it varies at a yearly rhythm;
it has, therefore, a small denominator which boosts its importance by
a factor of 13 compared with the monthly perturbations where
m1 ':/: 0. If both mo = 0 and m1 = 0, the boost is of the order 240.
Finally, since w2 and w3 are empirically of the order of 3:1 with a
change in sign, one has the exceptional case where m 0 = m1 = 0 and
m3 = 3m2, which gives a boost of 2000.
The effect of such small denominators is partially offset by the
smallness of the perturbing term with that frequency. There is usually
a direct relation, called the d'Alembert property, between the integers
m; and the powers of the expansion parameters m, e, y, e', and ala',
which reduces the absolute value of the resonant perturbations.
Poincare (1908) gave a thorough discussion of this problem for the
lunar theory, which has recently been taken up by Kovalewsky (1982);
again Brouwer and Clemence ( 1961, p.317) provide a good first glance
at the problem.
Two more comments are in order before we come to the discussion
of Delaunay's results. The various frequencies in the lunar motion have
empirical values, and we know nothing about their numerical character,
rational, algebraic, or transcendental. Theorems about the convergence of expansions that are based on the number-theoretical nature
of competing frequencies are, therefore, of little use. On the other
hand, as the solution to the problem develops, one obtains a power series expansion with rational coefficients for the frequencies in terms
of the small parameters in the problem; in our case, it is mainly the
expansion in m = n' In which determines the resonances.
The occurrence of a resonance corresponds to the division by such
a small parameter; the original ordering of the terms in the perturbation
is obviated thereby. It is exactly this phenomenon which prevented
Barton from carrying out Delaunay's solution on a computer of moderate size in the late 1960s, and inspired Deprit, Henrard, and Rom
( 1971) to try an entirely different approach yielding the same solution.
Their method uses the so-called Lie series which had been known by
some specialists but were not adapted to celestial mechanics until independently by Hori (1966) and Deprit (1969). Unfortunately, this
calculation for the Moon has not been reported in its entirety because,
with the coefficients in the expansion kept as rational numbers and the
expansion carried to the order required by modern observations, the
total output is huge.
Delaunay carried out a sequence of 505 canonical transformations,
choosing terms in the perturbation to be eliminated according to his
best guess about their importance. Thus, he went to the ninth order in
m, but that yielded only the fourth decimal in the motion of the perigee

5.4 Small Denominators and Other Difficulties

65

while the Greeks already knew five decimals. The reason for this failure
is the same which had defeated Newton; when the motion of the
perigee g + h and the motion of the node h are expanded to higher
powers in m , the first two terms of this expansion are,

as first found by Clairaut and d'Alembert.
Newton was completely correct as far as the first term in each expansion is concerned, but he did not know that the second terms would
be so vastly different. The coefficients in the first series keep on
growing at about the above rate, while those in the second series decrease and alternate. Both series converge for the relevant value of
m~l/13, but the first does so quite poorly. Schmidt (1979) has obtained over 30 terms for a precision of 10 decimals, but his coefficients
are given as real numbers rather than rationals. Estimates of the higher
order terms in expansions of this kind have been discussed among
others by Bogomolnyi (1984a and b) as well as Llave and Rana (1989).

5.5 Hill's Periodic Orbit in the Three-Body Problem
The main idea of Hill's approach can be explained in relatively few
words, and this very simplicity shows how radically different his
method was from all its predecessors. Lagrange, Delaunay, and the
other celestial mechanicians started from the Kepler ellipses, which are
the most general solutions of the two-body problem, and modified
them so as to accommodate the effect of the third body in the problem.
Hill identifies a very special, but relatively simple solution of the full
three-body problem, and then constructs the other solutions in the
neighborhood of the particular one.
The special solution is a periodic orbit by which we mean that the
trajectory closes itself smoothly, and the body keeps running around
the same track indefinitely (cf. Section 1.2). Hill's original paper was
first published separately in the USA (1877), and then reprinted in
Acta Mathematica 1886; this work and the second series of articles
(1878) are best available in the Collected Works (1905, p.243 and
284). They are quite readable. There are many other accounts in the
textbooks and treatises on celestial mechanics, such as Brown ( 1896,
1960), and Poincare (1907), as well as Brouwer and Clemence (1961).

66

Three Methods of Solution

The Kepler ellipses are periodic orbits; but the Moon's trajectory
as it has been described since antiquity is not periodic, because both its
perigee and its node rotate at rates that are not commensurate with its
monthly circuit around the Earth. Periodic orbits in the full three-body
problem are difficult to find, and Hill's choice is neither obvious nor
easy to calculate. Its construction requires that one work in a special
coordinate system in the ecliptic which had already been used in one
of Euler's contributions to lunar theory.
The remainder of this chapter may be frustrating to the reader, because its pace seems slow. There are two separate endeavors both of
which require special care: on the one hand, all equations are written
in such a way that only the essential variables are left to deal with, and
can be interpreted directly in terms of observations; on the other, the
crucial first steps, in a long series of similar ones, are explained in sufficient detail to clearly perceive how the procedure is continued. Hill's
method and its development by Brown (1897 to 1908) and Eckert
(1966, 1967) are designed to construct directly the invariant tori
without the usual perturbation approach starting from the Kepler ellipses.
The starting point is the Hamiltonian (4.9) with an additional simplification: the trajectory of the Earth-Moon around the Sun is assumed to be a circle, or in other words, a Kepler ellipse with the
eccentricity e' = 0. The vector R in the ecliptic has a constant length
a', and rotates at the constant rate n' around the Sun, exactly as in the
formulas (4.3) and (4.4) withe' = 0.
The new coordinate system of the Moon (x, y, z), with the (x, y) in
the ecliptic, is still centered in the Earth; but it rotates at the uniform
speed n', so that the Sun is always seen in the x-direction. The
Hamiltonian becomes

where the momentum of the Moon has the Cartesian components
(u, v, w) in the rotating frame of reference. The complete Hamiltonian
in this coordinate system has many more terms, all of which, however,
are proportional to powers of e' and a/ a' . The distance of the Sun a'
does not appear in (5.11) although the effect of the Sun is certainly
represented in the last term, the quadrupole potential of the Sun in the
neighborhood of the Earth.
The individual terms in this Hamitonian can be interpreted as if we
were dealing with atomic physics: let JL be the mass of an electron, and

5.5 Hill's Periodic Orbit in the Three-Body Problem

the product f.Ln 2a3 equal to the square of the electronic charge E 2 . Then
the frequency n 1 becomes the Larmor frequency in the magnetic field
B through the formula n1 = EBI2f.Lc with the speed of light c. Without
the two terms in n 12 we have the Hamiltonian of a hydrogen atom in a
magnetic field, a problem to which we will devote Chapter 18, because
it is an ideal case of a mildly chaotic system. The magnetic field is very
strong since the Larmor frequency n 1 forms with the orbital frequency
n the ratio m = n 1In~ 1I 13; such a ratio corresponds to a Zeeman energy of 1 e V if the atom is in its ground state, or a magnetic field of
10,000 Tesla, far beyond anything technically available at present. If
one deals with a Rydberg atom, however, where the outermost electron
is in a very highly excited state, e.g., in a state with the principal quantum number 100, the magnetic field for n1 In~ 1 I 13 reduces to a manageable 1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss.
The two terms in n12 add an 'electrostatic' potential with a parabolic
shape, negative in the x-direction, neutral in they-direction, and positive in the z-direction. The origin of this peculiar destabilizing force is
easy to understand: the centrifugal force acts to drive the Moon away
in the x-direction, but the solar attraction tends to pull the Moon toward the Earth along the z-axis. As a net result one finds the equations
of motion in the rotating frame,

where the dot indicates differentiation with respect to time t. On the

force, while on the right is the gravitational attraction of the Earth on
the Moon, and the solar quadrupole force. No masses appear any
longer, only the frequencies nand n1 , which are extremely well known
from observation, and the dimensionless distance rIa of the Moon
from the Earth.
The periodic orbit we are looking for is a solution of the equations
(5.12) with the imposed period of 29.53059 days corresponding to the
synodic month, from full moon to full moon, or equivalently, with a
frequency n - n1 • Therefore, we use the parameter T = (n - n 1 )t,
which is the mean angle from the Sun to the Moon as seen from the
Earth, and we construct a solution of (5.12) with the period 21T in the

68

variable r. Moreover, we restrict the periodic orbit to the ecliptic, i.e.,

z = 0, and expand in a complex-valued Fourier series

As further requirement on the periodic orbit, we demand symmetry
with respect to the x-axis in the form
x0 ( - r) + 1)10 ( - r) = [.xo(r) + iy0 (r)]+ ,
(5.14)
where the upper index+ indicates the complex conjugate. The coefficients ap are real because of (5.14), and conversely, the symmetry of
the periodic orbit is assured when the coefficients ae are real.
Since the solar potential is approximated by a quadrupole field,
there is also symmetry with respect to the origin, and we can require
that xo( r + 'TT') + iyo( r + 'TT') = - (xo( r) + iyo( r)) which implies that
all the odd coefficients a 2 e + 1 = 0. The periodic orbit has the shape
of an oval which is centered on the origin, and intersects the x-axis and
they-axis at right angles.
If the Sun is not pushed off to infinity with an infinite mass to make
up for the distance, then the disturbing potential is not symmetric with
respect to the y-axis, although it remains so with respect to the x-axis.
The periodic orbit loses its symmetry correspondingly, and one needs
both even and odd coefficients ae.
The equations (5.12) in terms of the variable r contain only the parameter m = n' In and the normalized coordinates (x0 + iy0 ) I a. Thus
one obtains a one-parameter family of ovals, which are sketched in
Figure 8 for different values of m. We see that if the Moon had a
synodic period of about 210 days, or seven calendar months, or a little
less than eight sidereal months, her orbit would have a stationary point
with respect to the Sun at half moon. According to a rough estimate
using Kepler's third law for the Earth-Moon system (4.7), a reduction
of the mean motion n by a factor of 8 would be compensated by an
increase of the semimajor axis a by a factor of 4. The Moon would still
be close to the Earth relative to the Sun since the ratio a/ a' would be
about 1/100.
As long as the Moon's orbit does not deviate too much from a circle,
or equivalently, provided the term with f = 0 in (5.13) is dominant,
Hill's periodic orbit can be roughly estimated. Let us, therefore, insert
x = a0 cos(r),y = ao sin(r),z = 0 into (5.12). The first and second
equations become incompatible; by multiplying the first with cos( r),
the second with sin( r), and adding, we get the radial aceleration on the
left and the radial force on the right. Both sides are then integrated
over r from 0 to 2'TT' to equate the average radial acceleration with the
average radial force. Thus, we find that

the average distance of the Moon from the Earth has actually decreased
compared with its Keplerian value. The Moon has to come closer to
the Earth in order to maintain her frequency in spite of the Sun, which
tries to tear the Moon away from the Earth.
The complete solution for the periodic orbit, i.e., 1the coefficients ae
in (5.13), have to be obtained before one can go on to find the general
solution of the equations ( 5.12) in its neighborhood. The ideal method
is to write the coefficients as power series in the parameter m = n/ n';
we shall assume that this feat has been completed with the help of some
of the ingenious algorithms which we owe to Hill (1878), Poincare
(1907), and others.

5.6 The Motion of the Perigee and of the Node
The Moon does not move on Hill's periodic orbit, not even in the rotating frame; but since she is never far from such a special solution of
the equations of motion, her trajectory can be found by looking at the
motions that differ only by small displacements from the periodic orbit.
The equations (5.12) are, therefore, linearized around the periodic orbit (xo(t),yo(t), 0); the result is written in terms of the displacements

where the dots again indicate differentiation with respect to time t and
r0 = (x3 +yo) 112 . These equations are a special case of ( 1.17).
The equations are decoupled into the displacements in the ecliptic
(8x, 8y, 0), and the displacement normal to the ecliptic (0, 0, 8z). Since
the periodic orbit lies in the ecliptic so that z0 = 0, the value of the
Hamiltonian (5.11) does not depend on 8z to first order; a solution of
the last equation (5.16) by itself is acceptable. This condition for 8z is
already in the form of a typical Hill's equation, since we can write
2 3

0 =

8i+(~+n 12 )8z~8i+(n 2 + ~ n 12 )8z. (5.17)
ro

The factor of 8z in the second member is a function of period 2., in the
independent variable r because of r0 which is given by ( 5.13).
The third member in (5.17) uses the approximation (5.15) for the
periodic orbit as a circle with the radius r 0 = a0 . It has the solution
8z = K cos( wt + x) with the frequency w = n(l + 3n12 I 4n 2 ), which is
Newton's result for the motion of the node: The vertical motion of the
Moon in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit has a higher frequency,
so that the Moon returns to the ecliptic before she faces again the same
fixed star; her node is retrograde. The first part of (5.17) was obtained
and its consequences were discussed independently by J.C. Adams
(1878), the codiscoverer (with Leverrier) of the planet Neptune, at the
same time as Hill published his general method.
The equations for the deviations from the periodic orbit in the
ecliptic are more difficult to treat. They reflect accurately the problems

5.6 The Motion of the Perigee and of the Node

71

one encounters every time the neighborhood of a periodic orbit is investigated. There are two degrees of freedom since there are two position coordinates 8x and 8y ; but one degree of freedom is
uninteresting. A shift in the time variable by some constant value 8t
makes no difference to the trajectory of the Moon, and a shift by 8E
of the Moon's energy, i.e., the constant value of her Hamiltonian
(5.11), would change the frequency (n - n') of the periodic orbit.
The relevant degree of freedom is a shift 8s that is perpendicular in
the (x, y) plane to the direction of motion of the periodic orbit.
Therefore, we write
(8x, 8y)

<Yo,- .Xo)

8s -----:;:::=====:=::/. 2

. 2

(5.18)

V xo +Yo

and then find the original Hill's equation exactly as first written down
by its dicoverer,
8s + 8(t)8s = o ,
(5.19)

where the function e (t) has the period 21r I (n - n") of the periodic
orbit.
The calculation of 8 in terms of the coodinates x 0 (t) andy0 (t) can
be made by inserting the expression (5.18) into the equations (5.16);
but the necessary manipulations and the final result are surprisingly
tricky. In the limit of a circular periodic orbit with the radius r0 = a0
given by ( 5.15)' the time-independent part of e becomes
n 2 - 3n' 2 /2.
Just as in the case of 8z, we find now that
8s = E cos(Qt + 1/;) where Q = n(l - 3n' 2 I 4n 2 ), again Newton's result
for the motion of the Moon's anomaly, which is her motion toward and
away from the Earth.
The coefficients of the Fourier series ( 5.13) depend only on the
ratio m = n' In apart from some obvious scaling factors, and the same
holds for the periodic functions which appear in Hill's equations (5.17)
and ( 5.19). Various systematic procedures have been devised in order
to find directly the expansions (5.9) and (5.10) for the motions of the
node and of the perigee as power series in m. The most ingenious was
first proposed by Hill, and involves the use of infinite determinants, a
very daring idea at the time. These difficult series can thus be obtained,
without worrying about the effect of the other parameters such as the
e, y, e', and a/a'.

5. 7 Displacements from the Periodic Orbit and Hill's Equation
Hill's work has another aspect which is important for the sequel. The
solutions of (5.16), (5.17), and (5.19) obey Floquet's theorem (1883)
which was, of course, well understood by Hill five years earlier. They
consist of a product of two functions: the first factor is the simple
trigonometric function that we quoted earlier, and whose frequency
gives the motions of the node and of the perigee, called w and rl in the
preceding section. The second factor is periodic with the periodicity
of the underlying periodic orbit; the second factor provides only a
modulation of the amplitude for the first factor.
The symmetry of the periodic orbit suggests the following expression for the solutions of the equation (5.17):
. ( T ) = e ig0 TG( T ) - e -ig0TG+( T ) ,
(5.20)

and a slightly more complicated form for the equation (5.19):
X1(T) + iy1(T) = eicoTF1(T) + e-icoTF2 (T).

in terms of the mean synodic angle T = (n - n')t from the Sun to the
Moon. The functions G( T), F 1( T), and F 2 ( T) are periodic with the same
period 2'7T as the orbit (5.13), and can be expanded in the same manner
with real coefficients,
F 1(T) = 2>eeiPT, F2(T) = 2>'eeiPT, G(T) = 2>eeifT. (5.22)

The motion of the perigee (5.9) is given by 1 - (1 - m)co, and the
motion of the node (5.10) is 1 - (1 - m)g0 , because the coordinate
system for the periodic orbit is rotating with the angular speed
n(l - m) = n- n' , and the time parameter T has been normalized to
increase by 2'7T in one period.
The trajectory of the Moon can now be represented to first order
by adding the displacements (8x, 8y, 8z) to the coordinates (xo,Yo. 0)
of the periodic orbit. These displacements are the solutions of the
second-order linear equations (5.17) and (5.19), each of which has two
constants of integration. The most convenient choice for them are the
coefficients k = Ko for 8z, and the difference e = e0 - e' o for
8x + i8y, as well as a phase angle in each of the exponentials of (5.20)
and (5.21). The constant k defines the effective inclination of the lunar
trajectory with respect to the ecliptic, and the constant e determines its
effective eccentricity. The phase angles fix the position of the node and
of the perigee at the epoch.
By taking the time derivatives we get for the momentum (u, v, w)
as well as for the position (x, y, z) of the Moon formulas of the type
(3.4) which describe the motion on an invariant torus. There are alto-

gether three angle variables: the basic angle T in the periodic orbit and
in the functions F 1, F 2 of (5.21) and Gin (5.20), which describes the
synodic motion (with respect to the Sun); the angle coT for the anomaly toward and away from the Earth; the angle goT for the up and down
motion with respect to the ecliptic. A particular torus is characterized
by the effective eccentricity e and the inclination k.
Before concluding this chapter a few additional remarks about Hill's
method may help to gain perspective on his work. I find it surprising
that the trajectories in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit have frequencies that are completely different from the underlying period; after
all, one could have expected that the frequency differences vanish as
the trajectories get closer to their periodic progenitor, but the difference between the sidereal and the anomalistic month does not vanish
even when the eccentricity e goes to 0, and similarly with the nodical
month and the inclination k of the lunar trajectory.
The expansion around the periodic orbit can be pushed to higher
order in a fairly straightforward manner. Instead of expanding the
Hamiltonian or the equations of motion around the periodic orbit
(xo,Yo, 0), one expands around the first-order trajectory (xo + x 1,
y 0 + y 1, zJ), which is determined by the values of e and k. Second-order
corrections, ox= x2(T), oy =y2(T), oz = z2(T), now appear, which are
proportional to the small parameters e' and a/ a' , as well as to the
higher powers of e and k.
These corrections and all the subsequent ones satisfy linear differential equations whose only difference from (5.16) is the presence of
inhomogeneous driving terms on the right-hand side. They arise when
x = xo(T) + XJ(T), etc. are inserted into the Hamiltonian (5.11), and
its ancestors, (4.9) and (4.2). Each combination of small parameters
e, k, e', a/ a' leads to one such new set of inhomogeneous linear
equations. The whole expansion (3.4) for the lunar trajectory is found
by solving over and over again the same set of linear differential
equations (5.16).
This program was carried out around the turn of the century by
Brown (1897-1908), again by hand, with important technical improvements by Eckert (1954 ), and formed the basis for all lunar calculations before the landing of human beings on the Moon. By that
time modern computers had become available, which allowed all the
former computations to be pushed significantly beyond their original
goals. Dieter Schmidt of the University of Cincinnati and the author
(Gutzwiller and Schmidt 1986) completed in this manner the work that
had been started by Hill, and carried on by Brown and Eckert.
The resulting series for the Moon's invariant torus is useful as far
as practical calculations are concerned, but it has not been shown to

74

Three Methods of Solution

converge for the relevant choice of parameters. Moreover, the incipient chaos of the Moon's trajectory shows up even in this traditional
result and can perhaps be appreciated more nowadays than in the heroic precomputer times.
The first symptom is the great proliferation of small terms of higher
order. If the lunar coordinates are required to a relative precision of
10- 8 ' it is not sufficient to know all the coefficients ;::: 10- 8 in the
Fourier expansion (3.4). The author (Gutzwiller 1979) has calculated
8 , 10- 9 ) ;
the root-mean-square of the coefficients in the interval
i.e., the squares of the coefficients in this interval were added up and
the root of the sum was taken; it is almost 10- 7 . Thus, the small terms
generate a background noise which has to be controlled by pushing the
expansion far beyond its original goal.
The second symptom is the very small denominator that was mentioned at the beginning of Section 5.4. The original intention of
Schmidt and the author was to guarantee a relative precision of 10- 10
by obtaining all coefficients down to 10- 12 and calculating each to an
accuracy of 10- 14 , i.e., reals defined by 64 bits. The boost of 2000 by
the small denominator, however, forced us to push down to 10- 17 , and
reals defined by 128 bits, an accuracy far beyond any measurement,
since it corresponds to 4.10- 7 em, or 40 atomic radii, at the distance
of the Moon.

CHAPTER 6

Periodic Orbits

The idea of everything returning eventually to its point of departure
has a strong hold on humanity, with many historical, philosophical, and
religious implications. Kepler's discovery of the elliptical orbits for the
planets in the solar system seemed to give a scientific basis to this
predilection for things running along a closed track and repeating their
history over and over again. The motion of the Moon does not fit this
picture in its most narrow interpretation; but we have seen in the past
chapters how the invariant tori of an integrable system generalize the
simple-minded view. Instead of one period after which all momenta
and positions return to their initial values, one deals with as many different periods as degrees of freedom.
The various periods in the lunar problem are vastly different: a
month for the main motion around the Earth, a year for the direct periodic influence of the Sun, as well as 9 and 18 yt!ars for the Sun's
secular effect. It hardly matters whether the exact ratios of these periods are rational numbers or not, except when one has to set up a calendar.
All the great civilizations have established simple rational approximations for the ratios of these periods. The most useful of them is the
Metonic cycle of 19 tropical years, which contains 235 synodic months,
with a difference of only 1I 4 of a day; on its basis the Jewish calendar
has a well-defined sequence of 12 short years containing 12 months
and 7 long years containing 13 months. Solar and lunar eclipses can
be conveniently organized into Saros cycles of 223 synodic months ~
239 anomalistic months ~ 241 sidereal months ~~ 242 draconitic

76

Periodic Orbits

months ~ 18 years 11 + 1/3 days. The 1/3 day is remarkable, because
it means that almost exactly the same type of eclipse is seen in the same
place on Earth every 54 years and 34 days, i.e., with a delay of only
one month.
The search for exactly periodic orbits may have been inspired by
these amazing near coincidences; but their importance for modern
physics has a quite different origin and was first recognized by
Poincare (1892, Chapter III). He found that periodic orbits, i.e., solutions of the equations of motion that return to their initial conditions,
are densely distributed among all possible classical trajectories; and he
suggested that the study of periodic orbits would provide the clue to the
overall behavior of any mechanical system. In his words,

"what makes these periodic solutions so valuable, is that they offer,
in a manner of speaking, the only opening through which we might
try to penetrate into the fortress which has the reputation of being
impregnable. "
Periodic orbits form continuous families in phase space that can be
investigated by varying either the energy of the system or some external parameter like the relative masses of the bodies involved. There
are fascinating details, in particular the sudden bifurcation of a particular isolated periodic orbit, or its unexpected birth without further
warning. The reader will find interesting examples in the work of
Henon ( 1966-70) on the Restricted Three-Body Problem, i.e., a light
body moving in the same plane as two heavy bodies that are in a circular orbit around their center of mass; Hill's theory of the lunar
perigee (cf. Section 5.5) is a special case. Contopoulos (1970) investigated the motion in the galactic gravitational field; Baranger and
Davies (1987) with de Aguiar and Malta (1987) finally carried the
good word to the quantum-chaos-minded physicists. A lot of work has
been done about actually finding periodic orbits; cf. Helleman (1978),
as well as Kook and Meiss (1989).
Poincare's suggestion seemed, at first, to be valuable only as a general approach for the better understanding of some difficult problems
in classical mechanics. Since the advent of quantum mechanics, however, the periodic orbits have turned out to be of special significance
in the transition from the classical to the quantum regime; this idea is
the essence of the trace formula which will be explained in Chapter 17.
The present chapter will discuss how periodic orbits arise in an
integrable system, how many of them there are, and how phase space
looks in their neighborhood whether the system is integrable or not.

Periodic Orbits

6.1 Potentials with Circular Symmetry
Periodic orbits in an integrable system are best handled with the help
of the action-angle formalism. The main ideas come out clearly when
studying a particle moving in a plane under the influence of a potential
V(r) that depends only on the distance r from the origin. Einstein
(1917) gave this example in his paper on quantization conditions,
which has inspired many researchers ever since it was 11 discovered 11 by
Keller (1958). Although the circular symmetry of the problem makes
the discussion almost trivial, the reader should pay close attention to
some of the finer points such as the exact definition of the angle variables, and the calculation of the Hamiltonian in terms of the actions.
In polar coordinates (r, cp), the Hamiltonian becomes
p2
M2
H(p, M, r, cp) = - 2 + -+ V(r) = E,
(6.1)
2

where we have used the conjugate pairs (p, r) and (Af, cp) with the radial momentum p and the angular momentum M. The radial momentum p is not a good action variable for this problem because its
conjugate variable r still occurs explicitly in H; but since we have succeeded in separating the variables, we can find the relevant actions with
the help of (3.2). M is the action for the azimuthal motion, while the
action N for the radial motion is given by the integral

where the limits of integration, r1 and r2 , are the roots of the equation

E = V(r) + M2/2mr 2 .

The invariant tori in the three-dimensional surface of constant energy E can now be represented, exactly as Einstein saw them for the
first time, by using a cylindrical coordinate system with the polar coordinates (r, cp) in the horizontal plane and p along the vertical. The
trajectories of the Hamiltonian ( 6.1) for a given value of M form a
closed curve in the vertical (r, p) plane, which has to be rotated around
the p -axis to generate a torus. These tori for different values of M
are nested inside one another as shown in Figure 9.
The angular momentum M reaches its largest value M 0 at the core
of these nested tori, when the two solutions, r 1 and r 2 , coincide, and
their common value is r 0 ; the corresponding value of N = 0. As M
decreases, N increases, and reaches a maximum N 0 when M = 0. The
values of M can be both positive and negative; but N is always positive,
and depends only on I MI. For each value of E, there is a well-defined
curve of N versus M.

(6.3)

the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator of frequency w has the
Hamiltonian H 0 = (N + IM i)w. In both cases the matrix of second
derivatives with respect to N and M is singular; the further investigations do not apply to these special cases. A similar fate awaits the
case of two independent harmonic oscillators; it is not a good example
for studying the effect of perturbations on typical integrable systems.
The frequency w 1 which is associated with N according to (3.3), is
obtained by taking the derivative of ( 6.2) with respect toN at constant
M, while considering E to be a function of both Nand M. The resulting
expression is more easily written in terms of the period

this formula gives the elementary expression for the time to cover the
radial motion from r 1 and r2 and back, since the equations of motion
give dt = m drIp and p is obtained from ( 6.1). A similar argument

6.1 Potentials with Circular Symmetry

79

gives the frequency w2 for the azimuthal motion as the ratio of two integrals like (6.4). Once the frequencies are known, the corresponding
angle variables follow simply by multiplying with t which is the integral
over m drip.
The angle variables, w 1 and w2, are not very interesting because they
are both proportional to the time. The angle cf>, however, does not increase linearly with time since the equations of motion give
dct> = dt Mlmr 2 . The average rate of increase with time for cf> is the
same as for w 2, namely w2; but the difference cf> -- w2 is a periodic
function of time, exactly as the difference between the true anomaly
f' = cf> 1 - g' and the mean anomaly e' in the Kepler motion of (4.3).
The same thing happens in the three-body problem: the intuitive choice
of the various angles differs from the final angle variables by terms that
are periodic in time. These are called the inequalities in the traditional
astronomical literature because they give the real motion of the celestial bodies through the sky an irregular appearance.
Periodic orbits arise when the ratio of the two frequencies, wd w2 ,
is a rational number vI f.l where v and f.l are assumed to be relatively
prime. One can then write w 1 = vw 0 and w 2 = f.lWo in terms of the
overall period To = 2'17 I wo. In the case of orbital precession, the polar
angle cf> has increased beyond 2'17 by a rational fraction of 2'17, in the
time it takes the radial motion to complete its period; Figure 10 shows
a case of orbital regression.
Let us now go back to the surface of constant energy, as shown in
Figure 11 d, and look at two consecutive intersections of a trajectory
with the vertical plane cf> = 0. The intersection of an invariant torus
with cf> = 0 forms a simply closed loop. An initial point on the r-axis,
with r > ro, does not complete the closed loop as it returns to cf> = 0;
it may advance by some angle less than 2'17, in a rough manner of
speaking. The greater the loop in Figure lld, the less the advance of
the representative point.
The periodic orbits occur on those tori, where upon f.l consecutive
intersections with cf> = 0, the representative point completes exactly v
turns around its loop. For a fixed value of the energy E, each loop is
characterized by its value for M, or equivalently by N, or again by the
ratio of the two frequencies, all of which vary continuously in some
interval. The rational values of this ratio form a dense set in this interval, just as Poincare pointed out.

radial motion goes through one cycle, from its minimum r1 to its maximum r2
and back.

6.2 The Number of Periodic Orbits in an Integrable System
The arguments of the last section are now generalized to an integrable
system with n degrees of freedom. We assume that the transformation
to action-angle variables has been carried out, and the new
Hamiltonian is a function of the actions h, h, ... , In. The frequencies
are then given by the formulas (3.3), w1 = fJHifJI1 in terms of the
actions. But it is now crucial that these formulas can be inverted: one
needs the map w -+ I rather than the map I -+ w, which the
Hamiltonian yields. This inversion is possible only if the matrix of the
second derivatives fJwJ fJJ_j = 8 2HI d/ifJJ_j is regular. This last condition fails for the Kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator, as shown
in (6.3).
Let us now proceed to the frequency space (w 1, w2 , ... , wn), and
consider in it a straight line through the origin in the direction
This line cuts through the energy surface
(K 1, K2, ... , Kn).
H(IJ, ... , In) = E in the point (woJ, ... , won). In particular, if we have
chosen integer values for the K's, i.e., KJ = k1 , we find that
w01 = k1 w0 ; all the frequencies are integer multiples of some basic
The corresponding trajectory has the period
frequency w0 .
To = 271' I w 0 . Inside the allowed region of frequency space, the ratios
of the integers k can be given arbitrarily; the more complicated they

81

are, the smaller is the common frequency w 0 and the longer is the
overall period To.
The use of classical periodic orbits in quantum mechanics requires
the calculation of the action integral S over one period,
S =

= (Jlwl + · · · + lnwn) Wo = 2'1T (kl/1 + · · · + knln) ·

The last expression is easily misunderstood, because the integers k do
not only appear as the explicit factors of the actions /, but the actions
depend implicitly on the chosen values of the integers. Let us, therefore, find out how the value of S changes when the integers k are
changed by some small amounts ok.
In order to carry out this computation, we go back to the original
real numbers (K 1, ••• , Kn). which are to be changed by (oKJ. ... , OKn).
The energy E = H(I 1, ••• , In) has to remain the same, and this leads to
the condition

but the second term on the right vanishes because of oH = 0.
The remaining first term can be interpreted in the light of Bohr's
correspondence principle. The K's are replaced by the large integers
k, as in a highly excited state, and the real increments OK become the
small integer increments ok, as in the transition to a neighboring state.
The above calculation is still valid since the ok's are small compared
with the k's. Thus, one finds that
oS = 2'1T ( / 1ok1 + .. . + Inokn) .
(6.6)
The action is a first-order homogeneous function of the K's, and also
of the k's as long as they are large.
For the purpose of counting how many periodic orbits there are
whose actionS is smaller than some positive number a, we can treatS
as if it were a linear function of the positive integers ki with positive
coefficients /i . Therefore, the number of periodic orbits for a fixed energy E, and for which S < a, grows as the n-th power of a.

82

Periodic Orbits

This polynomial growth in the number of periodic orbits for an
integrable system is in sharp contrast to the exponential growth in a
mechanical system with hard chaos, a condition that will be discussed
at length in the later chapters. The polynomial growth can be directly
traced to the one-to-one relation between n -tuples of integers
(k 1 , ... , kn) and periodic orbits. Such a simple characterization does not
work any longer in a chaotic system.

6.3 The Neighborhood of a Periodic Orbit
Hill's theory of the motions of the Moon (cf. Sections 5.5 and 5.6) was
based on the idea of investigating the neighborhood of a particular
simple periodic orbit of the full Hamiltonian. The neighboring trajectories were calculated as Fourier series in the basic angle variable T of
the periodic orbit; the computations can be carried to high accuracy.
The study of chaotic systems requires a less detailed, but more general
understanding of periodic orbits, which can eventually be related directly to the variational principle and Feynman's path integral. The
present section is intended to lay the foundation for this complementary approach.
Without restriction as to the integrability or lack thereof in the mechanical system, let us latch onto one particular periodic orbit, which
starts with the momentum ji it!_the position q and returns to this place
in phase space after the time T. We shall assume that all the trajectories that start at (p', q') in some sufficiently small neighborhood of
(ji, q) will return to that neighborhood after some time t close to T.
None of these trajectories ever strays far from the periodic orbit during
the timet.
We will examine the neighboring trajectories in function of their
initial conditions (p', q') and their endpoints (p", q"), all in the neighborhood of (ji, q). Although (p', q') and (p", q") are in the same
neighborhood of (p, q), they are joined by a long trajectory; when either (p', q') or (p", q'') are allowed to vary, the whole trajectory connecting them will change in order to join correctly the initial and the
final points while running close to the periodic orbit.
The whole calculation will be carried out for a system with three
degrees of freedom, because that represents already the most general
case, whereas such is not true for two degrees of freedom. We will also
avail ourselves of a special set of coordinates in phase space whose
existence and benefits will be established in the next chapter. The
momentum coordinate p 1 is simply the energy E, quite generally; the

6.3 The Neighborhood of a Periodic Orbit

83

position coordinate q1 is the time variable along the periodic orbit for
the points on it. For the points off the periodic orbit, however, the
coordinate q1 is a continuously differentiable function of the original
coordinates. The points with q 1 = constant and p 1 = E form a fourdimensional submanifold transverse to the periodic orbit. The remaining coordinates (p2 , p 3 , q 2 , q3 ) vary in such a submanifold, but are
otherwise chosen arbitrarily with the only restriction that
(pt. qt) , (pz, qz) , (p3, q3) are canonically conjugate, or equivalently
that the action integral S is given by f (p1dqi + pzdq2 + p3dq3) from q'
to q" .
The action integral S(q11 q' E) is taken along the trajectory that
starts at q' in the neighborhood of q, runs close to the periodic orbit for
one, two, or more turns, whichever is of interest, and ends up at q11
again in the neighborhood of q, while moving at the energy E. We
could have left out the explicit mention of E since in our special coordinate system p" I = p' I = E, but the energy E is listed explicitly to
make the connection with the formulas in Chapter 3. In particular we
need (2.4) in order to calculate the momentap' andp''.
This formula is now used to get the displacements 8p = p - p and
8q = q - q, while PI and qi are kept fixed,

where the index i takes only the values 2 and 3, while the second derivatives are evaluated at q" = q' = (j. These formulas can be written
in the abbreviated form
8p' = -a 8q' - b 8q11 ,
8p11 = b+ 8q' + c 8q11 , (6.8)
where a, b, and c stand for the 2 by 2 matrices of second derivatives
of S with respect to q' and q 11 , and b+ is the transpose of b.
In order to understand the geometry of the trajectories in the
neighborhood of the periodic orbit, one would like to have formulas for
8p" and 8q" in terms of 8p' and 8q', such as
8q" = A 8q'

+ B8p',

8p" = C 8q'

+ D8p',

(6.9)

where A= - b- 1a, B = - b- 1, C = b+- cb- 1a, D = - cb-I. These
2 by 2 matrices are well defined provided the matrix b of mixed second
derivatives of S with respect to q' and q" is regular. A similar matrix
was discussed in Chapter 2 when trying to find the formula (2. 7) for
the density of trajectories; but the relevant expression contained the
second derivatives with respect to all position coordinates and the en-

84

ergy, rather than only the position coordinates of index larger than 1.
The relation between these two matrices and their determinants will
become clear when the trace formula is discussed in Chapter 17.

6.4 Elliptic, Parabolic, and Hyperbolic Periodic Orbits
The behavior of the trajectories near the periodic orbit is described by
the linear transformation (fJp', fJq') - (13p", fJq") of (6.9). Naturally,
one looks for the eigenvalues "A of this linear transformation, and calculates, therefore, the characteristic polynomial F("A), which is given
by the determinant

F("A) =

'(6.10)

where I is the 2 by 2 unit matrix. The second determinant was obtained
from the first by replacing A, B, etc. by their expression in terms a, b,
and cas given in (6.9). Moreover, the first two lines in the first determinant have been multiplied with c, and then subtracted from the last
two lines.
This kind of manipulation is continued by first multiplying the first
lines in the second determinant of (6.10) by b, and compensating this
change by dividing the whole determinant with det I b I, which yields
the expression
1

I - a - "Ab - - "AII I= lbl

where the second determinant results from the first one if the first two
lines are multiplied by "A, and subtracted from the last two lines. At this
point, the 4 by 4 determinant has been effectively reduced to a 2 by 2
determinant, and one can write
F("A) = det lb+ +(a+ c)?\+ b"A 2 1/ det lbl,
(6.11)
which ts the desired result of this calculation.
The first corollary of (6.11) states that F(O) = 1, i.e., the determinant of the linear transformation ( 6. 9) is 1; the transformation conserves the four-dimensional volume of the submanifold
(q 1 = q, p 1 = p} in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit. This proposition will be generalized in the next chapter. The present purpose
is to find out more about the eigenvalues of the transformation (6.9),
i.e., the solutions of the equation F("A) = 0.
Since the matrix elements in a, b, and c are real, the solutions of this
algebraic equation either are real, or come in complex conjugate pairs.

6.4 Elliptic, Parabolic, and Hyperbolic POs

Moreover, the expression (6.11) shows that, if A is any zero ofF, then
so is 1/A. Thus, we have the following four possibilities which carry
the classical designations:
(i) elliptic for A = exp(ix), exp( -ix) with x real;
(ii) direct parabolic for A = + 1 or inverse parabolic for A = - 1;
(iii) direct hyperbolic for A = exp( ± x), or inverse hyperbolic for
A = - exp( ± x) with real x;
(iv) loxodromic for A = exp( ± u ± iv) with independent signs and
real values of u and v.
The first three cases occur in a system with two degrees of freedom,
but the fourth case requires at least three degrees of freedom.
The values of F( 1) for the three first cases will come up in the trace
formula (cf. Chapter 17); they are given by the expressions:
-4 ( sinh(x/2)) 2 for direct hyperbolic, 0 for direct parabolic,
4 ( sin(x/2)) 2 for elliptic, +4 for inverse parabolic, and
4 ( cosh(x/2) ) 2 for inverse hyperbolic orbits. Notice that these values
of F(l) span the full range from - oo to +oo; Greene (1979) gave the
name residue to this quantity F( 1) which characterizes the neighborhood behavior of the periodic orbit.
Since the first three cases describe transformations of a twodimensional manifold in the neighborhood of the p(~riodic orbit, they
can be represented schematically as shown in Figure 11. In order to
get from the initial point P' to the final point P" in the transformation
(6.9), the point P has to slide by a certain amount along either ellipses,
parallel lines, or hyperbolas, as indicated by the arrows.
The situation in an integrable system (see Figure 11d) can only be
reconciled with the parabolic case. When a mechanical system is
integrable, the transformation (6.9) in the neighborhood of a periodic
orbit has only the eigenvalues ± 1. Since periodic orbits are dense, this
special feature has to be true everywhere. For systems with two degrees of freedom in particular, the 2 by 2 matrices in (6.9) reduce to
real numbers; the condition for parabolic behavior of the periodic orbit
becomes a + c = ± 2b.
Integrable systems are, therefore, non-generic; they are exceptional, unless some principle in nature exists which gives preference to
them over all the others; but none has been found so far. If a mechanical system with two degrees of freedom is generic, the neighborhood of a periodic orbit has to be elliptic or hyperbolic. It becomes
then very difficult to reconcile a collection of the local behavior as depicted in Figure 11 with some simple overall pattern such as in Figure
11d. This is the reason why chaotic systems are unavoidable in mechanics; in most cases there is an intimate mixture of elliptic and

hyperbolic behavior which we shall call soft chaos; Markus and Meyer
( 197 4) provide a mathematical version of this statement. Phase space
might look integrable at some rough scale, although the fine details are
much more complicated.
If the behavior is hyperbolic throughout, however, a relatively simple overall pattern can usually be established in spite of the prevailing
chaos. In fact, the chaotic features in such a system turn out to be
particularly striking, a condition we shall therefore call hard chaos. In
our view, classical mechanical systems cover a wide range of chaotic
behavior, with integrability as a rather exceptional situation on one
end, and hard chaos as a structurally stable, i.e., immune to small perturbations, but not the most general situation at the other end.

CHAPTER 7

The Surface of Section

The trajectories in phase space often have very involved global features
which are in apparent contradiction to the locally smooth flow.
Poincare proposed to deal with this problem by inte:rcepting the flow
at discrete times, rather than by following up on every little shift and
displacement. His method, known as the surface of section, has become the main tool for studying chaotic systems, and will be discussed
in this chapter for the special case of Hamiltonian systems. The main
ideas are all of geometrical origin and will be present,ed in this light.

7.1 The Invariant Two-Form
The adjectives 'dynamical' and 'Hamiltonian' have been used quite
loosely in the preceding chapters; it is now important, however, to follow the common usage. A dynamical system is a smooth vector field in
phase space, and its trajectories are obtained by joining its little local
arrows into continuous curves. A Hamiltonian system is the special case
of a dynamical system where the vector field is defined by the formulas
(2.2) in terms of the Hamiltonian H(p, q).
This book deals exclusively with Hamiltonian syst~~ms; they turn out
to be a very particular subset somewhere at the outer boundary of the
large set of dynamical systems. Nature has decided to be Hamiltonian
at its most basic level; non-Hamiltonian dynamical systems come up in
physics only as phenomenological models for the more complicated
underlying processes. The characteristic differences between the two

88

The Surface of Section

types of systems shows up most clearly when discussing the surfaces
of section.
The first step in our approach is the construction of the canonical
two-form Q. For this purpose, we choose an arbitrary point (p, q) in
phase space and two more points in its neighborhood. The latter are
defined by giving their displacement from (p, q), i.e., a vector
(8p1, ... , 8pn, 8q1, ... , 8qn)
for
the
first,
and
a
vector
(!::.p1, ... , !::.pn, !::.q1, ... , !::.qn) for the second displacement. These two
vectors span a parallelogram whose area is defined as
n

Q(8, t::.>

= L (8pi t::.qi -

8qi t::.p;).

(7.1)

i =I

The canonical two-form Q is antisymmetric, in its two arguments, which
means that Q(8, !::.) = - Q(!::., 8).
The three points in phase space (p, q), (p + 8p, q + 8q), and
(p + !::.p, q + !::.q) are now taken as the starting points for three different trajectories, each a solution of (2.2) with a well-defined
Hamiltonian H(p, q), which will remain the same throughout this
chapter. Therefore, p, q, 8p, 8q, !::.p, and !::.q become functions of the
time t. Since the displacements from (p, q) are assumed to be small,
however, the equations of motion (2.2) can be simplified by expanding
around the central trajectory p(t), q(t). Therefore,

where one inserts the functions p(t) and q(t) into the second derivatives
of H. The vector (!::.p, !::.q) satisfies the same set of linear, first-order,
ordinary differential equations. Equations (5.16) for the displacements from Hill's periodic orbit in the lunar problem are a special case
of (7.2).
It is now a trivial exercise to check that
d Q(8, !::.)
(7.3)

whatever the initial values of p, q, 8p, 8q, !::.p, and !::.q. In words, the
value of the area Q for the little parallelogram remains the same as the
three neighboring trajectories proceed, each along its own course.
A more striking formulation of this result starts from an arbitrary,
simply connected, two-dimensional surface W bounded by a curve C.
Such a surface is parametrized by two real variables (u, v) with the help
of functions p(u, v) and q(u, v) where (u, v) is limited to a simple do-

7.1 The Invariant Two-Form

main. This domain is divided into small rectangles (ou, ~v) by the increments ou and ~ v, each of which gives rise to a pair of displacements
(op, oq) and (~p, ~q). If the corresponding areas Q(8, ~)are summed
over the domain in (u, v), the surface Win phase space gets a value A
for its total area.
Each combination (u, v) defines the starting point for a trajectory;
there is now a two-parameter family of trajectories in terms of the
functionsp(u, v, t) and q(u, v, t). The whole surface Wis thereby made
to move as timet changes; we can speak of a surface W(t) with an area
A(t). By virtue of the equation (7 .3), the area A is constant, i.e., does
not vary with time. This fact is expressed sometimes by saying that A
is an integral invariant of the Hamiltonian system.
Notice that the constancy of A does not depend at all on the particular Hamiltonian that describes the system; on the contrary, the invariance of the integral A depends only on the peculiar structure of the
equations of motion (2.2). The integral invariant n says something
rather profound of a purely geometric nature concerning mechanical
systems in general. Anticipating again some results to be discussed
much later, the integral A is limited by quantum mechanics to simple
multiples of Planck's quantum. This may be another instance where
quantum mechanics lurks in the background, although neither
Poincare nor we could suspect such a relation at this point of the discussion.

7.2 Integral Invariants and Liouville's Theorem
The constancy of n is the generalization of a theorem of Liouville
which has been known since the middle of the last century, and which
plays a central role in statistical mechanics. The derivation of this
theorem from (7.3) leads to further theorems that are needed for the
work in the next section.
Let us consider a total of four neighboring points for (p, q), or
equivalently, four vectors, the previous (op, oq) and (~p, ~q), and the
new (dp, dq) and (Dp, Dq), which give the displacements from (p, q).
Together they span a four-dimensional parallelepiped to which can be
assigned the volume S1 4 (8, ~. d, D), which is defined as
Q(8, ~) Q(d, D) -

Q(8, d) Q(~, D) + Q(8, D) Q(~, d). (7.4)

This combination is the only one that is antisymmet:ric under any exchange of two arguments, as for example :12 4 (8, ~. d, D) =
- rl 4 (d, ~. 8, D), apart from an arbitrary constant factor.

90

The Surface of Section

This four-dimensional volume Q4 is also called a four-form; and
since it is entirely based on the two-form Q, it is often written as
Q/\Q. The symbol !\ indicates the formation of an antisymmetric
product like (7.4), also called the exterior product of Q with itself.
The base point (p, q) and its four neighbors can again be taken as
the initial conditions for one central and four neighboring trajectories,
by solving (2.2) and (7.2). The four vectors 8, Ll, d, Dare then functions of the time t, and so is the volume Q4 . Equation (7 .3) now shows
that the value of Q4 does not depend on time, because in taking the time
derivative of (7 .4) each factor in the three terms is constant.
The exterior product of Q with itself can be formed as many times
as there are degrees of freedom. The antisymmetrizing operation like
(7 .4) yields zero when the vectors are not linearly independent, and
only 2n vectors at most can be independent in a 2n-dimensional space.
The 2n - form f22n is the ordinary (Cartesian) 2n-dimensional volume
of phase space.
As in the preceding section, one can now consider a simply connected piece W of 4, ... , or 2n dimensions in phase space. This piece
Whas a well-defined volume in terms of the exterior products of Q with
itself. Also, W can serve as the base for an ensemble of trajectories
that move simultaneously through phase space. At each moment, this
moving piece W(t) has a volume that is always computed with the help
of Q and its exterior products. Therefore, the volume of W is constant
in time.
This last statement for a 2n-dimensional piece of phase space is
Liouville's theorem. The importance of this theorem lies in its implications for the long-time behavior of the generic trajectory in a typical
Hamiltonian system. The word generic is meant to exclude trajectories
with special properties such as the periodic orbits, and the word typical
is designed to remove special Hamiltonians from our discussion, such
as the integrable ones. Non-generic trajectories have initial conditions
whose measure in terms of Q is zero; in a more vague sense, atypical
Hamiltonians have near them an overwhelming number of typical ones.
In most Hamiltonian systems an arbitrarily chosen piece W of phase
space with an initially simple shape gets progressively deformed into a
grotesque tangle of interwoven arms and branches, while staying simply connected and keeping the same volume (cf. Figure 24). Eventually every piece of phase space will contain some part of this tangle
W(t), and the available volume will be distributed equally; i.e., the
volume of W(t) contained in some particular piece is proportional to
the volume of that piece; it constitutes the same fraction everywhere.
The Hamiltonian system is then called ergodic, which is the normal situation, although it is not true in integrable systems.

7.2 Integral Invariants and Liouville's Theorem

91

The word 'ergodic' needs an explanation: of its two Greek components, 'erg' refers to energy, and 'odos' to the trajectory. In a conservative Hamiltonian system, the energy stays constant so that each
trajectory stays on a (2n - 1)-dimensional submanifold H(p, q) = E.
The description of the increasing tangle in the preceding paragraph has
to be restricted to such a surface of constant energy. The invariant
volume on a constant energy surface, however, is the result of the more
general invariant volume for the whole phase space.
When one starts with some simply connected piece of the constant
energy surface H(p, q) = E, it is necessary to enlarge its content by
including the whole slab of phase space between the energies E and
E + e where e can be an arbitrarily small increment. Liouville's theorem can only be applied to the slab. The thickness of the slab in terms
of the coordinates (p, q) can vary from place to place. If one has defined some measure of (2n- I)-dimensional volume on the constant
energy surface (e.g., by using the 2n components of p and q like
Cartesian coordinates), then it is essential to divide this measure by the
absolute value of the gradient of H with respect top and q. Otherwise,
Liouville's theorem does not hold on the surface of constant energy.

7.3 Area Conservation on the Surface of Section
The flow of trajectories on a surface of constant energy H(p, q) = E
will now be studied in more detail. It would be difficult to follow all
the many curves as they wind around this (2n- I)-dimensional subInstead, we will concentrate on a
manifold of phase space.
(2n - 2)-dimensional submanifold of the constant energy surface,
called a surface of section~. which is transverse to the flow; i.e.,~ cuts
the flow, or put differently,~ is never tangent to the flow. Apart from
this requirement, the only other condition to be satisfied is that every
trajectory actually does intersect ~.
The points on this surface of section ~ can serve as initial conditions
for the trajectories at the given energy E. Let us pick one such point
(p(O>, q( 0 )) and start a trajectory there at the time t = 0. Unless we
have chosen a bad surface of section, or a poor point on it, this trajectory will intersect~ again at some later time t 1 in the point (pO>, qO>),
but not at any time between 0 and t 1• In this manner, the point
(p(O>, q(O>) is mapped into (pO>, qO>); ~ is mapped into itself. This
transformation of ~ into itself gives a somewhat simplified picture of
the flow of trajectories on the surface of constant energy.
The integral invariants for the flow of trajectories in phase space
are now carried over into this transformation. Continuous time as the

92

The Surface of Section

governing parameter is translated into some kind of discrete stepping
mechanism. The basic geometric features of mechanics up to now were
always tied to the coordinates (p, q) being continuous functions of the
time t ; but when we use the surface of section, we look at each trajectory only as it crosses~. i.e., at the times t = 0, t 1, and at any of the
subsequent times, t 2 , t 3 , and so on. To make things even more strange,
the exact values for t 1, t 2 , etc. depend on the initial point (p(O), q< 0 >).
It is very often neither desirable nor even possible to find ~ such that
the times of intersection t 1 , t2 , etc. are the same for all the points on
~.

As in the previous two sections, let us look at neighboring points to
(p<O>, q< 0 >), but this time located in ~. The vectors (8p, 8q) and
(!J.p, !J.q) are, therefore, tangent to ~. Since the neighboring points
belong to the same constant energy surface and satisfy H(p, q) = E,
we have

+ - - 8qk = 0 '

(7.5)

with a similar equation for (!J.p, !J.q); the derivatives of Hare taken in
(p< 0>, q< 0 >). This relation can be interpreted differently if we introduce
the vector T = (jJ, q), i.e., the tangent to the trajectory at (p(O), q< 0 >).
With the help of the equations of motion (2.2) and the definition (7 .1)
of the two-form 0, one can write (7.5) as 0(8, T) = 0, and 0(/J., T) =
0. Of course, one has trivially O(T, T) = 0.
The two-form 0(8, !J.) is now transported along the trajectory that
starts in (p<0 >, q<O>), until the time t1 when this trajectory intersects ~
again. The value of 0(8, !J.) does not change; but the new vectors
(8p<I), 8q<I)) and (!J.pCI), !J.qCO) are not necessarily tangent to ~ any
longer, because the two neighboring points move along trajectories that
differ from the one through (p<0 >, q< 0>), and hit~ at a time that differs
slightly from t 1• This complication can be removed, however, as will
be shown in the next paragraph.
To the first order in the displacements, a change in the time t 1 adds
to (8p<O, 8q<O) a multiple of the vector T], which is the tangent at time
t = t 1 to the original trajectory through (p< 0>, q< 0 >). If we continue the
neighboring trajectory until it intersects~. we get a vector 8 1, which is
tangent to ~ in (pO>, q<O), but which differs from (8p<O, 8q<O) by a
multiple of T1. Since 0(8, T) = O(!J., T) = 0 for all times, such corrections do not change the value of 0(8, !J.) at t 1•
If one now looks at the map of~ into itself, the vectors 8 or !J. that
join two neighboring points get mapped into the vectors 81 or !J.1 joining the corresponding transformed points. The above arguments show
that
(7.6)

7.3 Area Conservation on the Surface of Section

93

The discontinuous transformation of ~ into itself has, therefore, the
same geometrical properties as the continuous map of the whole phase
space as time increases. In particular, Liouville's theorem, the conservation of volume in~. follows by the same reasoning as in the preceding section.

7.4 The Theorem of Darboux
The surface of section is especially useful in systems with two degrees
of freedom, because ~ then has two dimensions, and the map of ~ into
itself can be visualized rather easily. Also the choice of~ is often quite
straightforward; e.g., if we start with the pairs of canonically conjugate
coordinates (p1, q1) and (p2, q2 ), we define ~ as the submanifold
q1 = 0 in the energy surface H(p, q) =E. The second pair (p2, q2) is
then the natural coordinate system in ~, and the invariant element of
area is simply dp2dq2.
While almost all the examples in this book have no more than two
degrees of freedom, and the above remarks are sufficient for their discussion, one would like eventually to advance into the vast arena of
Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom. The surface of
section ~ then has four dimensions, however, and only very few pioneers (e.g., Froeschle 1970) have had the courage to penetrate into this
jungle. For example, the restricted three-body problem where the two
primary bodies, such as the Sun and the Earth for the Moon, or the Sun
and Jupiter for the asteroids, move in a fixed circle, has three degrees
of freedom, and requires a four-dimensional surface of section. The
neighborhood of a periodic orbit was already studied in Section 6.3
with the help of this more general setting.
Among the questions which arise is the following: Is it always possible to make ~ part of a canonical coordinate system such that the last
two pairs (p2, q2) and (p3 , q3) are the coordinates for ~. while p 1 = E
represents the energy, and q1 = tis the time, at least in the neighborhood of ~ ? The general answer to this question is affirmative, and the
construction of the required canonical coordinates is based on a theorem by Darboux. The whole discussion will be carried out for a system
with three degrees of freedom because all the essential elements of the
argument are present there already.
The original system is described by the usual canonical coordinates
(p1, P2· PJ, q1, q2, q3) in phase space with the Hamiltonian H(p, q). The
surface of section~ is defined in terms of four variables z 1 , ••. , z4 ; the
coordinates (p, q) are known functions of the z's. The map of~ into
itself leaves the two-form Q invariant, if one restricts the displacements

94

The Surface of Section

8 and Ll to be tangent to~. Varying any one of the z's generates such
a displacement 8 = (8p, 8q). The two-form S1 that is originally defined

for any displacements in phase space, becomes thereby a two-form n~
which is restricted to the displacements in~.
In terms of the variables z, the two-form n~ does not look as simple
and concise as the definition of n in terms of p and q in (7.1). But the
transition from n to n~ is easy to work out; the displacements
8p, 8q, Llp, and Llq in (7.1) have to be written in terms of oz and Llz.
The result can be expressed with the help of the Lagrange bracket with
respect to the two variables z and t,

The coefficients in this two-form, cl>ke = [zk. ze}, are functions of the

The question of finding the canonical coordinates in ~ now becomes: Are there functions fz, / 3 , g2 , g3 of z1, ... , z4 such that

The answer comes in the theorem of Darboux: Given any two-form
(7.8) in~. the necessary and sufficient conditions for finding new coordinates fz , ... , g3 such that (7 .9) holds, are the equations

where the summation over the indices j, k, and from 1 to 4 is implied
as usual by the Einstein convention concerning indices that occur twice

four indices are all different; e = 1 when (i j k f) is an even permutation of (1234), e = -1 when (i j k f) is an odd permutation of (1234).
It is a straightforward exercise in differentiation to show that the
Lagrange brackets [zk, ze} satisfy (7.10).
The necessity of (7 .10) for the required existence of the new
canonical coordinate pairs (/2, g2 ) and (/3, g 3 ) is easy to prove because
(7.10) is satisfied in the new coordinates as follows from the right-hand
side of (7.9), and a straightforward calculation shows that (7.10) must

7.4 The Theorem of Darboux

95

hold in all coordinate systems if it holds in one of them. The difficulty
with Darboux's theorem lies in demonstrating the sufficiency of (7.10).
We shall not attempt even to give a glimpse of how this part of the
proof can be carried out; but before sending the reader to the relevant
sources, a few cautionary remarks seem appropriate.
The two modern references, Abraham and Marsden (1978) and
Arnold (197 8), rely completely on their discussion of symplectic geometry, which takes up dozens of pages before coming to Darboux's theorem. To work through this whole build-up of preliminary material is
made difficult at best by the use of modern, mathematical terminology;
at the end, it is almost impossible for the physicist to tell where exactly
the new coordinate system was actually shown to exist, rather than just
being defined and manipulated. The original paper by Darboux (1882)
is quite readable, and gets right away into the main business of showing
which ordinary differential equations have to be solved in order to find
the new coordinates. It is written for a mathematical audience of the
time, however, not for physicists, and ends up being very long because
many different cases of similar nature are treated without regard to
their relevance in mechanics.
Since mechanics is a branch of physics, the conditions (7 .1 0) cannot
be left standing without mentioning another area where they play a
central role, Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. The four variables z now describe our everyday space-time continuum, and the
antisymmetric functions ~kf are the components of the magnetic and
the electric fields in the notation of special relativity, B 1 = ~ 23 ,
B2 = ~31 , B3 = ~12, F1 = ~14, F2 = ~24, F3 = ~34. The conditions
(7.10) are the one half of Maxwell's equations which does not involve
the electric charges and currents. They proclaim the absence of magnetic monopoles, and Faraday's laws of magnetic induction; they
guarantee the existence of a four-component vector potential A from
which the magnetic and the electric fields are obtained by calculating
the curl in four dimensions. Although the theorem of Darboux is based
on the same conditions, its conclusion in the form of the canonical coordinates I and g is quite different from their use in electromagnetism.

7.5 The Conjugation of Time and Energy in Phase Space
Now that the surface of section~ has been endowed with a system of
canonically conjugate coordinates (/,g), one would like to complete
the job by adding one more pair, at least in the neighborhood of ~.
calling it (/1, g 1). The two most obvious candidates are the energy E
for 11, and the time t for g 1. The success of this endeavor depends on

96

The Surface of Section

calculatin g the relevant two-form s (7 .1) between E, t, and the coordinates in L. The part concerne d with t is easy, but E has to be treated
with some care.
Since each point on L is the starting point for a trajectory , we will
use the simple expedien t of defining g 1 = 0 on L, and setting g 1 = t
along each trajectory since leaving L. We can write 8t instead of 8g 1 ;
the displacem ent (8p, 8q) correspon ding to 8t is given by the vector
(jJ, q)8t, or in view of (2.2) by (- oH/oq, oH/op)8 t which will be
called 8 for simplicity's sake. We can now calculate its two-form Q
according to (7 .1) together with an arbitrary vector Ll in L. The result
is the product 8t [Llp(oH/o p) + Llq(oH/o q)]. Since L belongs to a
surface of constant energy, this change of H with the displacem ent Ll
vanishes, and Q(8, Ll) = 0.
The surface of constant energy H(p, q) = E is now endowed with
the coordinat es fz, [3, g 1, g 2 , g3, sufficient ly close to L. A change in any
one of these five coordinat es leads to well-defin ed displacem ents inside
L and along the trajectori es of energy E. The sixth and last coordinat e
in phase space has the job of changing the value of H(p, q) from E to
E + 8E. This new coordinat e f 1 will be chosen such as to have a vanishing value of Q with any displacem ent Ll inside L, whereas
Q(8f1, Llg 1) = 8E Llt. The only new kind of displacem ent in phase
space is in the direction 0 = (oH/op, oH/oq). The displacem nt correspondin g to a change inf1 is, therefore , a linear combinat ion of ewith
the five independ ent deviation s inside the constant energy surface, so
as to produce the correct values for Q.
The details are tedious to work out, and the end result is not of interest in itself. Of the six coefficien ts in the linear combinat ion, the
one that goes with 8g 1, i.e., with a vector in the direction
( - oH/oq, oH/op), remains arbitrary; the antisymm etry (7.2) of Q
allows only for five independ ent condition s, whereas six would be required for a unique determina tion.
This ambiguity is natural as can be seen even in the original coordinates (p, q): the two-form (7 .1) does not change, for example, if one
replaces p 2 by pz + qz while leaving all the other coordinat es as before. What does change, is the one-form p 8q , and that would affect
the value of the action integral S in (2.3). When the integral of the
one-form is taken over a closed loop, however, for example, a periodic
orbit, the ambiguity disappear s.
It is importan t to emphasiz e that the addition of f 1 = E and g 1 = t,
as canonical ly conjugate variables to the coordinat es in L, is generally
feasible only in the neighbor hood of L in phase space. As t increases ,
L (t) sweeps out the energy surface, and some parts of L (t) will eventually intersect L(O); but at no time will L(t) and L(O) fully coincide.

7.5 Conjugation of Time and Energy in Phase Space

97

This complication was already discussed in Section 7.3; it is all the
more remarkable that the transformation of ~ into itself, after correcting for the different return times, still conserves the two- form fl.
The special coordinates (E , t) in the neighborhood of a particular trajectory played an important role in calculating the determinant
D(q" q' E) in Section 2.4.
The construction in this section should be sharply distinguished
from another one which also presents E and t as an additional pair of
conjugate coordinates. The dimension of phase space now gets increased from 2n to 2(n + 1) where n is always the number of degrees
of freedom. This idea is already present in the expressions (1.8) and
(1.9) for the variation of the Lagrange action R, where the one-form
p 8q gets the extra term E 81. A similar enlargement of phase space was
used in Section 5.2 where the variable f', the mean motion of the Sun
acting as a time-dependent perturbation on the Moon-Earth-Sun system, was considered to be a new angle variable k with a corresponding
new action K to complete the pair. The resulting enlarged system was
thereby made conservative.
Including (energy, time) as a new pair in addition to (momentum,
position) is, of course, essential in special relativity, and leads again to
a conserved Hamiltonian system even though there might be timedependent forces. As an example, let us consider a charged particle in
an electromagnetic field, which is given by the vector potential
(A 0 , AI, A2, A 3 ) where each component is a given function of the time
variable x 0 = ct, and the Cartesian coordinates XJ. x 2 , x 3 ; cis the velocity of light. In order to find equations of motion that look like (2.2),
one needs a conjugate variable p 0 for x 0 , a new time-like variable r, and
a Hamiltonian function M(p0 , ... , p 3 , .xo•... , x 3 ). The equations of
motion have to yield the movement of an electric charge e in the combined electric and magnetic fields of the given vector-potential A,
equivalent to Newton's equation of motion for a particle of rest-mass
m 0 subject to the Lorentz force as in equations (18.1) and (18.2). If
these terms are not understood at this point, the reader is requested to
come back to this place after looking at Chapter 18 where the hydrogen
atom in a magnetic field is discussed at length.
The most convincing form of the Hamiltonian M is
M

= (po -

""

e

i =I

with a new variable r to play the role of time. If this expression is used
in (2.2) with M replacing Hand x replacing q, and the result is compared with the usual equations of motion for an electric charge, such
as (18.1), the following interpretation emerges: Since the system is

98

The Surface of Section

conservative, i.e., M does not depend on T, the value of M remains
constant and its value is nzd c2 . The variable T is the proper time of the
particle, i.e., the ordinary time measured in the instantaneous restframe, andp0 = E/c (cf. Garrod 1968).
In this form, the rest-mass mo stays constant because of the
equations of motion in an electromagnetic field. It may change only if
there are internal degrees of freedom; these work always in the proper
time T which is the natural time-like variable in the Hamiltonian M.
As an example, one can think of radioactive decay; e.g., the 'heavy
electron', alias p.-meson, decays into an ordinary electron with a probability which decreases with its speed, because the speed is measured
in the time-frame of the laboratory while the internal clock always runs
more slowly, as in the famous twin paradox of special relativity.
The end of this chapter may be the appropriate place to mention a
bit of particle physics that has a direct bearing on the question of chaos
in simple physical systems. The theoreticians of high-energy physics
have arrived at a consensus in recent years, whereby one or the other
of the non-Abelian gauge fields are able to explain the bewildering variety of elementary particles. These theories were first proposed by
Yang and Mills in 1954 to generalize Maxwell's theory of
electromagnetism which is an Abelian gauge field. But the new theories lead to non-linear field equations, although they are still amenable
to the techniques of perturbation theory.
Unfortunately, the effective coupling constants are outside the domain where the perturbation expansion can be expected to converge,
even if only asymptotically. A brute-force numerical assault on the
problem, lattice gauge theory, seems to be the only way to extract
quantitative results at this time; the work has been in progress for some
years. It seems almost inevitable that chaotic behavior is present in
these systems, and that no real understanding will be achieved until this
aspect of the problem is taken into account.
The first steps in this direction have been made by Savvidy (1982
and 1983) together with Martinyan and Prochorenko (1988). They
have studied the classical non-Abelian field equations in the simple
approximation where they are constant in space and depend only on
time. With three non-vanishing independent components of the field,
they obtain a rather ordinary-looking Hamiltonian system with three
degrees of freedom and a polynomial interaction. It can be studied by
the standard methods involving the surface of section (cf. the next
chapter), and is found to be chaotic.

CHAPTER 8

Models of the Galaxy
and of Small Molecu les

This chapter deals with some special models that were first discussed
by the astronomers who tried to understand the motion of stars in the
gravitational field of the Galaxy. The pioneering work was done by
George Contopoulos (1960) and some of his students; they were the
first to realize that the stellar trajectories in the gravitational potential
of a typical galaxy can be either integrable or chaotic depending on
their initial conditions. That discovery was crucial in understanding the
observed velocity distribution of stars in our solar neighborhood .
The work of Michel Henon and Carl Heiles from the early 1960s is
based on a special case which finally brought the idea of chaos home
to the physicists. As astronomers, these two authors, like their predecessors, were interested in understanding our galaxy, but they chose a
particular mathematical model for ease of computation while keeping
the essential features of the galactic environment. Their model has
become the testing ground for various general methods in the study of
chaotic dynamical systems. We shall discuss three of these: The
Birkhoff-Gustavson normalization, the analysis of singularities in the
complex-time plane, and the study of discrete algebraic transformations. The chemists have adopted the same model to describe the rnaion of the nuclei in a small molecule as shown in the spectrum of
molecular vibrations as well as in the transformation of molecules and
their reactions ( cf. Brumer 1981).

100

Models of the Galaxy and of Small Molecules

8.1 Stellar Trajectories in the Galaxy
Poincare reviewed the purely analytical approach to celestial mechanics
in the nineteenth century, and came to very disturbing conclusions: the
motion along conic sections, or even the more general movements in
the neighborhood of a periodic orbit, could no longer serve as a starting
point in many situations. It became necessary to face a great proliferation of periodic orbits, and to cope with trajectories which defied any
kind of simple repetitive pattern.
The only way to gain new insight was to carry out numerical calculations. This task was first taken up by Sir George Darwin (son of
Charles who had written The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man
) and F. W. Moulton, before World War I, and was then continued
primarily by Stromgren and his school in Copenhagen during the 1920s
and 1930s. This work and much of what followed is surveyed in the
Theory of Orbits by Szebehely (1967). Together with the work on
stellar trajectories in galaxies, this field, now called dynamical astronomy, is the modern version of celestial mechanics; Contopoulos (1979)
reviewed it for the benefit of the quantum-oriented physicists.
Since the gravitational force between stars decreases as the inverse
square of the distance, stars can never really get away from one another; but they don't hit one another either. Quite in contrast, the
molecules in a gas move freely most of the time when outside the short
range of their interaction; but they get close enough to one another
with reasonable frequency, so as to change their direction of motion
very drastically in a collision between only two of them. Stars move in
the integrated potential of the whole galaxy, and any close encounters
are prevented by the very long-range nature of their mutual attraction.
This situation is also found in a plasma, i.e., a fluid whose particles are
electrically charged rather than neutral as in ordinary gas and fluids.
The manner in which mass is spread through the Galaxy can be inferred from the observed distribution of stars in the sky. The
gravitational potential V(x, y, z) is then found from solving Poisson's
equation

where f..L is the mass density and G is the gravitational constant. Each
star moves as if alone in the fixed potential V ( cf. Ollongren 1965).

8.1 Stellar trajectories in the Galaxy

101

The exact shape of f.1. is not known; but it corresponds to a flat disk
with known radius in which the stars are fairly evenly distributed. An
important feature is the cylindrical symmetry, the fact that f.1. depends
only on p = (x 2 + y 2 ) 112 and z. Therefore, also V depends only on
p and z, and as a consequence the angular momentum M of a star with
respect to the z-axis, through the center of the Galaxy and at right angles to its plane, is a constant of motion.
The equations of motion are thereby reduced to two degrees of
freedom with the canonical pairs (pP, p) and (p2 , z), and the
Hamiltonian

2
2
M2
H(pP, P2 , p, z) = 2 (pP + Pz) + V(p, z) + - 2
(8.2)
2p

Notice that the mass of the star does not appear in this Hamiltonian
because it would multiply both the kinetic and the potential energy, and
was divided out. The momenta pP and Pz are, therefore, reduced to the
corresponding velocities, and M is the areal velocity of Kepler's second
law.
The nature of the stellar trajectories in the galactic potential V can
be found by observing their velocities in the solar neighborhood. According to the principles of statistical mechanics, the distribution in
phase space can depend only on the constants of motion. If there
aren't any besides the Hamiltonian (8.2), and the angular momentum
M, the stellar velocities in the meridian plane (p, z) have no preferred
direction, contrary to experience. There is then bound to be a constant
of motion F in addition to the energy H and the angular momentum
M. Since it is not clear what it should be in terms of the variables
Pp, Pz, M, p, z, the astronomers called it the third integral without
knowing exactly its origin.
The problem of the third integral was approached systematically in
the early 1960s, especially by Contopoulos and his students, using both
analytical and numerical tools. A collection of the relevant work can
be found in the volume edited by Contopoulos (1966). Many of the
results are directly applicable to the study of such disparate fields as the
design of particle accelerators, plasma physics, atoms in strong magnetic fields, and molecular vibrations. The work of Henon and Heiles
( 1964) gives the most economical account of this large body of research.

102

Models of the Galaxy and of Small Molecules

8.2 The Henon-Heiles Potential
The potential Win the preceding section has a basin or pit where most
of the stars in the galaxy are trapped. A high barrier due to the
centrifugal potential M 2 /2p 2 keeps the stars away from the center of
the galaxy; but since the gravitational attraction of the whole galaxy
vanishes at large distances, stars with sufficient energy can escape into
intergalactic space; a mathematical model for the combined potential
should have these features. The cylindrical geometry, however, is not
important any longer so that one might just as well replace (p, z) by the
Cartesian (x,y).
The model potential U(x,y) as a function of the position coordinates (x, y) should also be easy to evaluate, either analytically in a
proof, or numerically in a computation. All these requirements leave
us with a polynomial of third degree. Henon and Heiles chose a potential whose value is constant along the sides of an equilateral triangle,
on the straight lines, x = (y - 1) I
x = - (y - 1) I
and
y = -1/2, so that U(x ,y) is given by

The constant -1 I 6 is usually left out, so that the local minimum of U
at the origin has the value 0, while U = 1/6 along the sides of the
equilateral triangle. There are steep mountains beyond the three sides;
but the vertices of the triangle are mountain passes on whose far side
the potential decreases rapidly, and goes to -oo eventually, allowing the
particle to escape.
If the results of Henon and Heiles are applied to a real physical situation, the starting Hamiltonian would be

Notice the three physical constants: the mass m, the frequency w, and
the length a = mw 2 /A. which make of this Hamiltonian a complete
model for a non-linear system. The value of the parameter A. does not
indicate the strength of the non-linear coupling between the motions
in x and iny, but sets the length scale a. As pointed out in Section 3.6,
however, Planck's quantum h has now a non-trivial numerical value in
such a system if the three constants, m, w, and a, are used as physical
units.
The Henon-Heiles system shows a remarkable similarity to the
Toda lattice of Section 3.6. The simplest case is a tri-atomic molecule
in one dimension where n = 3 in (3.12), and the lattice is periodic so

8.2 The Henon-Heiles Potential

that q4 = q 1• Its configuration is decomposed into the center-of-mass
coordinate z = (q 1 + q2 + q3 )/3, and the two internal vibrational coordinates x = (2qt - q2- q3)12/3 andy= (q3 - qt)/2. The potential energy does not depend on z, so that the center-of-mass
momentum becomes a constant of motion whose value has no effect
on the internal degrees of freedom x andy. The kinetic energy is the
sum of the squares of the momenta corresponding to x, y, z.
The three-particle Toda lattice is now explicitly reduced to two degrees of freedom, exactly as it was tested by Ford and coworkers (cf.
Section 3.6). If one thinks of small-amplitude vibrations in a molecule,
it is reasonable to expand the exponential functions in the potential
energy of (3.12) in powers of x andy, and to stop the expansion at the
first term which goes beyond the quadratic. The resulting Hamiltonian
is the same as (8.3), which is the reason why the Toda lattice, coming
after the work of Henon and Heiles, was not expected to be integrable,
but rather chaotic at moderate energies. The non-integrability of the
truncated Toda-lattice was proven by Yoshida, Ramani, and
Grammaticos (1988).

8.3 Numerical Investigations
It would be difficult to get even an approximate idea of the dynamical

properties of the Hamiltonian (8.4) without looking first at many trajectories with the help of the surface of section. The symmetry of the
equilateral triangle suggests the vertical x = 0 for this purpose. The
equations of motion with the normalization m = 1, w = 1, and 'A = 1
can be integrated with any simple routine such as Runge-Kutta to a
sufficient accuracy and for many traversals.
An energy E is chosen, and a number of trajectories are computed.
The points of the traversal are plotted in the domain D(E) of the surf ace of section which is defined by the inequality v2 + 2 U( 0, y) < 2E.
Each trajectory is started at some arbitrary initial point Po = ( v0 , y 0 )
with x = 0 and u > 0 at the fixed energy E. The subsequent traversals
Pt = (v 1 ,yJ), P2, ... of x = 0 with u > 0 are obtained by numerical
integration. Either they line up on an apparently smooth curve, or they
scatter wildly throughout a portion of the domain D(E).
If the traversals line up nicely, the corresponding trajectory lies on
a torus in the energy surface; if the traversals cannot be accommodated
easily on a smooth curve, there is no invariant torus in phase space to
contain the trajectory. It would seem at first that the criterion for the
existence of a smooth curve through a finite number of points in a plane

104

Models of the Galaxy and of Small Molecules

is entirely a matter of individual taste. But in practice there is no doubt
about which of the situations applies to any particular trajectory. The
dichotomy seems always amazingly clear; nobody quibbles with the
conclusions of Henon and Heiles as drawn from the three Figures 12a,
13a, and 14a.
Figure 12a was calculated for E = 1/12; points belonging to the
same trajectory are connected by a smooth line, drawn by hand as it
were. Every trajectory at that energy seems to have a torus, although
the nesting of all these tori is not trivial. Several isolated points in the
surface of section are the centers of concentric closed loops that define
a basin or a mountain as in a topographic map. Between these mountains and basins, however, are separating lines with self-intersections;
they correspond in an ordinary pendulum to the motion that separates
the libration from the rotation around the point of suspension. The
approach to the point of self-intersection takes a very long time, or
equivalently, very many traversals with the surface of section. The
conclusion from Figure 12a is clearly that the system is integrable at
E = 1/12.
Figure 13a is computed for E = 1/8 which is still well below the
energy where escape from the inside of the equilateral triangle is possible. Yet, a large part of the surface of section is clearly ergodic;
amazingly, the points that scatter all over a portion of the domain
D(E) come from a single trajectory. This ergodic region in D(l/8)
coincides to some extent with the portions of D(l/12) where the
basins and mountains are meeting. The remaining concentric closed
loops in D(l/8), generally called islands, correspond quite closely to
the nested loops in D(l/12).
Part of the energy surface E = 1/8 is obviously covered with invariant tori, whereas the remainder is not. The boundary seems rather
sharp, or even smooth, although that is probably an illusion to be
checked by more elaborate calculations. Nevertheless, the area of the
ergodic portion in D(l/8) is quite well defined, and can be assigned a
numerical value by counting little squares in the figure.
Figure 14a presents the surface of section for the escape energy
E = 1/6; but only the pointy = 1, y = 0 could lead to the system actually leaving the equilateral triangle. It is highly unlikely for a particular trajectory to go through that unique point. Almost all of the
domain shows ergodic behavior; the exception consists of some tiny
loops near the centers of the earlier structures of nested tori. These
small islands can easily evade the notice of the investigator, because it
is again unlikely that the correct initial condition be found in a random
search. The element of area can serve as a probability measure for
finding a particular island.

Figure 15 The fraction of phase space in the Henon-Heiles model that is

The area p.(E) covered with invariant tori relative to the total area
of the domain D(E) is plotted in figure 15. The two straight lines were
obtained as a good fit from the numerical computations like the ones
in Figures 12a, 13a, and 14a. They demonstrate a remarkable empirical
fact: The Henon-Heiles model is practically integrable in the energy
range from 0 to about 1/10; from then on the area with ergodic behavior increases linearly with energy, until the whole energy surface is
ergodic at E = 1I 6.

8.4 Some Analytic Results
Since the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian (8.4) is the simplest conceivable
for a non-linear system with two degrees of freedom, no effort has
been spared to understand its properties by purely analytical considerations rather than with the help of numerical computations. Three
different approaches will be discussed briefly in the next sections, because they all have their analogs in quantum mechanics. Much work
remains to be done, however, to establish a better connection between
the classical and the quantal domain even in the limited confines of the
Henon-Heiles model.

8.4 Some Analytic Results

107

The present section shows how a systematic perturbation theory has
been devised by Gustavson (1966) on the basis of the earlier work by
Birkhoff (1927). In the next section, we will present the results of an
analysis by Chang, Tabor, and Weiss ( 1982), who examined for which
choice of parameters a Hamiltonian like (8.4) becomes integrable. A
third device was first invented by Henon (1969) and has since become
the basis for a large industry, both analytical and numerical. The ordinary differential equations of classical mechanics combined with the
use of the Poincare surface of section are replaced by a discrete, but
still area-preserving map.
Birkhoff's method is designed to examine the motion of a dynamical
system in the neighborhood of a point of stable equilibrium, like the
center of the equilateral triangle in the Henon-Heiles potential, or the
equilibrium configuration of a large molecule. The Hamiltonian is expanded in the momentum and position coordinates;. the lowest terms
are quadratic, and positive definite since otherwise the equilibrium is
unstable; they are diagonalized by a linear canonical transformation,
and reduced to
n

H2 =

L

(8.5)

)=I

The stable equilibrium reduces in lowest order to a set of oscillators
with the frequencies WJ- The awkward form of the Hamiltonian results
from the usual (p 2 + m 2 w2q 2 )/2m by the canonical transformation
p-+ p/(mw) 112 and q-+ q(mw) 112 . Bothp 2 and q 2 have the same dimension as Planck's quantum, and will eventually become multiples of
it.
A sequence of canonical transformations (cf. Section 2.2) is now
carried out with the help of the generating functions W3 , ... , WN ; the
new Hamiltonian is expanded in a power series with respect to the new
corrdinates p and q. The lowest term is kept exactly like (8.5), whereas
the higher-order terms, up to a power N, are made to depend only on
the combinations Pi = p} + q}. The system is then called normalized
to the order N. The remaining higher-order terms beyond N are assumed to be of no importance for understanding the properties of the
dynamical system.
The paper by Gustavson in The Astronomical Journal (1966) gives
a good explanation of the necessary algebraic manipulations. The
principle is not difficult, although some of the details are tricky. The
method will be further explained in Section 14.3.
The normalization procedure, and particularly the existence of additional constants of motion, depends on the numerical relations between the frequencies w1 . If there exist no integers k1 such that the

108

Models of the Galaxy and of Small Molecules

scalar product (k, w) = 0, the dynamical system has the n constants of
motion PJ = p} + q} in terms of the new coordinates. If the condition
(k, w) = 0 can be satisfied, however, and if, moreover, this can be done
by £ independent vectors k, then there are n - £ independent combinations of the PJ that are constants of motion, in addition to the
Hamiltonian itself.
Since w 1 - w 2 = 0 for the Hamiltonian (8.4), there is one more integral of motion F besides the Hamiltonian. F has only quadratic terms
in the normalized coordinates; it can be written as a power series expansion in the original coordinates by inverting the canonical transformations generated by W3 , ... , WN. The normalization and the
construction ofF was carried out by Gustavson for the Henon-Heiles
Hamiltonian ( 8.4), up to and including the eighth order in the
u, v, x, y. The coefficients for the expansion of the normalized
Hamiltonian, for the generating functions, and for the additional constant of motion F in the original coordinates are listed. If the
Henon-Heiles model were integrable, the expansion for F could be
expected to converge; but a look at the coefficients says otherwise;
several of them in eighth order are between 10 and 100, whereas in
fourth order the largest coefficient is 5/3, and all the others are below
1 in absolute value.
Even when all the terms above the eighth are truncated, however,
the expression for F gives a good account of the surface of section
x = 0 wherever there are invariant tori. The Figures 12b, 13b, and 14b
give the level lines, F(u, v, x = 0, y) = constant, in the ( v, y) plane with
the energy held atE= 1/12, 1/8, and1/6 as in the Figures 12a, 13a,
and 14a. The islands are in good correspondence; but nothing in the
new figures yields any indication of the chaotic regions in the earlier
Remarkably, as will be dicussed later, the quantal
ones.
Henon-Heiles model suggests that the formal constant of motion F has
still some validity in the classically chaotic regions of phase space.
The Birkhoff-Gustavso n construction has been applied to other
problems where it yields similar results, e.g., the hydrogen atom in a
magnetic field (cf. Section 18.2). Like all the other schemes for removing perturbing terms from the Hamiltonian with the help of
canonical transformations, the task is accomplished by an averaging
process that necessarily leads to the infamous small denominators.
Deprit and coworkers (1969) have made the method particularly
transparent; their work also casts the whole procedure into a recursive
algorithm that is free of the coefficient-matching of Birkhoff and
Gustavson.

8.5 Integrability with Kowalevskaya and Painleve

109

8.5 Searching for Integrability with Kowalevskaya and Painleve
The numerical evidence of the Henon-Heiles calculations clearly indicates that the Hamiltonian (8.4) does not have a global third integral.
Could one have known this in advance? Or since we know the final
outcome of such an investigation is it possible to look at Hamiltonians
similar to (8.4 ), and single out the integrable ones? This question is
completely analogous to the question of Sofia Kowalevskaya concerning the motion of a gyroscope held outside its center of mass, and subject to the Earth's gravitational field ( cf. Section 4.1). Her method was
applied to Hamiltonians of the Henon-Heiles type by Chang, Tabor,
and Weiss (1982). This section presents the bare outline, so as to give
at least a hint of the ideas involved in this type of analysis.
The main idea is to investigate the equations of motion in the complex domain, i.e., to allow the components of the momentum and of the
position as well as the time to have complex values, and then to find
out where the singularities of a typical solution are located in the
complex-time plane. As a general rule, integrability requires an exceptionally simple structure of singularities; the criterion is the socalled Pain/eve property: only isolated poles of bounded order. The
reader should be forewarned, however, not to expect any clear-cut and
sweeping theorems.
Let us start with the equations of motion in their Hamiltonian form
(2.2). If the trajectory starts in (p0 , q0 ) at the time t0 , it is natural to
expand the right-hand sides as power series in the components of
p - p 0 , q - q0 , as well as t - t0 , and to assume that each power series
converges within a circle of non-vanishing radius in the complex plane.
The solution is then uniquely determined as a convergent power series
with respect to (t - t0 ) inside the intersection of all these circles of
convergence.
The trajectory is now defined in the complex-time plane, and can
be continued analytically until it collides with one or more of the
singularities. In order of increasing seriousness, they can be poles, algebraic branch points like a square root, transcendental branch points
like a logarithm, or finally an essential singularity such as exp( - 1/t)
whose expansion in powers of t has negative powers going to - oc. The
location of some of these singularities may depend on the initial values
p 0 , q0 , t0 of the trajectory; if so, they are called movable singularities,
and our main task is to find where and of what kind they are, and
whether they have the Painleve property.
The most general potential with second- and third-order terms, first
investigated by Contopoulos, leads to the Hamiltonian,

(8.7b)

The next step is elementary, but it has to be carried out with great
care. Suppose that our trajectory has a singularity at the complex time
t0 . We try to find the expansion for x andy in powers of T = t - t0 .
The most singular, i.e., the algebraically smallest, powers of T are
written as
(8.8)
where y > 0. The a and b terms in (8.8) are called the leading terms
because they are the most singular, while the c and d terms are called
the resonance terms for somewhat obscure reasons.
First only the leading terms are inserted into (8.7), and the most
singular contributions are matched on either side of the = sign. The
linear terms on the right-hand sides of (8.7) cannot compete with the
non-linear ones. Equation (8.7a) gives f3 = -2, but (8.7b) permits two
cases. Case 1 is obviously a = f3, while case 2 allows a > f3. Matching
the coefficients in front of the powers of T leads in case 1 to the conditions A.b = -3, A.a 2 = b2 - 6b, whereas in case 2 one has
a(a- 1) = -2A.b, b = f3(f3- 1) = 6 with a remaining undetermined.
At this point one could pursue each case separately in order to find
the power series expansions for x andy starting with the leading terms.
If we want to have only poles in the solution, it is important to require
that a in case 2 be an integer; the value of A. is thereby severely restricted, a first indication that not every Hamiltonian (8.6) is sufficiently well behaved. (Actually, this condition on a will be relaxed
later on, but for the time being there is no harm in adopting it.) In this
manner one ends up with one particular trajectory, whereas there ought
to be four free parameters for a general solution of (8.7). The time to
represents only one parameter; the remaining three come from the
resonance terms.
If the full expressions (8.8) are inserted into (8.7), the leading terms
have already been chosen to cancel the most negative powers of T. The
next terms in (8.7) involve the time derivatives of the resonances on
the left, and the products of the leading terms with the resonance terms
on the right. These terms in (8. 7) cancel, provided the coefficients c
and d satisfy two linear equations; and that in turn requires the van-

ishing of the corresponding determinant. In this way, the necessary
conditions for the exponent y in the resonance terms are established.
For each acceptable value of y the linear equations for c and d can be
solved, yielding one free parameter in the solution of the equations of
motion.
Case 1 yields either y = 6 or (y -2)(y- 3) = -6(1 + 1IA). Both
solutions of this quadratic equation for y have to be positive integers
in order to obtain the required three parameters. Thus, we find a set
of possible negative values for A in case 1. The analysis of case 2 is
different: the coefficient a in (8.8) is already arbitrary, corresponding
to y = 0; there is again y = 6; the third value of y is such that
a' = a + y is the second solution of a(a - 1) = -12A, i.e., both solutions have to be > -2 and integers, leading to a restriction on A.
To continue the argument to its successful conclusion, it is now
necessary to construct the full expansion starting from the values for
the exponents a, /3, andy in (8.8) which have just been found. There
are many tricky details that the reader has to study in the original paper. The present discussion is meant to stimulate interest in a totally
different and potentially revealing approach to the question of
integrability in Hamiltonian systems.
The final conclusion shows the following four cases where the
Hamiltonian (8.6) is integrable:
( 1) A = 0 decouples the motions in x andy;
(2) A = -1 with JL = 1 also becomes separable when the coordinates x + y and x - y are used;
(3) A = -1/6 has the "third" constant of motion

F = x 4 + 4x 2y 2 - 4u(uy- vx) + 4JLX 2y + (4JL -l)(u2 + JLX2);
( 4) A = -1 I 16 with JL = 1I 16 is also integrable, but the expan-

sions in the complex-time plane require algebraic branch points.

It would have been close to impossible to find the last two cases
without the analysis in the complex-time plane that was first used by
Kowalevskaya. The reader will find more details in the work of
Yoshida (1983), in the article by Newell, Tabor, and Zeng (1987), and
in the recent monograph by Tabor (1989).

8.6 Discrete Area-Preserving Maps
Investigating the Poincare surface of section for an arbitrary
Hamiltonian requires the numerical integration of the trajectories.
Since most of them are inherently unstable in a chaotic system, no

112

Models of the Galaxy and of Small Molecules

computational scheme is able to provide more than a few dozen intersections with the surface of section, say x = 0 as in Section 8.3. The
quality of any calculation can always be checked by running the trajectories backward in time: let Po= (vo.Yo), P1 = (Vt.YI), ... ,
Pn = (Vn, Yn) be the consecutive intersections; then one could start a
trajectory at p' 0 = ( - Vm Yn); the subsequent intersections are
p'l = ( - Vn- t.Yn- 1), ... , p'n = ( - vo,Yo) to the precision of the
round-off error.
Even without this technical difficulty, it is often prohibitively expensive to run the integration routine over thousands of initial points
P0 , because each intersection may require several hundred integration
steps in order to approximate the continuous variation of the coordinates along the trajectory. The fine structure of the Poincare map
cannot be displayed, unless the map is drastically simplified. Instead
of the real trajectories that belong to a well-defined Hamiltonian such
as (8.7), an artificial transformation from the (x,y) plane into itself is
studied.
Froeschle (1968) and Henon (1969) were among the first to try out
this strategy in order to overcome the computational limits of the earlier calculations concerning the Hamiltonian (8.6). The choice of a
map (x,y) - (x 1,y1) was dictated by the paramount requirement that
the element of area remain invariant, or equivalently that the Jacobian
c3(x 1,y1)/c3(x,y) = 1. Moreover, the map had to look like a rotation
in the neighborhood of the origin, imitating the Poincare map in the
neighborhood of a point of stable eqilibrium such as the center of the
equilateral triangle in the Henon-Heiles potential. Finally, the simplest
non-linear term was added in order to achieve the most economical
numerical procedure.
After eliminating all trivial parameters, the following transformation T is found to be the most general when no more than quadratic
terms are allowed,
x 1 = x cos a - (y - x 2 ) sin a ,
(8.9)
y 1 = x sin a + (y - x 2 ) cos a ,
where a is the only non-trivial parameter left. This map has the further
advantage that its inverse is given by similar quadratic formulas, as one
can check immediately. Moreover, the fixpoints of T, P., 1'3, T4 can
be calculated explicitly by solving the corresponding algebraic
equations.
The resulting structure of islands, i.e., smooth invariant curves, and
of areas where the consecutive points of transformation Po, P1, P2, ...
scatter chaotically, is shown in Figure 16, where cos a = .24. Theresemblance to Figure 12 is quite striking; but certain fine details can

of small subsidiary islands and the approach of the large island within
.00001 of the fixpoint. The detailed structure could easily have gone
unnoticed in a cruder calculation, but then quantum mechanics might
ignore it knowingly, as we shall see later.
This map, sometimes called the Henon map, has been investigated
very intensively during the last decade in a slightly more general version
which was also proposed by Henan (1976). The transformatio n

angle a in (8.9) is related to ll in (8.10) through
( 1 + JL) 112 = 2 sin 2a/2.
When e < 1, the map is a good model for a dynamical system with
dissipation. As the the map is iterated, the original area of any portion
of phase space becomes smaller by a factor e at each step. The contraction, however, does not lead to a set of points whose diameter decreases indefinitely, but rather to a fractal set with dimension larger
than 1. The consecutive points P0 , P 1, .... eventually get ever closer to
this set, which has, therefore, been called a strange attractor; they move
around this fractal without ever converging to a limit.
Since the volume in phase space is conserved, this kind of phenomenon is strictly excluded from Hamiltonian mechanics, which is the
central theme of this book. The transformatio n (8.10) is of interest

8.6 Discrete Area-Preserving Maps

115

because area conservation appears as the formal limit of decreasing
dissipation. Moreover, the opposite limit, e = 0, is perhaps the bestknown map of the straight line into self, the so-called logistic map,
y ..... y 1 = 11. - y 2 ; the variable x simply takes on the previous value of
y, and can be ignored.
The map (8.9) has been studied in great detail and many of its
mathematical properties have been established in the form of bona fide
theorems which are not easy to prove at all. The reader has to work
through a great many papers to get acquainted with the terminology
and the techniques of this field. Recent surveys were written by
Grebogi, Ott, and Yorke (1987), as well as Schuster (1988). One
general conclusion, however, is worth mentioning: the transition from
the logistic map to the Henon map (8.9) is very complicated, and the
former is not a very useful guide to the latter. The absence of an
attractor in Hamiltonian systems, even a strange one, is responsible for
some entirely different situations in phase space, and puts these systems into a class all by themselves.
As a final comment on the progressive reduction from conservative,
to dissipative, to the logistic map, the ultimate link in this chain are
maps of the logistic kind, but considered in the complex plane. This
work goes back to the French mathematicians Fatou (1906) and Julia
(1918) in whose honor these maps are called Julia maps. Their properties are astounding and have been studied in great computational and
artistic detail, e.g., by Peitgen and Richter (1986). As in the analysis
of Kowalewskaya and Painleve, the recourse to the complex domain
again reveals itself as fundamental for a genuine understanding. This
conclusion becomes particularly evident when the logistic map (e = 0
in 8.10) is investigated as a function of the complex parameter 11.; its
general behavior is best understood with the help of the Mandelbrot set
(Mandelbrot 1980).

CHAPTER 9

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

Chaotic behavior in a dynamical system is most easily understood as a
breakdown of the invariant tori due to the perturbations. The KAM
theorem deals with this process of disintegration and shows that it is
gradual. The resulting situation in phase space, to be called soft chaos,
is smooth wherever the tori are intact, but it has many rough spots that
are associated with resonances or phase-locking. This phenomenon
happens when two degrees of freedom get stuck with the ratio of their
frequencies given by a rational number. Soft chaos can be explained
by estimating the size of the domain of phase space where phase-lock
occurs as a function of the perturbation strength.

9.1 The Origin of Soft Chaos
The key problems in mechanics are integrable: the motion of the planets around the Sun in astronomy, the symmetric heavy gyroscope in
mechanics, the hydrogen atom in physics, and the hydrogen-molecule
ion in chemistry. It is tempting to reduce the more complicated problems to these standard cases, and the method to carry out this reduction
is perturbation theory. We have discussed the three-body problem of
Moon-Earth-Sun in some detail in order to bring out the difficulties of
such an approach and to suggest at least one alternate route, Hill's
theory of the Moon. This chapter is meant to explain how perturbation
theory breaks down and what is left of the old integrable structure of
phase space.

9.1 The Origin of Soft Chaos

11 7

The pictures for the surface of section in the Henon-Heiles model
show clearly how the smooth intersections of the invariant tori at low
energies give way to isolated islands in a sea of chaotic behavior as the
energy increases. Each island consists of nested simply closed curves
with a single point at the center, which corresponds to a very special
periodic orbit, comparable to a soliton. The motion in the neighborhood of this periodic orbit is stable; the intersections of a neighboring
trajectory with the surface of section stay on one of the closed curves.
Stable periodic orbits are indigenous to mechanical systems; they
are a generic feature as we argued at the end of Chapter 6, in contrast
to integrability, which is highly exceptional. Stable periodic orbits are
the best we can hope for as perturbations are allowed to destroy part
of the invariant tori that characterize the integrable systems. The main
question now concerns the extent of a particular island as it is saved
from the floods of chaos.
Periodic orbits show up in the surface of section as a finite set of say
n isolated points whose locations line up again on a simply closed curve.
This last claim is, of course, moot, because any finite set of points in a
plane can be lined up on a smooth curve; but a close look shows an
ordered pattern of islands belonging to the same stable periodic orbit;
it clearly arises from some underlying simple loop and is all that's left
over from the original invariant torus. The periodic orbit jumps from
one point in the finite set to the next in a well-defined manner, such
as skipping every other point; thus, it runs around this simple loop a
number of, say m, times before returning to the first point. Figure 16
shows this situation with n = 5 islands, which are visited by the periodic orbit in m = 2 turns around the underlying closed curve.
The physical interpretation of this phenomenon is made in terms of
a resonance between the two degrees of freedom of the dynamical system. An integrable system is full of resonances since every pair of integers (m, n) yields a periodic orbit, as we saw in Section 6.2. Only few
of them are effective, however, in capturing the neighboring trajectories the way it happens in Figure 16. Indeed, a whole area of the surface of section in Figure 16 imitates the same 5:2 repeating pattern as
the periodic orbit. This phenomenon is called phase-lock: the phase
angle of the first degree of freedom is locked in step with the phase of
the second degree of freedom, and cannot be shaken loose by modifying the starting positions and momenta.
The capture of the trajectories in the neighborhood of a periodic
orbit is the origin of chaos, because it is impossible to fit many bands
of islands into a smooth overall foliation of the energy surface, i.e., a
complete covering with non-intersecting manifolds of lower dimension
such as the invariant tori. On the other hand, the very existence of the

118

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

islands indicates a local kind of integrability whose usefulness depends
on the extent of the island. The main purpose of this chapter is to estimate the size of a particular set of islands. If they do not cover the
whole surface of section, one can assume that the remainder is chaotic.
In a somewhat mysterious fashion, the old foliation by invariant tori is
not completely destroyed; the mixed situation, where some invariant
tori and whole islands are left over in phase space, will be called soft
chaos.
This term is entirely devoid of mathematical precision, and its domain of applicability is only bounded on one side by the integrable
systems and on the other side by hard chaos. The majority of
Hamiltonian systems belongs to the category of soft chaos; the prime
example is the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field: it is integrable both
for a vanishing field and for very strong fields, so that it never quite
detaches itself from integrability. Most research nowadays deals with
softly chaotic dynamical systems, because they arise quite naturally
when one starts with an integrable system like coupled linear oscillators
and adds a sufficiently smooth perturbation such as the cubic potential
in the Henon-Heiles model.
In spite of all this work, soft chaos is understood only in some of its
local features, while no more than superficial and general arguments
can be given for the global characteristics. Just as one cannot say easily
whether a particular dynamical system is integrable or not, so nobody
has been able as yet to offer a good overall description of phase space
with soft chaos. That may be the basic reason why the connection with
quantum mechanics is still so poor; the failure is as much on the classical as on the inherently more subtle quantum side.

9.2 Resonances in Celestial Mechanics
By far the most striking resonance is known to everybody, although its
explanation was only given by Lagrange (1764) in response to a prize
question of the French Academy of Sciences; the 28-year-old author
was awarded the prize, but he went back to the problem in 1780 to get
better agreement with observations. Since the Moon turns always the
same side toward the Earth, her rotation around her own axis is obviously synchronized with her motion around the Earth. But these two
frequencies do not have the same value by accident, because otherwise
they would differ by a small amount, and we would get to see the far
side of the Moon after many years. The Moon is elongated toward the
Earth, leading to spin-orbit coupling and to a complete phase-lock.

9.2 Resonances in Celestial Mechanics

119

Another example of a resonance was well known to the observers
before it was finally explained by Laplace. Its origin is a numerical
coincidence between seemingly unrelated periods; the period of Jupiter
around the Sun is 12 years while the period of Saturn is 30 years; the
exact value of their ratio is .40268677, very close to 2:5. The orbits
of both planets are very close to the ecliptic; they also carry most of the
angular momentum in the solar system. If one ignores all the other
planets, one ends up with another three-body problem, but of a quite
different nature compared with the Moon-Earth-Sun system.
Molecular vibrations are full of such resonances; but the comparison with the Helium atom is more appropriate. The mass of Jupiter is
about 1I 1000, and the mass of Saturn is about 1/4000 of the solar
mass, while the mass of the electron is about 1/8000 of the mass of the
He-nucleus. As emphasized in Section 4.2, however, the main difference is the strength of interaction, which goes as the product of the
masses in astronomy, rather than the product of the electric charges in
physics and chemistry.
The eccentricities of the Kepler orbits are moderate by the standards of the solar system, 0.048 for Jupiter and 0.056 for Saturn. They
play the crucial role in the resonance, however; if they were zero, the
interaction between the two planets would depend only on the difference of the polar angles cp1 - cf>s, and the peculiar combination
1/; = 5cps - 2cp1 would never come up. The exact ratio of the frequencies ws/ WJ yields 880 years for 1/; to change by 2'1T. The small perturbation with this angular dependence is able to build up more effectively
than larger perturbations with shorter periods.
Let each planet be confined to the ecliptic; its coordinates with respect to the Sun are the osculating elements in the conjugate pairs
(A, f) for the energy and the mean anomaly and (M, g) for the angular
momentum and the direction of the perihelion (cf. Section 4.4). The
center-of-mass motion is eliminated, taking away two degrees of freedom; the total angular momentum M 1 + Ms is conserved, and the perturbation depends only on the difference g1 - gs; only three degrees
of freedom are left. Each planet gets one for moving in its own elliptic
orbit, and the third degree of freedom allows for trading angular momentum back and forth, and thereby changing the individual eccentricities.
Formulas (4.3) and (4.4) have to be inserted into the gravitational
potential between Jupiter and Saturn with the help of the expressions
for A and M just following (4.7). The critical angle 1/; = 5cps- 2rp1
appears only in terms proportional to at least three powers of the eccentricities, and thus smaller by a factor (1/20) 3 = 1/8000 than the
leading term in the perturbation. Calculating the positions requires two

120

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

time integrations, or equivalently two divisions by the small denominator 5ws- 2w1 whose period is 880 years compared with the basic
periods of 12 and 30 years. Therefore, the perturbation gets boosted
by a factor somewhere between 30 2 and 75 2 •
The complete theory of the Jupiter-Saturn resonance is difficult
because the ratio of their semimajor axes is more than 1/2 so that any
expansion in this parameter converges poorly. The inequalities of 20'
for Jupiter and 48' for Saturn were easily observed by the naked eyes
of Brahe and Hevelius. The center of mass for Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn
lies outside the Sun most of the time so that the Sun's motion is not
negligible.
A famous example of resonance in the solar system may be more
directly connected with the phenomenon of chaos. It was noted by
Kirkwood in 1866 that the periods of asteroids in the belt between Mars
and Jupiter are such as to avoid any resonance with Jupiter. These are
the famous Kirkwood gaps of which the most glaring correspond to the
ratios 2:1 and 3:1 for Jupiter's period to the asteroid's period (cf.
Froeschle and Scholl1982). Somewhat less conspicuously missing are
the ratios 5:2, 5:3, 7:2.
It is not clear whether a resonance always has a destabilizing effect.
Our understanding of the Kirkwood gaps is incomplete at best; the
situation is reminiscent of the gaps in the rings of Saturn, which are
presumably due to the resonances with some of Saturn's satellites. The
doubts in all these explanations have to do with phase-lock, and were
first pointed out in 1812 by Gauss. The asteroid Pallas, one of only
four known at that time, has a period ratio close to 18:7 with Jupiter.
Gauss thought that this coincidence would tie down the motion of
Pallas in the same way as the Moon's rotation is locked to its orbit
around the Earth. Rather than make the motion more precarious, the
resonance provides extra phase space in which to absorb small irregular
noise-like perturbations.

9.3 The Analogy with the Ordinary Pendulum
Soft chaos will now be approached starting from an integrable system
with two degrees of freedom. The action-angle coordinates for the
unperturbed system are the canonical pairs (M, cp), (N, lf;). The perturbation does not depend explicitly on time, so that the Hamiltonian
reduces to
H = Ho(M, N) + ;

orders of perturbation.

periodic orbit with frequency ratio k/ f, i.e., the neighborhood of the
values M=M,., N=N,. where

The period of this orbit is 2'1T I wo which would be 60 years in the case
of the Jupiter-Saturn resonance where k/ f = 5/2. The orbit in a cp

0 :5 cp, 1/; :5 2'1T with opposite sides identified as in Figure 18, or in the
unlimited ( cp, 1/;) plane as in Figure 19; in both cases, one has a straight
line at an inclination 2/5, not necessarily through the origin.
The first step in dealing with this resonance is a shift of the origin
and a linear transformation of the axes in the action-angles variables.
The origin of the (M, N) plane is moved into (M,, N,). The angles
( ¢, 1/;) are transformed into ( ¢', 1/; 1 ) so that the unperturbed periodic
orbit is given by ¢' = constant. Since 1/;' becomes the coordinate along
the periodic orbit and increases linearly with time at the rate w 0 , we
will take the term w 0 t out of 1/; 1 • The canonical transformation is carried out with the help of the generating function
w = (M, + eM' - A.N)cp + (N,- kM' + KN)lj;- N' Wo t, (9.3)
which has the same mix of the new actions (M', N 1 ) and old angles
( cp, 1/;) as Win the discussion of Section 5.3; the transformation is given
by the same formulas (5.3).
The old actions are then given in terms of the new ones by

while the old angles are given in terms of the new ones by

(9.5)

where Kf - 'Ak = 1, which also guarantees the conservation of area in
both planes, (M, N) and (cp, 1[;).
The exact values of " and 'A are left open for the moment, although
they have to be integers, which is always possible as long ask and fare
relatively prime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1. The restriction
to integers is necessary so that the Fourier expansion of the perturbation in (9.1) is still valid. Taking the time derivatives in (9.5) shows
that ;p' = f;p- k~ = fw1 - kwz = 0, and ~~ = - A;p + K~- WO
= - 'Aw 1 + ""'Z - w0 = ( - 'Ak + Kf)w 0 - w0 = 0. Therefore, both
cf> 1 and 1./;' remain constant along the periodic orbit as long as there is
no perturbation.
If the formulas (9.4) and (9.5) are inserted into (9.1), the exponent
in the perturbation becomes mcp + n\f; = (mK + n'A)<t>' +
(mk + nf)(\f; 1 + w0t).
The new integers m' = mK + n'A and
n' = mk + nf vary independently from -oo to +oo. The coefficients in
the Fourier expansion of the perturbation can be simplified by setting
Vm,n(M, N)~ Vm,nCMr. N,), since they vary slowly as functions of M and
N, and are, moreover, small compared with H 0 . They are also renumbered in terms of (m', n') rather than (m, n).
The first term in (9.1), the integrable part of the Hamiltonian H 0 ,
is expanded around the resonance by assuming that the values of M'
and N' are small. That requires taking first and second derivatives of
Ho with respect to M and Nat the resonance (Mr. N,); let these be
called Ht. H 2 , H 11 , ... and so on. The new unperturbed Hamiltonian is
given by (5.5); its constant term, H 0 (M,, N,), can be dropped; the
linear terms cancel, as can be checked without difficulty; to terms of
second order, the transformed Hamiltonian (9.1) becomes

further if necessary. Before indulging in more drastic simplifications,
however, one has to ask: Is there still a periodic orbit in the neighborhood of the resonance when the perturbation is taken into account, and
if so, where exactly is it located ?
The answer is by no means obvious. Proving the existence of a periodic orbit became an important part of Poincare's work in celestial
mechanics; his last scientific paper (Poincare 1912) deals with this
problem, and he shows in great detail how he failed to come to a
mathematically rigorous result; his theorem was proven the following
year by Birkhoff (1913). We will discuss an approximate solution for
the trajectories of (9.6) without trying to justify the procedure by more
than crude physical reasoning. Our purpose is to give a simple picture
for the existence and size of islands around a periodic orbit.
The main argument is that any term in the perturbation with a
non-vanishing variation in "If; + w0 t gets averaged out to zero; only the
terms with n = 0 are important in lowest approximation. The summation over n in (9.6) is, therefore, left out at first, leaving us with the
quadratic terms in M and N, and a perturbation that depends only on
cf>. Nothing essential is lost if only the terms m = ± 1 are taken into
account, and all the others are dropped. Thus, the potential energy in
(9.6) becomes simply e I Vt,o I cos(cf> + cf>o), where cf>o is the phase of
the complex coefficient V1,O·
The two degrees of freedom can now be separated in this simplified
Hamiltonian. Since the angle "If; does not occur at all, N becomes a
constant of motion. The conjugate pair (M, cf>) is governed by the same
Hamiltonian as the ordinary pendulum,

where Mo = - BN/A.

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

The periodic orbit has not been lost completely; corresponding to
the ordinary pendulum, the stable equilibrium at M = Mo ,
cp = TT - ¢ 0 , and the unstable equilibrium at M = Mo , cp = cf>o are
solutions of the equations of motion that represent the same kind of
periodic orbit as in the unperturbed system. That is no longer true for
the other trajectories that result from the Hamiltonian (9.7); they do
not return to the same point in phase space after the period
To= 2TT/wo.
The reduced Hamiltonian (9.7) has to be kept at some constant
value E. Different trajectories of the same energy are distinguished by
different values of N. It is convenient, however, to discusss the
Hamiltonian (9.7) as if the third term was missing, and the individual
trajectories are characterized by the energy E. Thus, one arrives at
Figure 20, which is the surface of section 1/;=0 with the coordinates
(cp, M); it is in complete analogy to the phase space of the ordinary
one-dimensional pendulum.
Let us now construct a more realistic picture by taking the trajectories from the reduced Hamiltonian (9.7) back into the original (old,
unprimed) coordinates, with the help of (9.4) and (9.5); the reduced
(new) coordinates of (9.6) and (9.7) are written again with primes attached as in (9.3), (9.4), and (9.5). In particular, let us try to look at
the surface of constant energy E by adding the old action Nasa third
dimension to the old angles cp and 1/; in Figures 18 and 19. Since the
stable periodic orbit becomes the straight line ¢' = f cp - k-.f; = TT - ¢ 0
with N- Nr = -k M' o + KN, we can imagine Figure 20 as sliding
along this line! The representative point of some particular trajectory
in Figure 20 now becomes a trajectory in (¢, ..p, N) space, as shown in
Figure 21, looking like a square platter with lasagne al forno.
The surface of section cp = 0, with the old coordinates 1/; and N can
now be understood. Figure 20 slides k times through the plane cp = 0,
before it arrives at its starting configuration; also, it is reduced in size
appropriately to fill out the interval 0 ~ 1/; < 2TT, yielding k copies of
itself sitting next to one another. These k copies can finally be wrapped
into a ring because the angle 1/; is defined only modulo 2TT. The conjugate variable N can then be viewed as a radial coordinate. In this way,
one obtains a picture looking like Figure 16 in the Henon-Heiles model.
We will refer to Figure 16 as if it had been obtained from a
Hamiltonian with a 5:2 resonance.
The discussion in this section shows how a perturbation at a resonance frequency replaces the nested invariant tori with a chain of islands. The centers of these islands form a stable periodic orbit which
is surrounded by a new set of invariant tori. The islands are separated
from each other by an unstable periodic orbit; they are bounded by the

separatrix that forms the boundary between the vibrational and the
rotational trajectories of the pendulum, and self-intersects in the unstable periodic orbit. The original layered structure of invariant tori
continues to exist outside, and immediately adjacent, to the separatrix,
at least in this primitive picture.

9.4 Islands of Stability and Overlapping Resonances
The main features of Figure 16 are largely independent of its precise
construction; indeed, it could well have been obtained from a numerical computation of the trajectories in a circularly symmetric potential
that is perturbed by a force with five-fold symmetry as in an organic
molecule. A Poincare section on a radial line, i.e., plotting the radial
momentum pP versus the radial variable p when the azimuthal angle
8 = 0, may lead to a figure just like 16 (cf. also Section 6.1).
Notice that the lines of constant energy in the equivalent pendulum
of Figure 20 have an orientation: the closed loops go clockwise around
the stable equilibrium; the open trajectories have decreasing (increasing) angles cj/ according as M' > ( < )M' 0 . In Figure 16 the points in
each island jump from one island to the another by skipping the one in
between; thus there is a prevailing counter-clockwise drift for the
whole pattern; but the trajectories outside the islands that correspond
to the full rotations of the equivalent pendulum, inherit the increase
(decrease) of the angle cj/; therefore the outermost lines in figure 16
turn counterclockwise more slowly than the innermost. This situation
is consistent with the precession of the trajectories in a circularly sym-

metric potential of Figure lld, which is, therefore, maintained in spite
of the perturbation.
If the prevailing motion of the islands, 4'7T I 5 per Poincare section,
is taken out of Figure 16, the basic scheme for a mapping of a circular
annulus into itself appears. The outer and the inner rims turn in opposite directions, and, most importantly, the area of the map is conserved. Such a map is called a twist map, and plays a central role in
modern treatises on celestial mechanics ( cf. Siegel and Moser 1971;
Moser 1973 ), as well as the study of classical chaos. It will be discussed further at the end of this chapter.
The perturbation disturbs the structure of nested loops of Figure
lld. Each term in the perturbation of (9.1) gives rise to its own set
of islands, and difficulties are bound to arise when the islands from
different resonances get into each other's way as the strength of the
perturbation increases. They can no longer be separated from each
other by a layer of smooth tori such as on the outer and the inner
boundaries of the islands in Figure 16. The islands start to shrink and
are surrounded by a chaotic region in phase space
This interpretation of Figure 16 is demonstrated by the calculations
of Walker and Ford ( 1969) who investigated the Hamiltonian
H = H 0 (M, N) + aMN cos(2cj>- 21/;) + {3M 312 N cos(2cJ>- 31/;), (9.8)
where H 0 is of second degree in (M, N), while a and f3 are arbitrary real
coupling parameters. When f3 = 0 one finds Figure 22a with two islands surrounding the origin, while a = 0 yields Figure 22b with a belt
of three islands as expected from the analysis in the preceding section.
With both coupling parameters small enough, the two sets of islands
coexist, and are separated by a full invariant torus as shown in Figure
23a; everything looks as if the system were still integrable. When the
coupling parameters a and f3 become fairly large as in Figure 23b, the

two belts of islands are no longer separated by an invariant torus, but
each island is surrounded by a chaotic region.
The argument for the appearance of chaos because of the overlapping resonances can be made more specific with the help of the preceding section. The oscillatory region in the (M', q/) plane of Figure
20 becomes the set of islands in the ('1/;, N) plane of Figure 16. The
largest extent of this region is defined by the curve through the maximum of the potential energy in (9.7), and is given by
M' = ± 2(e I VI/A) 112 sin(cp'- cf>o)/2. Since this curve separates the
oscillatory and the rotatory regions of the phase space, it is called the
separatrix.
The arf~ contained inside the separatrix is f M' dcp' =
8 ( e I VII A) 2 . The corresponding tube (torus) in phase space cuts the
line cf> = 0 a total of k times so that the total area of the islands in the
surface of section becomes 8k(e I VI/ A) 112 . This area depends only
on the ratio k/ f because A is a quadratic function of (k, f). According
to the definition of A in (9.6), the quantity A/k 2 gives the change in
frequency w(M, N) with a change of the actions in the unperturbed
system as one moves away from the resonance. The :size of the islands
increases, therefore, with the strength of the perturbation, and depends
inversely on the derivative of the frequency with respect to the action,
iJw/iJI.
Another way of judging the effectiveness of the perturbation in
creating islands, emerges from studying the frequency ratio w t1 w 2 •
This ratio is basically the same for the whole island, because all the

points in it go through the same k/ t cycle of the resonance; this is one
form of phase-lock. The value of M' can be spread in the perturbed
system as much as 2(e I VVA) 112 around the resonance values
(Mr, Nr) without changing the frequency ratio, or equivalently, the
original actions can be changed by as much as ( 8M, 8N) = 4
(t,- k)M' = (t,- k)(e I VVA) 112 • If we go back to (3.3), we can
now calculate the change in the frequency ratio that such a change in
the actions would have caused in the unperturbed system,

measures the non-linearity of the Hamiltonian H 0 (M, N) transverse to
its gradient, i.e., in the direction where the frequency ratio changes.
If there are two active resonances (w1 1 , wz') and (w!", wz'') belonging to (k', t') and (k 11 , t"), each is embedded in an interval of
width given by (9.9). Chaos arises when these two intervals overlap;
this explanation of soft chaos has been pursued by Chirikov and his
school, and is generally called the resonance-overlap criterion (cf. the
reviews Zaslavskii and Chirikov 1972, and of Chirikov 1979). It allows
to estimate qualitatively how strongly a system can be perturbed before
it becomes softly chaotic. In practice, the overlap becomes critical already when intervals of only half the width (9.9) touch.

9.5 How Rational Are the Irrational Numbers?
Resonances are characterized by the fact that the ratio of two frequencies in the unpertubed system is a rational number, the ratio of two
integers. If the system without the perturbation is not degenerate, i.e.,
if the matrix of the first and second derivatives of H 0 (M, N) with respect toM and N in (9.9) does not vanish, the resonant points on the
energy surface H 0 (M, N) = E are exceptional, exactly as the rational
points are exceptional in the interval (0,1). Nevertheless, these points
are dense, and it is hard to see how one ever gets away from them;
equivalently it is not clear how one ever escapes the dire consequences
of even small perturbations Vk, e in (9.1) if they don't vanish for any
pair (k, f).
The salvation can only be sought in the non-rational, alias irrational,
numbers of which there are, of course, many more than rational ones.
One has to be at a safe distance from the rational numbers, however,
so as to avoid their destructive influence. In order to define such a
distance, the manner in which an irrational number can be approximated by a rational one has to be studied. Humanity has pondered this
problem ever since anybody tried to measure the diagonal of a sW!.are
or the circumferene of a circle. In the first case the nature of
is
at stake, and in the second the nature of the number 'TT. Although a
knowledge of continued fractions is not absolutely necessary for the
discussion of resonances, even a cursory discussion of this beautiful
subject will make everything better understood and will be useful in the
study of hard chaos of Section 20.2. For a detailed presentation cf.
textbooks on elementary number theory, e.g., Khintchine 1963;
Drobot 1964; Stark 1970.
Every real positive number a can be expanded in the form

v2

a

= a0 + - - - -1-1- - al+-----1

~+---

a3 + ...

where ao, a1, a2, a3, ... are positive integers with the exception of a0 ,
which can also be 0. The continued fraction for a is obtained by the
following algorithm: if x > 0, call [x] the largest integer that does not
exceed x; let ao = [a], a1 = a- ao , and a 1 = [1/ aJ]; now work out
recursively an+ 1 = an - an and an+ 1 = [1/ an+ J].
The reader will be immediately captured if not obsessed by continued fractions after trying out a few examples on a hand-held computer.

130

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

The continued fraction for a rational number is finite. For the diagonal
of the unit-square one finds that
= {1; 2, 2, 2, 2, .... }; one of
Lagrange's great achievements was to show that the necessary and
sufficient condition for a continued fraction to be periodic is for a to
be a quadratic (irrational) number, i.e., the solution of a quadratic
equation with integer coefficients like a2 = 2.
The next example takes Euler, both to figure out numerically and
then to prove rigorously: for the base of the natural logarithms, he
found that
e = 2.71828 18284 = {2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, .... }.

The number '" seems to defy any simple rule since it yields
{3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 84, 2, ... };
in case the reader should be worried by the many occurrences of 1, it
was shown by Gauss that if a is chosen at random in the interval
(0, 1), then the probability for an to be in the interval (x, x + dx) is
given by dx/((1 + x) log 2) for large n; the domain 1/2 <an< 1
leading to an+ 1 = 1 has a probability of 42%.
Celestial mechanics provides the oldest and most significant practical applications of continued fractions. At issue are the ratios between
the solar, lunar, and planetary periods; there is no reason why they
should be simple; but the authors of antique texts have always expressed these ratios in rational numbers, for both technical as well as
philosophical reasons. Nowadays, one looks up the relevant periods
as obtained from the best observations, given in mean solar days, and
calculates the continued fraction.
The Astronomical Almanac for 1987 gives 365.242191 days for the
tropical year (equinox to equinox) and 29.530589 days for the synodic
month (new moon to new moon) for a ratio of
12.3682663 = {12; 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 17, 3}. For the truncated continued
fraction {12; 2, 1, 2, 1, 1} = 12 + 7/19 = 235/19 = 12.368421, one
can say that after one Metonic cycle of 19 years = 6939.601 days the
new moon is about 2 hours late because 235 months take 6939.688
days. The Islamic year is defined as 12 synodic months so that the
Islamic calendar is already ahead of the Christian calendar by 7 months
after 19 Christian years; the Islamic calendar gains about 3 years for
every Christian century. The Jewish calendar makes a compromise by
decreeing a cycle of 12 short years interspersed with 7 long ones. The
full
length
of
the
continued
fraction
yields
12 + 376/1021 = 12.3682664 which is already the full accuracy of 7
decimals; a total of (only) 1021 years is required to bring about the
near complete coincidence of the two calendars!
When the continued fraction of an irrational number a is truncated
at the n-th term, a rational number Pnl qn is obtained which is a partie-

9.5 How Rational Are the Irrational Numbers?

ularly good approximation, and is therefore, called the n-th convergent
of a. The integers Pn and % are calculated by the recursion formulas
Pn + I = an+ IPn + Pn- I ' qn + I = an+ lqn + qn- I ' (9.11)
with the initial values Po = ao, qo = 1, PI = a1 ao + 1, QI = a1. The
even-numbered convergents form a monotonically increasing sequence
that converges to a from below, while the odd-numbered convergents
converge monotonically to a from above. Compared with any other
rational pI q the convergents are distinguished because they satisfy the
inequality

Ia - pI q I < 1I 2q 2 .

(9.12)

In contrast to this result, notice that if the integer q is fixed, it is generally not possible to get closer to a than 1l2q.
All these propositions are easy to prove, as is the more precise estimate I a- Pnlqnl < 1lqnqn + 1 < 1lan + IQ~, where we have used
Qn + 1 >an+ IQn· The n-th convergent is, therefore, particularly good
when an+ 1 is large; e.g., in the ratio (tropical year)l(synodic month)
of the preceding paragraph one has a6 = 17 so that p 5l qs = 23 5 I 19
is within 1I (17 x 19 x 19) ~ .00016 of the correct value. A similar
case is 'TT where a 2 = 15 so that pd q1 = 2217 is good to
1/(15 x 7 x 7)~.00136; and even more unexpect1~d is a4 = 292 so
that P31 q3 = 3551113 is within .00000027 of 'TT.
The additional occurrence of a 12 = 14 and of a 21 = 84 in the continued fraction for 'TT makes one suspicious that 'TT may be so close to the
rational numbers that a torus with this frequency ratio might be easily
destroyed by the nearby resonances. In fact, in order to guard against
resonances, one would like to find numbers a where the difference
I a- plq I never falls much below the value 1/2q2 ,. which is always
realized by the convergents for every irrational number.
Liouville gave a simple and constructive proof to show: If a is the
root of the equation co:xN + c 1xN- 1 + .... + cN = 0 where
co, c1, ... , CN are integers, and c0 #:- 0, there exists a number o such that
I a -piq I> ol qN whatever in~ers p and q are chosen. E.g., if a is
a quadratic number such as v'2 , no rational plq will get close to a
within less than 2l3(cr- 4c0c2 ) 112q 2 .
This theorem was used by Liouville to construct the first
transcendental number, i.e., a number aL that is not the solution of an
algebraic equation with integer coefficients. Let aL have the continued
fraction with an = 1Qnf; then an + 1 = (an)n + I, and one shows easily
that qn < 2 10 11 + 21 + ··· + n! < 102 (n!) = a~; our estimate then shows
that I aL- Pnlqn I< 1lan + IQ; < 1l(qn)(n + S)/ 2 . If £tL were algebraic
of degree N, its 2N-th convergent would already beat Liouville's lower
limit.

132

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

Transcendental numbers that beat the Liouville conditions are
called Liouville numbers. Not all transcendental numbers are Liouville;
in fact, there is an ongoing competition between mathematicians to
'lower the boom' on transcendental numbers. The present record for
'TT is held by Gregory Choodnovsky (1979) who showed that
I 'TT- plql > 8lq7 . Algebraic numbers, too, are much less rational
than the Liouville conditions would suggest. Indeed, a difficult and
non-constructive argument by Roth shows that for an algebraic number
I a - pI q I > 8I q2 + ' with e positive and arbitrarily small, but not 0.
These modern results on irrational numbers are quite subtle; they require a large formal apparatus and serve as a warning against the
temptation to oversimplify the mathematics of soft chaos.

9.6 The KAM Theorem
The explanations of the first four sections of this chapter about the
effect of small perturbations on an integrable system can be made
mathematically precise. The necessary formal apparatus is formidable,
however, and the results are disappointing in the sense that the rigorous
limits on the relevant propositions are much more stringent than the
numerical examples indicate. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware
of the minimum that can be guaranteed by mathematical proofs, and
to be reassured that the somewhat superficial discussion of this chapter
has some validity.
The central KAM theorem and its proof were first suggested by
Kolmogoroff (1954), but the details were worked out by Arnold
(1963), and the same conclusions were then established under much
broader assumptions by Moser (1962). Benettin, Galgani, Giorgilli,
and Strelcyn (1984) have given a self-contained presentation of the
proof along Kolmogoroff's original scheme.
The main object is to overcome the small denominators which appeared in the discussion of canonical transformations of Section 5.3,
particularly in formula (5.8) and which cannot be avoided. One would
like to be sure that the second, non-trivial term in the generating
function (5.6) is small in spite of the denominator
wm = (m, w) = mowo + m1w1 + m2w2 + m3w3 where we abbreviate
m = (m 0 , m1, m 2 , m3 ). This condition requires that the corresponding
perturbation Vm become small with increasing I m I =
Imo I + I m1 I + I m2l + I m3 I at a faster rate than wm. Our main
discussion in this section will center on various ways in which this
condition can be realized.

9.6 The KAM Theorem

133

Satisfying this requirement is not the whole story, however, because
even if one particular canonical transformation as given in Section 5.3
succeeds in overcoming its small denominator, all the other terms of the
perturbation (3.5) have to be transformed before going on to the next
step. The next term to be treated in the new series (3.5) is characterized by the integers m', and the new coefficient Vm' may be quite different after the transformation compared with its value in the series
(3.5) before the transformation. If the old coefficient was small for its
associated frequency Wm', there is a priori no assurance that this will still
hold for the new coefficient.
Another difficulty comes from the modifications in H 0 at each step
in the perturbation procedure. The expressions (5.3) for the old
actions I; in terms of the new ones .J.i have to be inserted into
H 0 (11, h. h) and the result has to be expanded in powers of e. The
even powers contain terms, like the square of (5.7), that yield a correction to Ho because sin2 ( ... ) = 1/2 - cos 2( ... )12, of which the first
part adds to the new H 0 . The zero-order Hamiltonian for the next step,
H' oCJ1, J 2 , J3) differs, therefore, from HoUJ, h, h) by terms of order
e 2 • If the same values are assigned to J; as to 1;, the new frequencies
differ from the old ones; unforeseen resonances can arise.
An example is the near-resonance between the three main motions
of the Moon in the combination 2wnode + Wperigee - 3wsidereah which
was mentioned in Section 5.4. The expansion in powers of the small
parameter then' ln-::::.1113 has to be carried to the third power before
this resonance appears; in second order, one would believe that
Wnode + Wperigee = 0 as formulas (5.9) and (5.10) show to Newton's
great distress. Hill's theory of the Moon circumvents this problem by
obtaining the complete expansion in n' In before treating any of the
other small parameters.
The purpose of the KAM theorem is to demonstrate the continued
existence of certain invariant tori as the perturbation parameter e increases from 0. The frequencies wm are kept away from any resonance
by requiring that

I wm I = l(m, w) I > 8 I m 1- v = 8 (~ lm; )1- v

(9.13)

at each step, where 8 and v are independent of m. In a system with two
degrees of freedom, the results of the preceding section can be used to
insure this condition. If the frequency ratio a = wd w2 is irrational,
then Iqw 1 - pw2l = qw2l a - pIq I ¢ 0 as long as both w2 and q
differ from 0. Therefore, if I a- plq I> 8lqv + 1, condition (9.13)
holds. With more than two degrees of freedom, however, the question
of the preceeding section becomes how to approximate simultaneously
two or more ratios of frequencies, a, {3, etc. by rational numbers; the
beautiful theory of continued fractions is no longer available, and very

134

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

little is known. Nevertheless, condition (9.13) is the central assumption.
Two more ideas are important to complete the proof of the KAM
theorem. Instead of the stepwise expansion in powers of e where the
remainder is smaller than the last term by only one factor e, a construction is used where the remainder is of order e2k after the terms of
order ek have been treated. The elementary example of this superconvergence is found in Newton's method for solving equations such as
f(x) = 0; if x 0 is a first guess, the first approximation x 1 is obtained
from solving the linear equationf(xo)
(xo)(x - .xo) = 0; the second
approximation x 2 follows then from the linear equation
f(xt) + I (xi) (x - Xt) = 0, and so on. When solving for x2, it is no
longer admissible to calculate f(x 1 ) and I (x 1 ) by expanding in powers
of the small difference (x 1 - x 0 ) . Also, this 'superconvergence' is not
applied to the full perturbation, but only to a properly smoothed version, not unlike singling out a particular, slowly varying term in explaining the effects of a resonance. These sketchy indications are
intended to show that the KAM theorem cannot be proved without
techniques outside conventional perturbation theory.
The KAM theorem will now be quoted from Arnold's book (1978):

+I

If an undisturbed system is non-degenerate, then for sufficiently
small conservative Hamiltonian perturbations, most non-resonant invariant tori do not vanish, but are only slightly deformed, so that in
the phase space of the perturbed system, too, there are invariant tori
densely filled with phase curves winding around them conditionallyperiodically, with a number of independent frequencies equal to the
number of degrees of freedom. These invariant tori form the majority in the sense that the measure of the complement of their union
is small when the perturbation is small.

(A conditionally-periodic motion is the same as our multiperiodic motion in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.)
The resonant tori of the undisturbed system remove from phase
space a layer whose thickness in the space of the frequency ratios a is
essentially given by (9.9). The KAM theorem is made plausible if the
widths of these layers for all rational frequency ratios are added up, and
their sum is found to be finite; the strength e can then be chosen to
leave enough space for the frequencies which satisfy the criterion
( 9.13). If the perturbation is analytic as in the Kolmogoroff-Arnold
formulation, the expansion coefficients Vm in (3.5) decay exponentially
with Im I, and the sum over all vectors of integers m converges. If the
dynamical system has n degrees of freedom, and the perturbation is
only required to have IL continuous derivatives, as in Moser's version,

9.6 The KAM Theorem

the coefficients Vm decay as I m Jl - 2 . Since the width of the resoI terms for a
nance (9.9) goes With I Vm 11/2 , and there are ~ Im
I m I , convergence requires at the least that
given
(J.L +2)12- (n- 1) > 1, or J.L > 2n - 2. Moser gave the sufficient
condition J.L ~ 2n + 2; the reader will find more details of this type in
the monograph of Lichtenberg and Liebermann (1981).
A similar argument applies directly to the criterion ( 9.13): the frequencies wm which violate (9.13) for some fixed m fill a layer of
thickness 8I I m Iv + 1 in frequency space. Adding up all these excluded
. converges
layers leads to the sum of 8I I m Iv -n + 2 over 1m I, which
provided v > n - 1. In a system with two degrees of freedom, therefore, v > 1, which excludes all the quadratic numbers, and probably
most of the algebraic ones, too, according to Roth's result. In the most
common form, the KAM theorem is based on v = 312. While this kind
of argument yields reasonable inequalities for J.L and v, it deals only with
the frequencies whose neighborhood gets transformed into soft chaos.
By contrast, the KAM theorem insures the survival of the invariant
tori, and tells us something about the set in frequency space that is
complementary to the incipient chaos.

9. 7 Homoclinic Points
The destruction of the invariant tori can be seen as a catastrophe that
overtakes the dynamical system as it is subjected to an ever stronger
perturbation. A lot of effort, both numerical and analytical, has been
spent on trying to understand the detailed mechanism by which the
orderly structure of phase space gets lost, and to get a glimpse of what
happens after the disaster has occurred. The reader will have to work
through some of the vast literature to get an adequate picture of what
is known so far (cf. Arnold and Avez 1967; Devaney 1985;
Guckenheimer and Holmes 1983; as well as the survey by Grebogi,
Ott, and Yorke 1987). This and the next section will briefly mention
two ideas that seem to dominate much of this work.
The discusssion in Section 9.3 showed how the layered structure of
the nested tori (cf. Figure ltd) gets broken up so as to resemble the
phase space of a pendulum (cf. Figure 21). The immediate cause is a
resonance with a sufficiently strong perturbation; but no great harm is
done as long as this resonance stays isolated. The phase-lock region
looks like the vibrational motions of the pendulum, now represented
by a set of islands as in Figure 16; these are smoothly bounded by the
separatrix, beyond which the original layered structure again takes

136

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

over, just as the rotational motions of the pendulum; the critical element in this situation is the smooth nature of the separatrix.
A first general problem, therefore, concerns the loss of the
separatrix in one single chain of islands. The discussion of Sections 9. 3
and 9.4 gives no indication why the points P 1, P 2 , ... of unstable equilibrium between the islands should not remain the intersections of two
smooth torus-like surfaces, the two branches of the separatrix as it
were; the transition from Figure 23a to Figure 23b, however, indicates
something quite different.
The points P~o P 2 , ... continue to be part of a periodic orbit as the
perturbation increases; but the linear map in their neighborhood acquires a trace larger than 2. As a consequence, there are two welldefined directions through each of them: the stable one for the
trajectories approaching ever more closely at each pass through the
surface of section, and the unstable one for the trajectories getting
further and further away, as in the typical hyperbolic periodic orbit of
Figure llb.
For sufficiently weak perturbations, these two directions, say the
stable one at P 1 and the unstable one at P2 , are connected by the
separatrix so that a trajectory that starts near P 1 on the unstable manifold eventually ends up near P2 , typically after a very long time. As
the perturbation becomes strong enough, the stable as well as the unstable directions at P1, P2, ... continue to define smooth curves in the
surface of section, namely the intersections of the stable and the unstable manifolds with the surface of section. The existence of these
rather smooth manifolds, and their smooth lines of intersection, when
everything else in phase space seems to break down, is something of a
mathematical miracle. The trajectories on the stable manifold are
characterized by their tendency to approach ever more closely to P 1
or P2 at each pass in the future; trajectories on the unstable maniflold
approach in the same way when going backward in time. But the unstable line of P 1 does no longer join up smoothly with the stable line
of P 2 , or any other stable line in the surface of section, to form a
separatrix; and similarly for P 2 .
On the contrary, lines originating in different points Pi will intersect
transversally in a well-defined set of points. They are called heteroclinic
points, if the intersection occurs between the stable and unstable lines
belonging to different points Pi and P1 ; if the stable and unstable lines
come out of the same point corresponding to an unstable periodic orbit,
their intersections are called homoclinic points. The existence of these
points causes a profound reorganization in the neighborhood of the
unstable equilibria of the pendulum. Although this description refers

9.7 Homoclinic Points

137

only to one isolated chain of islands, it is the presenee of a neighboring
resonance which is responsible for the emerging chaos.
The conservation of area in the surface of section is now the main
culprit in making things so complicated, together with the fact that the
stable or the unstable lines cannot intersect themsellves. The relevant
arguments were first presented in detail by Birkhoff (1935); but already Poincare (1899, last chapter) had understood their full impact.
Since a serious discussion would take too much space, we will try to
give the reader at least a glimpse of classical chaos in the making due
to an homoclinic point; Figure 24 shows schematically how the stable
and unstable lines are bound to form very complicated folding patterns.
Let the stable line w out of the unstable periodic orbit through P,
intersect the unstable line a out of the same point P in the homoclinic
point Q 0 . The name a was chosen to remind the reader that the preimages of Qo in the surface of section, Q_ 1, Q-2· ... , lie on a, and form
a sequence of points converging toP in the past; similarly, the images
of Q0, called Q 1, Q 2, ... , lie on w where they form a sequence converging to P in the future. Thus, lines a and ffi keep intersecting each
other and forming new homoclinic points.
Between any two consecutive intersections, Q1 and Q1 + 1 , the segments along a and w define an open domain D1; all these domains enclose an area A which is the same, independent of j.
If
self-intersections of either a or ware to be avoided, these domains have
to take on increasingly contorted shapes. They become thinner and
longer, because one of the bounding segments gets short quickly with
large IJ I; e.g., for j < 0, the points Q1 lie on the initial portion of w
near P, and their distance obviously decreases exponentially.
Eventually, one of these domains doubles back on itself to the point
where both ends run right across one of its predecessors; the cut of the
boundaries is allowed only of a with w. The abstract version of this
situation is the famous horseshoe of Smale (1965); the original domain
D of roughly rectangular shape is stretched in one direction, and then
bent like a horseshoe big enough so that its two ends run across D. Part
of D is mapped into itself, and this map can be repeated indefinitely,
both forward and backward.
This process leads to a natural coding scheme in terms of binary
sequences, because there is a choice between the two branches of the
horseshoe at each step of the consecutive transformations of D. The
long-term behavior of the trajectories is now characterized by the
symbolic dynamics of the binary sequences; in particular, it is easy to
see that there are infinitely many new periodic orbits, as well as trajectories with a seemingly random character, according as the binary
sequence is periodic or random. The basic mechanism behind these

138

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

unexpectedly complicated features in a simple dynamical system is the
stretching and bending of an initially nice convex area in phase space,
in agreement with Liouville's theorem.
The simple device of letting the stable and unstable lines in the
surface of section intersect each other has produced the most extreme
chaos, something akin to the flipping of a coin. While this picture is
very generally valid, it does not yield the detailed and exhaustive information about the classical trajectories, in order to make the transition to quantum mechanics; the symbolic dynamics is applicable only
to a very tiny subset in the surface of section. In contrast, we will find
that all the trajectories in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem (Chapter
11), and the geodesics on a surface of negative curvature (Chapter 19),
can be fully understood in terms of a simple coding scheme.

9.8 The Lore of the Golden Mean
A second general problem concerns the fusion of different chains of
islands into a single region of chaotic character through the destruction
of the invariant tori between them. The reader will find a useful se-

lection of reprints in the book edited by MacKay and Meiss (198 7);
only a bare outline of some ideas will be given in this section.
As the perturbation in the Hamiltonian is allowed to increase, the
critical parameter on any invariant torus in the original system is the
winding number a. On a two-dimensional torus, it is the ratio between
the two frequencies; in more than two degrees of freedom, however,
more than one ratio is needed to characterize the way in which the
trajectory winds around its torus. As a rule, the less rational a, the
more resistant the torus; the last invariant torus to be destroyed by the
perturbation has the most irrational frequency ratios.
If a is expanded in a continued fraction (9.10), and the values of
an remain small, the difference between successive convergents,
1I qnqn + 1 = 11qn(an + 1qn + qn _ t) remains large, and neither convergent ever gets close to a. The worst case is obviously an = 1 for all
n; the recursion formulas then yield Pn =In_ t. qn ==ln. where In is the
n-th Fibonacci number: 1- 1 = 0, lo = 1, It = 1 .fn + 1 =In +In - 1;
and a =
1)12 = y, the famous golden ratio y of Greek geometry. Therefore, the last invariant torus to disappear as the perturbation increases is expected to have the winding number y. A useful
collection of various articles concerning this phenomenon has been put
together by Cvitanovic (1984).
Even though more and more island chains are created, the remaining tori set up barriers which prevent the trajectories from drifting
indiscriminately all over phase space. This conclusion holds rigorously
for conservative systems with two degrees of freedom, because the
two-dimensional tori effectively separate the three-dimensional energy
surface into distinct open sets. With three degrees of freedom, however, a three-dimensional torus does not divide the five-dimensional
energy surface into two disconnected open pieces; a trajectory that
originates near one resonance eventually drifts toward some other resonance although there still exists an invariant torus at an intermediate
set of winding numbers. This process, called Arnold diffusion (Arnold
1964) is actually very slow; it has been found to take a time
~ exp( - 1I e 0 ) with a~ 112, while the diffusion of the trajectory inside
its own original island chain takes a time ~ 1I e'~" with T > 0; e is the
strength of the perturbation (cf. Chirikov 1979). This further complication of the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is still
largely unexplored (cf. Piro and Feingold 1988), and we shall, therefore, return to the safety of systems with no more than two degrees of
freedom.
The most closely studied systems are area-conserving maps, and
among them in particular the so-called standard map,
ln +I)= ln) + K sin w(n), w(n +I)= w(n) + ln +I). (9.14)

Soft Chaos and the KAM Theorem

The corresponding physical model, the kicked rotator, is a pendulum
of length a and mass m, or equivalently, a rotator with moment of inertia ma 2 which is kicked with an impulse F l:!:.t sin w at equal time intervals, l:!:.t apart; w is the angular position at the time of the impulse;
the motion is a uniform rotation between kicks. If one normalizes the
angular momentum J by setting I= Jl:!:.t/ma 2 , and calls K =
F(tlt) 2 /ma, the first equation (9.14) gives the increase in angular momentum from the n-th kick, and the second equation describes the increase of the angular position between the n-th and the (n + 1)-th kick.
The conservation of area can be checked by calculating the Jacobian
au<n + 1)' w<n + 1))/ ()(I(n)' w(n)) = 1.
The ordinary pendulum arises in the limit l:!:.t -+ 0 which corresponds
to K-+ 0. The difference equations (9.14) become two ordinary
first-order
differential
equations
with
the
Hamiltonian
H 0 = (J2 /2ma 2 ) + F cos w. Near the stable equilibrium at w = 'IT the
frequency of the motion is F I ma 2 ; the separatrix including the unstable e uil"brium at w = 0 is given by H 0 = F, where
I= ± 2 ma 2F sin(w/2), and the period is infinite. As tlt increases
from 0, the trajectories tend to get stuck and form chains of islands
around the periodic orbits of the difference equations (9.14); but for
small K they are separated by what remains of the curves H0 = const.,
where the winding number a is irrational.
These are the KAM tori, so called because they are guaranteed to
exist by the KAM theorem; they set up barriers for the classical trajectories, whose presence is critical for the understanding of chaos.
For their practical calculation, the periodic orbits have to be found at
a fixed K for a sequence of rational winding numbers that are the convergents for a given irrational number such as y. As long as the corresponding KAM torus still exists, the trace for the local map near the
periodic orbit will become 2 for the higher convergents. Greene
(1979) calculated the residue (cf. section 6.4) for the relevant sequence of periodic orbits, and found their asymptotic behavior as a
function of their order in the continued fraction expansion. He showed
that the last KAM-torus for the standard map (9.14) belongs to the
golden mean y, and disappears when K > .9716, as shown in Figure
25.
According to Escande and Doveil (1981), however, it is not necessarily the winding number y which determines the last KAM torus (cf.
the review by Escande 1985). Nevertheless, the standard map gives a
particularly simple example where the transition to global chaos in the
phase space can be studied, even after K has become larger than its
critical value. As a rule, the region of the last KAM torus acts as a
barrier, on which the trajectories get stuck for a while even then, al-

though they will eventually traverse it. It appears that this delay near
a former KAM torus is crucial in quantum mechanics; a wave function
is able to maintain itself in such a region, almost as if there was still a
good invariant torus to settle on. Reinhardt (1985) has coined the
phrase of 'vague' or 'fragmented' torus for this situation in classical
phase space.

CHAPTER 10

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

The throw of a dice and the flip of a coin are the best-known devices
for generating an unpredictable end result. In both cases the detailed
sequence of events cannot be controlled at each step so as to guarantee
a definite outcome. The main problem seems to lie with the starting
conditions although relatively few parameters are involved: the position and the momentum of the center of mass, as well as the orientation
in space and the angular momentum at a given instant in time. These
quantities would have to be measured with an accuracy far exceeding
any practical instrument; moreover, the drag from the air and the
bouncing from surfaces would have to be investigated to a degree that
is not ordinarily available. Nevertheless, there is a chain of cause and
effect from beginning to end; nothing is inherently random in the elementary mechanics, but our ignorance makes it so.
Physicists have been aware of this paradoxical situation ever since
Maxwell and Boltzmann laid the foundations of statistical mechanics
at the end of the nineteenth century. But the resolution of the paradox
depended on the large number of degrees of freedom, which obviates
any effort to take into account the motions of all the particles involved.
The mathematicians realized that similar problems of predictability
arise in much simpler systems where the equations of motion can be
written without much trouble and can be solved numerically on a (by
modern standards) primitive computer. A number of very useful concepts were developed to define different types of such behavior; the
most important notion is called entropy. This name was adopted from
thermodynamics where it designates a measurable quantity that, ac-

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

143

cording to Boltzmann's interpretation, indicates the prevailing degree
of disorder.
While the idea of an entropy is of great help in understanding classical mechanical systems, nobody has been able to find its analog in
quantum mechanics; therein lies the great unresolved mystery of
quantum chaos. This chapter gives a brief introduction to the concept
of entropy in classical mechanics, and some related notions, to make it
quite clear that there is nothing imprecise about these quantities. For
a rigorous and complete presentation, however, the reader will have to
consult the mathematical literature; a particularly fine introduction is
the book by Arnold and Avez (1967).

10.1 Abstract Dynamical Systems
In order to be on firm ground, the objects of investigation are defined
in terms that are somewhat remote from physics. A classical dynamical
system, also called a flow, is a collection of objects (M, p., cp1) where M
is a differentiable manifold, alias a phase space, JL is a density defined
on M, alias Liouville measure, and cp 1 is a one-real-parameter group of
diffeomorphisms (continuously differentiable map) of M into itself
that preserves the measure based on p., alias equations of motion. The
restriction to a group rather than an arbitrary one-parameter family
makes each time interval 8t equivalent to any other of the same duration; that is exactly what happens in a conservative Hamiltonian system.
A particularly popular example is the geodesic flow on a Riemannian
surface N; the manifold M is a set of points where each is the combination of a point inN and a tangent direction there; the measure JL is
the product of the area (volume) of Nand the (solid) angle of directions; the flow cp 1 describes the motion of a particle that moves
freely on N with unit speed for a time t.
As a purely mathematical model, one may instead study an abstract
dynamical system: again a collection of objects (M, p., cp1) where now
M is a measurable space with a measure JL and a group of
automorphisms cp 1 (maps of Minto itself) that preserve the measure JL
and where the variable t runs through the integers. In contrast to the
preceding definition, the space M is only required to be endowed with
a measure, and the automorphisms do no more than preserve this
measure, so that sets of measure zero are allowed to do whatever they
please. The maps on Poincare sections belong to this kind of dynamical

144

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

system, since the parameter for them is discrete; but there are now
examples which seem at first far removed from ordinary mechanics.
The standard example is the Bernoulli scheme B(p 1, ... , Pm): Consider an alphabet of m letters which will be called (1, ... , m) for simplicity's sake; a point a in the space M is a sequence
a=( ... , a_ 1, a0 , a 1, a2 , ... ) where a;= 1, ... , m. In order to define a
measure in this space, the sets AiJ = [a Ia; = j} are given the measure
Pi > 0 with 2.p1 = 1. The sets AiJ generate a so-called a-algebra of
measurable sets in M by taking all the possible intersections and unions
with the obvious rules for the measure, such as !L(A;J n Ak, f) = PJ pp
provided i =fi k.
The group of automorphisms is defined as the integer powers of the
shift, cf> : a -+ a' where a'; = a; + 1 which translates the whole sequence
a to the left by one place. In order to give a physical interpretation to
the shift, we call the half-sequence ap = (... , a_z, a_ 1 , a0 I the past,
and the half-sequence a1 = I a 1 , az ,... ) the future. After the event
a 1 has occurred, the past becomes a'p = (... , a_ 1 , a0 , a 1 I, and the
future is a'r = Iaz , a3 , ... ).
The simplest among the Bernoulli schemes, B(1/2, 1/2), is nothing
but the coin toss: the experience of a particular person in this game is
described by a binary sequence a of letters in the alphabet

quences is the same as the measure of the subset in the space M that
is made up of these sequences. Notice that no concept of closeness
between the points a is required, only a notion of measure. Binary sequences will occur again in the discussion of the Anisotropic Kepler
Problem (cf. next chapter); but they will be represented as points in a
plane, and acquire thereby a notion of distance between different sequences, which is absent in a Bernoulli scheme.
A more involved example of an abstract dynamical system is the
subshift where the space M consists again of the infinite sequences a
of letters from a finite alphabet, and an automophism is obtained from
the translation of a sequence by one place; but the measure IL on M is
generated by the sets A;,J, k = [a Ia; = j, a;+ 1 = k] whose measure is
given by a matrix of transition probabilities p1k ~ 0 with the normalization 2. Pik = 1 where, for each value of j, the sum is taken over k.
Such a scheme has a memory built in, since the probability of the future
event a 1 depends on the past event a0 . This is the basic model for a
Markoff process. It is realized in the geodesic flow on a compact closed
surface of constant negative curvature that will be discussed briefly in
Section 20.3.

10.1 Abstract Dynamical Systems

145

The Bernoulli schemes are the most unpredictable, and yet
deterministic processes imaginable. The word deterministic conveys the
basic assumption of classical mechanics: if the initial point a in the
space M is known with infinite precision, then the 'trajectory'

a', a", ... can be calculated for all later times, and even for all earlier

times as well.
A mechanical system can be classified as being 'Bernoulli' although
it may not look like that at all. Quite generally, two systems (M, f.J., cp)
and (M', f.1. 1 , cp 1 ) are called isomorphic if there exists a measurepreserving bijection f : M - M' (one-to-one map) modulo sets of
measure 0 where cp 1 (f(M)) =f(cp(M)), i.e., the order offand cp does
not matter, always up to sets of measure 0.
The two Bernoulli schemes B(l/2, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8) and
B(l I 4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4) are isomorphic; the reader may try to imagine
how the bijection f can be established and will find it very difficult. Its
existence depends on the equality of the entropies of the two schemes
as will be discussed in Section 10.3.
Besides the isomorphism between two particular dynamical systems
it is of interest to know whether a system is typical. The answer requires a concept of closeness (topology) between systems whereby
each system is surrounded by a neighborhood of other systems, and the
problem is to find the generic properties that are valid for a whole
neighborhood even if the systems in it are not equivalent. Abstract
dynamical systems have a better chance to be generic than the classical
dynamical systems, which are described under more restrictive assumptions. In particular, since Hamiltonian systems, which are the
topic of this book (and the basis of physics), have very few generic
features, there is a tremendous variety of truly dissimilar types.

10.2 Ergodicity, Mixing, and K-Systems
The mathematicians have developed a finely tuned hierarchy of possible behavior in dynamical systems. We will mention the three most
commonly used, and define them only with the degree of precision
necessary to convey their basic differences.
(i) Ergodicity: For each integrable function f: M - R, the spatial
mean ff df.l. equals the temporal mean (1/T)JJ" f(cp 1 x) dt when T- oo,
and where x is any point in M with the exception of a set of measure
0. The integral over t is replaced by a sum when the parameter t varies
in discrete steps. This definition corresponds to the original idea that
Boltzmann invoked to explain the second law of thermodynamics. It

146

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

turns out to be widely realized in dynamical systems; but it is not nearly
strong enough to guarantee what Boltzmann intended to accomplish
with it.
The repeated rotations around a point by an irrational angle are
ergodic; this is the famous theorem that Weyl proved for the first time,
although it must seem obvious to most non-mathematicians. The space
M is the circumference of the unit-circle, the measure p. is the length
along the circumference, and the automorphism is the rotation by the
angle 2'1Tcx where 0 <ex< 1. Pandey, Bohigas and Giannoni (1989)
have shown that this system has some very non-random features which
make it unsuitable as a model in statistical mechanics; the angular distances between the points on the circle take values that are severely
restricted rather than being arbitrary.
Ergodicity implies that the phase space M cannot be decomposed
into subsets with non-vanishing measure each of which remains invariant. This idea is presented in many textbooks as the ergodic hypothesis
which underlies thermodynamics. And yet, no explicit model for the
basic phenomenon of heat conduction was known until Casati, Ford,
Vivaldi and Visscher ( 1984) gave a very appealing demonstration: a
few particles move inside a segment of finite length; when they reach
the left end, they are reinjected with a kinetic energy corresponding to
the lower temperature T1, whereas they reappear with the higher temperature T2 upon reaching the right end of the interval. During their
travel back and forth, these particles hit massses that are suspended
from a point like a pendulum and deprive the particles of their energy.
When the pendulum comes back to its original position, the particle
gets its energy back and can continue its trip down the segment; but the
waiting time is longer for the higher kinetic energy, and this retardation
of the fast particles accounts for an orderly transfer of energy at a finite
rate that is proportional to the temperature difference as in Fourier's
law.
(ii) Mixing: Given two subsets A and B of M, as t -+ oo one has
p.(<f>,(AnB)) = p.(A) p.(B); each subset eventually gets spread out
homogeneously. The rotations by an irrational angle do not satisfy this
condition; two overlapping intervals of the circle remain exactly as they
were at the start. On the other hand, it takes only relatively little stirring to mix coffee and milk quite thoroughly.
Neither ergodicity nor mixing gives us any understanding of a peculiar paradox in chaotic systems: on the one hand, they seem to obliterate any simple pattern that a trajectory might be designed to
follow; on the other, they are full of the most rigid of such repetitive
behavior, i.e., periodic orbits for isolated starting conditions. Indeed,
the rotations by a fixed irrational angle 2'1Tcx yield no periodic orbits

10.2 Ergodicity, Mixing, and K-Systems

147

whatsoever, although they are ergodic. The paradox appears when the
scrambling of the space M proceeds in a much more pervasive manner,
which was first studied by Kolmogorov.
Before giving the relevant definition, however, a number of technical terms have to be defined. A collection E of subsets in M is called
an algebra, if it is closed under the operations of taking the union for a
denumerable family of subsets and of taking the complement of a subset (and, therefore, of taking the intersection between subsets). An
algebra Eo is said to be contained in the algebra E t. if for every subset
Ao e: Eo
there
exists
a
subset
A 1 e: E 1
such
that
p.(Ao U A 1 - A 0 () A 1) = 0, i.e., up to sets of measure 0 the algebra E 1
divides up the space M at least as well as the algebra E 0 . If a number
of algebras E; are available, then there exists a maximal algebra () E;
which is contained in all of them, and a minimal algebra U E; which
contains them all. If the map cp is applied to the subsets of an algebra
E, the images of all the subsets of E generate another algebra with the
obvious name cp(E).
(iii) K-system: there exists an algebra E of measurable subsets in
M which is contained in the algebra q,(E) in such a way that
() q,n(E) = n and U q,n(E) = '1', both taken over all integers n; the algebra n contains only sets of measure 0 or 1, whereas the algebra '1'
contains all the measurable subsets of M. Similar definitions apply to
the classical dynamical systems where the parameter t is continuous.
The prime example of this construction are the Bernoulli schemes.
The algebra E is generated by the subsets A;J with i > 0. Since
cp(A;,j) =A;_ l,j , this algebra is further subdivided with each subsequent map cp. Every measurable subset with non-vanishing measure is
caught eventually, with the possible exception of subsets with measure
0, or the whole space, because the complements always belong to an
algebra.

10.3 The Metric Entropy
The concept of entropy in a dynamical system was formalized by
Kolmogorov on the basis of the definition that Boltzmann had originally used in his theory of gases. Similar expressions are found
throughout statistical mechanics and have become the essence of information theory. Again, an awesome degree of mathematical abstraction seems unavoidable, and we can only give a (possibly bitter)
taste of the necessary details.

148

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

The space M has to be subdivided by a decomposition a, which is a
collection of measurable subsets Ai where the index i now belongs to a
collection I ; the union of these subsets is M, and all their intersections
are void, up to sets of measure 0. The entropy h(a) with respect to the
decomposition a is defined as
h(a)

= - L JL(A)Log(JL(A)) ,

(10.1)

i E I

where Log designates the logarithm with the base 2.
The next step in the construction requires the joining of two decompositions a and f3 in a straightforward manner: a decomposition
y = a u f3 consists of all the intersections of a subset Ai E a with a
subset Bk E /3. Now, the entropy h(a, cp) of the automorphism cp with
respect to the decomposition a becomes the limit
h(a, cp)

= n-oc
lim _!_ h(a u cp -l(a) U cp - 2(a) U · ·· U cp 1 - n(a)) 00.2)
n

A lot of hard work goes into showing that this limit exists.
The last step consists in getting rid of the reference to the decomposition a by looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) when
all finite and measurable decompositions of a of M are considered.
Thus, one finds the metric entropy of the automorphism cp
h(cp) =supremum h(a, cp) .
(10.3)
finite a

More hard labor is required; but eventually the goal is reached in the
form of two theorems.
The entropy h( cp) is an invariant of the automorphism in the sense that
two isomorphic automorphisms cp and cp 1 have the same metric entropy.
As an example, the two Bernoulli schemes at the end of Section 10.1
have the same value of the metric entropy because they are isomorphic;
the equality of the entropies will be obvious as soon as the entropy for
Bernoulli schemes is actually calculated in the next paragraph. Meanwhile another theorem is needed to allow us to make this calculation
possible. It is natural to use a finite decomposition a to generate the
algebra:=: which goes into the definition of a K-system at the end of the
preceding section, by joining a with cp- 1(a) , cp- 2 (a), and so on. If this
can be done, a is called a generator with respect of cp. If a is a generator
for the automorphism cp, the metric entropy h(cp) = h(a, cp). In other
words, it is no longer necessary to find the least upper bound for all
possible finite and measurable decompositions of M.
The generating decomposition a for the Bernoulli scheme
B(p 1, ••• ,pm) is obtained from the setsA 11, ... ,A 1m as defined in Section 10.1. Since cp -k(A 1) = Ak + 1 J• the subsets of the decomposition

and
B(l/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4) have the same value 2 Log 2 = 2, whereas the
coin-toss B( 1/2, 1/2) has the entropy Log 2 = 1. Intuitively the
scrambling of the space M is twice as effective at each step when the
entropy is twice; that coincides with our impression of the two former
Bernoulli schemes being equivalent to a double coin-toss.
Ornstein proved the remarkable theorem: All Bernoulli schemes
with the same entropy (10.4) are isomorphic. This proposition is a model
of simplicity; but its proof is very hard. It requires the construction of
the isomorphism/, which is extremely difficult to find because it cannot
be defined in a finite process. The development of this field, including
some of the work to be discussed in the next sections, was recently reviewed by Adler (1987).
A favorite model of a strongly ergodic system is a point particle on
a flat torus with a circular hole; the particle moves with constant velocity in a straight line until it hits the hole, where it undergoes an
elastic reflection, maintaining its momentum parallel to the boundary,
and reversing the momentum at right angles to the boundary. The
motion gets badly defocused in this kind of billiard game, and Sinai
(1968, 1970) has shown that this system has a non-vanishing entropy.
A related model is the motion inside a stadium, i.e., two half-circles
joined by two parallel lines; although its ergodic properties are not so
obvious, Bunimovich (197 4, 1979) was able to show that there is again
a non-vanishing metric entropy (cf. Bunimovich and Sinai 1980). A
recent update of these mathematically oriented developments was
given by Katok and Strelcyn (1986).

10.4 The Automorphisms of the Torus
Since mechanics is closer to geometry than to algebra, one would like
to have an example where the scrambling of phase space can be seen
more intuitively. The automorphisms of the torus fulfill this role; they

150

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

also show the relation between the metric entropy of the preceding
section and the topological entropy of the next section.
Let L be an m by m matrix with integer elements such that det
I L I = 1. The space M is the m-dimensional hypercube with opposite
sides identified just like the m-dimensional torus of the angle variables
in Section 3.3. Its points are given by the column vectors x with the
components (x 1, ... , Xm) where 0 ~ x; < 1. The measure is the
Euclidean volume, which is preserved because det I L I = 1. The
automorphism cp transforms x into the column vector y with the linear
transformation
y = Lx (modulo 1) .
(10.5)
The most famous example is Arnold's cat map with the 2 by 2 matrix
( 1, 1; 1, 2) in flattened notation. The pictures of the gradual distortion
and disruption of a eat's head have become a compulsory item in every
book on chaos.
The effect of the automorphism (10.5) on them-dimensional cube
can be understood by transforming the matrix L into diagonal form
with real entries. This can be done for the cat map since Lis symmetric; in general, however, the discussion is more complicated. The local
neighborhoods get stretched in the direction where the eigenvalues A
of L are > 1, and get compressed in the directions where I A I < 1.
This argument has to be made more explicit in order to calculate the
metric entropy; but the general result is again very simple:
h(L)

=

L Log IAI .

(10.6)

I AI > I

This formula relates the metric entropy to the local distortion of the
space M; or equivalently, if one thinks of neighboring points as getting
progressively further and further away from each other, the metric
entropy gives the rate at which the two points diverge.
This last interpretation of the metric entropy is very important for
the later applications. Quite generally, any two neighboring initial
points can be followed through many successive automorphisms; their
distance increases in an exponential manner with the number of
automorphisms. The rate of this exponential drift follows from the
linearized map and its eigenvalues exactly as for L; the expression on
the right-hand side of (10.6) is called the Lyapounoff number for the
automorphism in some particular neighborhood. Quite generally, the
metric entropy is given by the average over the Lyapounoff numbers,
h(cp)

= <

L Log I AI > .

lA I> I

10.4 The Automorphisms of the Torus

151

The exponential spreading of the trajectories was already mentioned
in Section 1.6.
The linear automorphism shows very clearly the occurrence of periodic orbits. For this purpose, let us study the n-th power A = Ln of
the matrix L. A point x in the torus which returns to itself after n
automorphisms satisfies the equation Ax= x modulo 1, or more explicitly, Ax= x + k where k is a column vector with m integer components. This condition can be written as (A - I )x = k, or in the form
x =(A- I )- 1k, where I is the m-dimensional unit matrix. The
transformation from the vector k to the vector x reduces the unit volume by a factor K = det I A - I I. Therefore, if the vector k runs over
the integer lattice points in m-dimensional space covering a volume
equal to K, the corresponding points x are all located inside the m-dimensional unit cube.
The condition for a point x on the torus to have the period n is satisfied exactly K times. The integer

in the limit of large n. If Nn(L) designates the number of periodic orbits
of 'length' n for the automorphism L, then in the limit of large n
+Log Nn(L) ~

L Log IA I = h(L) ,

(10.8)

lt..l >I

where the formula (10.6) for the metric entropy of L has been used.
The metric entropy appears in a completely different context; the degree of scrambling that the automorphism L wreaks on the torus is expressed in the number of points that are mapped into themselves as the
map is iterated. The arithmetical properties of linear maps on the
2-torus have been studied by Vivaldi (1987) and by Percival and
Vivaldi (1987).

10.5 The Topological Entropy
The metric entropy tells us how fast the phase space M gets divided up
by the repeated automorphisms cf>. If the decomposition a consists of
v pieces, the decomposition a u cp- 1(a) u .. · u cp-n + l(a) can be expected to consist of vn pieces. The situation is more involved, however,
because if one starts with a decomposition a of too many pieces, applying the automorphism cp -I does not divide up every piece over and
over again. On the other hand, if the starting decomposition has too

152

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

few pieces, the repeated application of cp- 1 does not keep pace with the
scrambling of phase space.
Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew ( 1965) asked whether there is a
minimum number v for the generating decomposition a to calculate the
metric entropy. In order to get away from the metric entropy, and define a new and independent quantity for the disorder that is created in
the phase space by the automorphism cp, they went back to the original
idea of the K-systems as explained in Section 10.2. They tried to count
the number of subsets in the decomposition a and its offspring
n

U cp-i(a) as n increases, assuming that the algebra :=: of all measurable
subsets for a K-system will be obtained in the limit of large n.
Instead of measuring the decreasing size of the pieces, their increasing number gives the same information, possibly even on a more
fundamental level. This procedure can be viewed as setting up windows in the phase space M through which the trajectories have to pass;
a trajectory can be characterized by the sequence of windows it passes
as it is brought back by the succession of automorphisms. If the number of windows is too small, different trajectories end up with the same
sequence of windows; whereas for too large a number of windows,
some possible sequences of windows are not realized by any trajectory.
This idea of associating with every trajectory a sequence of subsets by
which it is characterized is reminiscent of the sequence of symbols that
is the base for Bernoulli schemes, or symbolic dynamics in general.
Going back to the decompositions a and calling N the number of
subsets, the topological entropy is defined as the infimum (largest lower
bound) with respect to all decompositions a of the quantity
g(cp)

= nlim
.....

oc

_!_LogN(a u cp-\a) u ... u cp 1 -n(a)) .(10.9)
n

In this form the topological entropy seems quite remote because it
seems difficult to count the different subsets, unless they are as simply
constituted as in the Bernoulli schemes; indeed, there are mn possible
words of length n in an alphabet of m letters, so that g = Log m. In
general, however, as a decomposition a is progressively cut into finer
pieces by the successive automorphisms cp -l, some cuts may not create
new subsets because they duplicate earlier cuts. Another way of doing
the same count may be, therefore, if not easier, then at least better
defined.
The relevant idea appears to be discussed for the first time in a paper of Bowen; the connection with formula (10.9) can be grasped intuitively, but the mathematical intricacies are again discouraging for a
physicist. As the decomposition a is refined by the automorphisms
cp - 1 , each piece can be characterized by a unique trajectory that re-

10.5 The Topological Entropy

153

turns to its beginning after n successive maps; in other words, by a periodic orbit. The number N in (10.9) is, therefore, also the number of
periodic orbits of length n; the topological entropy, rather than giving the
number of subsets in a generating decomposition, counts the number of

periodic orbits.

More generally, let us assume that there is a lengths defined for the
periodic orbits of a dynamical system; for a discrete automorphism , this
may simply be the number of transformatio ns to get back to the initial
point; but for a Hamiltonian system, the length is either the period, or
the action integral. The number of periodic orbits of length less than
a is then given by
N(s < a) ~ exp( aT log2) ,
(10.10)

where Tis the topological entropy. This exponential is typical for chaotic systems, and is in sharp contrast with the count of periodic orbits
in integrable systems, which was shown in Section 6.2 to be polynomial
in the upper limit a.
The number of periodic orbits for the linear automorphisms of the
torus was worked out in the preceding section; indeed, formula (10.8)
gives the topological entropy in this special case. The equality of the
topological entropy with the metric entropy can be proven for certain
classes of dynamical systems; the relevant statement is sometimes referred to as Pesin's theorem (cf. Pesin 1977). It does not hold for some
scattering problems where the trajectories are more unstable than their
increasing number would suggest, if the two entropie:s were the same.
The two different interpretation s of the entropy, metric and
topological, will be very important in the transition from classical to
quantum mechanics in chaotic systems. This transition can be understood if some quantity of interest in quantum mechanics, such as the
response to a external stimulus, or the probability for being deflected
in a scattering experiment, can be expressed as a sum over all relevant
classical trajectories. The convergence of this sum and the location of
its singularities as a function of the energy E are the result of the competition between the number of terms and their absolute magnitude,
i.e., between the kinds of entropy
A third element enters, however, in the guise of a phase factor
(complex number of absolute value 1), where the phase angle is the
classical action divided by Planck's quantum fz, either R from Chapter
1 or S from Chapter 2. The interplay among these three ingredients
was discussed by the author (Gutzwiller 1986a). The statistical properties of the phases, R/fz or S/fz, are sufficiently important that one is
tempted to speak of third entropy.

Entropy and Other Measures of Chaos

10.6 Anosov Systems and Hard Chaos
Dynamical systems can be further analyzed than has been done so far,
if the phase space M is endowed with a distance, indicated by the
double bars I II, in addition to the measure JL. Moreover, most applications of this new feature are made in spaces where functions can be
differentiated, and the automorphisms are differentiable, so that one
can speak of a tangent at a point, and so on. A Riemannian manifold
is the most important example of such a space, and the reader might
just as well fix her ideas on this case in the discussion of this section.
The definitions can easily be extended from the discrete maps cf> to the
continuous flows cp 1 • The map cf> : M- M is extended to the linear map
cp• : TMq-TMq where TMq is the tangent space of M at the point
q EM.
The Anosov systems satisfy the following conditions: The tangent
space at each point can be decomposed TMq = Xq® Yq so that for any
positive integer n, there are constants a, b, A that are independent of n
and the lengths I ~ I , 1111 I of the tangent vectors ~ and 7], so that
I (cp nr ~ II ~ aenA ~ ~ I ' I (cp -nr H ~ be -nA II H ' if ~ E xq ; (1 0 11)
ll(cpnf1J II ~ be-n 1111 I , I (cp -nr1J I ~ aen;\ 1111 I , if 1J E ~.
•
Xq is called the expanding linear subspace of TMq, and Yq is called the
contracting linear subspace. Locally, the Anosov system looks like a
linear automorphism of the torus.
If these conditions are applied to a flow cf>r , the tangent space TMq
decays into three linear subspaces, TMq = Xq® Yq®Zq, where Zq is
along the direction of the flow. A vector t E Zq stays constant in
length, whereas the vectors ~ E Xq grow exponentially with t, and the
vectors 1J E Yq decay exponentially with t. The dimensions of Xq and
of Yq are at least 1, whereas the dimension of Zq is always 1. The prime
example of these Anosov systems are the geodesic flows on surfaces of
negative curvature which are discussed in a monograph by Anosov
(1969), and will be the topic of Chapter 19.
The expanding and contracting subspaces in the tangent space of
each point can be tied together into smooth submanifolds of the phase
space M, called the unstable (expanding) and the stable (contracting)
submanifolds. The phase space carries two families of, roughly speaking, parallel leaves where each leaf in one family is transverse to the
leaves of the other family, i.e., intersects each leaf in a point (discrete
automorphisms) or in a line (continuous automorphisms). Each family

10.6 Anosov Systems and Hard Chaos

155

of submanifolds is said to foliate the manifold M, i.e., decompose it
completely into a family of non-intersecting, smooth submanifolds. A
trajectory can be viewed as the intersection of two leaves, one from
each family; neighboring trajectories approach exponentially along the
stable submanifold, and diverge exponentially along the unstable submanifold.
This structure of phase space is as clean and simple as the foliation
into invariant tori for integrable systems. The dimension of the leaves
equals the number of degrees of freedom in both situations; but the
function of the foliations is entirely different. The trajectories in
integrable systems stay on one leaf, and only one family of leaves is
necessary, whereas in Anosov systems each trajectory belongs to one
leaf from each family and is defined by the intersection of those two
leaves. The latter construction allows for a lot of possibilities, whereas
very few different designs are compatible with a single family of invariant tori. The double foliation of the Anosov systems is stable
against small perturbations, whereas the invariant tori are easy victims
of the small denominators as described in the KAM theorem.
Anosov systems and dynamical systems of a similar nature, such as
the Axiom-A systems of Smale (1967), have received wide attention in
the mathematical literature. They are in some vague sense the opposite
extreme to the integrable systems, because they are almost equivalent
to Bernoulli schemes, and represent, therefore, something that looks
totally random, although it remains deterministic. It seems as important to understand what they are doing as it is to study the integrable
systems; unfortunately, the physicists have grown up to believe in the
virtues of being integrable. A main motive for writing this book is to
wean them away from the misguided attachment to that rather exceptional set of circumstances.
The great bulk of dynamical systems looks like an intimate mixture
of the two extremes; the left-over KAM tori separate regions where
stable and unstable submanifolds govern the behavior of the trajectories. This simplified picture still needs to be substantiated by looking
at many examples more closely than has been done so far. We called
such a fusion of opposite behavior soft chaos in the last chapter, in
contrast to the extreme situation which was described in this section,
and which will be called hard chaos from now on.

CHAPTER 11

The Anisotropic Kepler Problem

The physically most appealing example of a conservative Hamiltonian
system with hard chaos is the analog of the hydrogen atom inside a
crystal of silicon or germanium. The significant difference with the
ordinary Kepler problem is the anisotropy of the mass tensor, i.e., the
electron moving in the crystal has a much larger inertia along one axis
than along the two other axes. Although the trajectories cannot be
written in terms of simple functions, the Poincare surface of section
has a simple structure very close to an Anosov system. The energy
surface foliates into two families of smooth submanifolds, the stable
and unstable ones. All the trajectories can be coded uniquely with the
help of binary sequences, and in particular, all the periodic orbits can
be effectively enumerated.

11.1 The Donor Impurity in a Semiconductor Crystal

Since solid-state physics is not a prerequisite for studying chaos, the
experimental origin of the Anisotropic Kepler Problem (AKP) will be
briefly explained in this section. Further details, especially concerning
the band structure of solids, have to be gleaned from any of the standard textbooks (cf. Kittel1966, p.316; Burns 1985, p.312).
The elements carbon, silicon, and germanium are chemically fourvalent; they arrange themselves naturally in the beautiful diamond
lattice where each atom sits at the center of tetrahedron with exactly

11.1 The Donor Impurity in a Semiconductor Crystal

157

four neighbors at the vertices. These crystals are insulators, unless
some of the atoms are replaced by their five-valent neighbors in
Mendeleev's table of elements, such as phosphorus, arsenic, antimony,
or bismuth. Each of these impurities carries effectively one more positive charge in its nucleus and brings one more electron with it so as to
maintain electric neutrality.
The extra electron is weakly bound to its parent atom and is easily
liberated from its bound state to roam freely through the crystal. The
silicon or germanium then becomes a semiconductor, i.e., not as good
an electric conductor as a metal, with the help of the electrons 'donated' by the five-valent impurities, thus their name of donor impurities.
Our problem is to understand the bound states of the extra electron,
but that requires a more precise idea of the way the isolated donor impurity and its additional electron can be accommodated in the crystal
lattice.
The additional nuclear charge in the donor impurity generates an
electric field which deforms (polarizes) the regular atoms in its neighborhood. The extra electron feels the combined effect of the nuclear
charge and the polarization of the surrounding lattice. The resulting
net force is still attractive, and decreases with the inverse square of the
distance; but it is weakened by a factor K, the dielectric constant of the
lattice, whose value is 11.4 in Si and 15.4 in Ge. The potential energy
of the electron is, therefore, given by - e2 I
+ +
The unusual feature of the AKP comes from its kinetic energy; a
few explanatory words have to suffice. Since the chemical bonds between the immediate neighbors are saturated, the pure crystal is an
insulator, and no further electrons can be accommodated. Additional
slots for electrons are available at a price of at least 1 electron-volt; but
these states are extended over the whole crystal like plane waves with
a well-defined wave-vector k. Their energy depends on k in a rather
complicated manner that is not easy to understand a priori and differs
drastically in Si and Ge; this dependence is expressed in the so-called
dispersion function Ec(k). All these states form the so-called conduction
band, which is empty in the ideal crystal, in contrast to the valence band,
which is normally occupied.
The extra electron makes up a linear combination of the plane-wave
like conduction states so as to be localized near its donor impurity. In
order to minimize its kinetic energy, wave vectors k near the minimum
ko in the dispersion function Ec(k) are selected. The kinetic energy of
the electron is then assumed to be

"Vqr qz qr .

158

The Anisotropic Kepler Problem

(11.1)
where the quadratic form in the vector k - ko has already been
diagonalized by choosing the appropriate directions in position space.
The coefficients are written so as to give them the physical dimension
of a mass. A classical momentum p can be associated with the wave
vector k - ko according to the de Broglie relation p = li(k - k0 ).
The expression ( 11.1) and the de Broglie relation is all we need for
the discussion of the AKP; but two further complications will be mentioned, although we will not consider them because they are well understood and are not involved in the chaotic features of the problem.
First, there are six equivalent minima in Si, and four equivalent minima
in Ge, due to the cubic symmetry of the crystal lattice. This degeneracy
can be fully discussed and treated by the standard methods of group
theory, and will be ignored. Second, the extra electron takes a glimpse
at the exact chemical properties of the donor impurity to see whether
it is P, As, Sb, or Bi. The resulting shifts affect all the energy levels in
a global manner without influencing their differences; again these shifts
will not be considered any further.
The Hamiltonian for the AKP now becomes
2

3

P2 + P3
--+--2ml
2m2
P1

(11.2)

where the crystal symmetry in Si and Ge is responsible for the equality
of the second and the third mass, m2 = m3 . The so-called cyclotron
experiments in the semiconductors give precise values for these effective masses. In terms of the usual free electron mass m1, one finds that
m 1 = .916 m1 , m2 = .1905 m1 for Silicon,
(11. 3 )
m 1 = 1.588 m1 , m2 = .0815 m1 for Germanium.
Again, the large differences in the values of the effective masses are
not easy to explain although they can be obtained from elaborate numerical band calculations. The large mass-anisotropy makes it impossible to treat the AKP as a perturbation of the usual Kepler problem.
When the energy levels of a donor impurity became of interest in
the 1950s, the energies of the lowest states for the Schrodinger
equation corresponding to the Hamiltonian (11.2) were first found by
Kohn and Luettinger (1954 ), with the help of very simple variational
wave functions. Their results were improved by Faulkner ( 1969) who
used a basis of 9 such functions, thereby getting a number of excited
states. Wintgen, Marxer, and Briggs ( 1987) have recently extended the

11.1 The Donor Impurity in a Semiconductor Crystal

159

basis to well over a thousand states, with the purpose of looking for
chaotic features in the spectrum. Recent experiments by Navarro,
Haller, and Keilmann (1988) give energy levels with three-figure accuracy.
The author (Gutzwiller 1971, 1973) was the first to examine the
classical behavior of the AKP, and to discover its hard chaos. This
chapter is devoted to the exclusive discussion of the classical trajectories, but the AKP will be taken up in Chapter 17 as the prime example
where the transition to quantum mechanics can be examined in great
detail. Nevertheless, many questions are still open even for this special
example, as will be pointed out at the end of this chapter.
The anisotropy of the mass-tensor is a rather common feature in
mechanics, although the reader may not have noticed it before in connection with electrostatic or gravitational forces. The Helium atom can
have a configuration where the nucleus is the vertex of an isoceles triangle and the two electrons form the base. The relative motion of the
two electrons with respect to the nucleus has a much larger mass than
their relative motion between each other. Similarly, in the ammonia
molecule N H 3 , the three hydrogen atoms form the base in the shape
of an equilateral triangle and the nitrogen is the vertex. The regular
shape of this pyramid is preserved, but the two degrees of freedom have
quite different masses. The first demonstration of maser action was
achieved in this system with exactly this kind of vibration. Devaney
(1980, 1981, 1982) went a long way in showing the close similarity of
these systems with the AKP.

11.2 Normalized Coordinates in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem
The natural units for the AKP are the geometric mean of the masses
mo = v'm1m2 , the 'Rydberg' Eo= moe4/2K 21i 2 for the ener
and
Planck's uantum li. Further, we use the ratios J.L = mtlm 2 and
v = m2/m1 for which the product J.L v = 1. The main parameter in
the whole treatment is the mass ratio m 1 I m 2 = J.LI v whose value is
~4.8 for Si and ~20 for Ge.
The Hamiltonian (11.2) shares with the Hamiltonian of the ordinary Kepler problem its homogeneity: the kinetic energy is homogeneous of the second degree in the momenta, and the potential energy
is homogeneous of degree -1 in the position corrdinates. If all momentum components are multiplied with some positive number A, and
all the position coordinates are divided by A2 , then the value of the
energy gets multiplied by A2 . All the trajectories are preserved as sol-

160

The Anisotropic Kepler Problem

utions of the equations of motion, if the time variable is divided by A. 3 .
Thus, we can arbitrarily set the normalized energy = -1/2 in order to
investigate the behavior of the trajectories.
The components of the normalized momentum will be called
(u, v, w), and the normalized Cartesian coordinates are (x, y, z), with
the x-axis along the "heavy" direction of mass m 1• The normalized
Hamiltonian becomes

If M ::1: 0, then p > 0; the centrifugal potential M2 /2vp 2 stabilizes
the
the trajectories. As M increases from 0 to the maximum
Poincare section shows an increasing number of islands; only the limit
M = 0 shows hard chaos.
The soft chaos when M ::1: 0 has not been studied as yet. We will
concentrate exclusively on the case M = 0 with the hard chaos. Each
trajectory is then confined to a plane through the x-axis; henceforth,
we will write y for the radial coordinate p in order to emphasize the
purely plane character of the trajectories. But we will also find at the
very end that the three-dimensional nature of the problem shows up
anyhow in the count of conjugate points and in the admissible symmetries of the periodic orbits.

Notice that the force is always directed toward the origin; but the acceleration (.X, ji) tends to have a larger component in the y-direction
because the y-component of the force gets divided by v, while in the
x-direction the force gets divided by IL where IL > v.
The trajectories, therefore, intersect the x-axis more often than the
y-axis, contrary to the usual Kepler problem where any two axes
through the origin are intersected the same number of times. The
choice of the x-axis as the surface of section is then inevitable. If
y = 0, the condition ( 11.4) for the kinetic energy to be positive becomes
(11.8)
where- oo < u < + oo. The corresponding region in the (x, u) plane
has an awkward shape; its total area is 4'1Tv;-.
This region can be transformed into a rectangle by stretching every
slice (u, u + du) to go from x = -2 to x = + 2, and thinning it accordingly. The area-preserving transformation is given by the formulas
X= x(l + u 2 IlL), U = v;- arct~(u/~),
(11. 9 )
u = v;- tang(U/v;-), x =X cos (U/"y';"),
where IX I ~ 2 and IU I ~ / P: 'IT /2. The surface of section is now
a rectangle.
The most important property of the AKP is contained in the following description of the trajectories: Consider the sequence of consecutive intersections for a particular trajectory, ... (X_ 2 , U_2),
(X_t, U_t), (Xo, Uo), (Xt. Ut), (X2, U2), ... , and associate with it a sequence of binary numbers a = {. .. , a_ 2 , a_ 1, a0 , at, a2 , •• .}, where

in the (X, U) plane given by (11.9), to the square, i.e., the region in the
plane defined in (11.10), is no more than a very schematic description of any particular trajectory. If this map were sufficiently

162

smooth in any generous sense, then we could use it to define another
invariant measure in the surface of section. Notice that the sequence
of
consecutive
intersections
C~-2, 71-2), <~-I, 11-I), (~o, 1/o),
(~I, 1Jt}, (6, 112), ... obeys the simple rule,
~J+I = (~1 +sign(1J1))/2,1JJ+I = 2111 -sign(71) .(11.11)
This map is none other than the inverse of the so-called baker's transformation, i.e., stretching by a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction
and thinning by 1/2 in the vertical direction; the area in the(~, 71) plane
is preserved.
Some further comments are obvious, but they quickly get us into the
middle of the AKP dynamics. Two binary sequences which start in the
past with a uniform binary, either a1 = -1 for j < k < 0 and ak = + 1,
or a1 = + 1 for j < k < 0 and ak = -1, but with the same binaries for
indices j > k, are mapped into the same point(~, 71). The same happens for two binary sequences whose binaries are identical all the way
to some index k - 1 ~ 0, but which differ from then on in the same
manner with a uniform sequence going to +oo.
If the parameters ( ~, 11) are of any use, the two binary sequences of
the preceding paragraph should correspond to a single trajectory. Such
is indeed the case; the trajectory comes out of a collision with the origin
if the binary sequence is uniform in the past, and it goes into a collision
if the binary sequence is uniform in the future. In more detail, consider
the initial conditions (X0 , U0 ) as a function of a single parameter varying in some limited interval; the signs of all the intersections out to
some index k - 1 > 0 stay the same, but sign(Xk) changes, say from
-lto + 1, at the critical value (Xoc. Uoc). As this critical initial condition is approached from 'below', with sign(Xk) = -1, the numerical
integration of the trajectories shows an ever increasing string of sign
(Xj) = + 1 for j > k. Conversely as the critical initial condition is approached from above, i.e., with sign(Xk) = + 1, there is an ever
lengthening string of indices j > k where sign(Xj) = -1. The critical
initial condition (Xoc. Uoc) yields a trajectory that goes into the origin
at its k-th intersection.
Collision trajectories are characterized by the values of ~, or 1J, or
both, rational with a power of 2 in the denominator. They form a dense
grid in the square, which will be used in the next section to construct
numerically the map from the rectangle into the square. At this point,
such a map is still entirely based on numerical results, but some general
propositions have been proved mathematically.
Devaney (1978 a, b, and c) and the author (Gutzwiller 1977) have
shown independently, and by different arguments, the following theoEach binary sequence a, and therefore every point

-1 ::; ~ , YJ ::; + 1, can be realized by at least one initial condition
(X0, U0 ), provided the mass ratio J.Liv is larger than 9/8; the only exceptions are the totally uniform sequences, either ai = + 1 or ai = -1 for
all indices j.
The proof is largely based on a detailed study of the trajectories in
the neighborhood of a collision with the origin, which also shows that
such a collision is an isolated event, i.e., does not tak1;: place in an open
interval of the initial conditions. The AKP is more smooth in this respect than two other Hamiltonian systems where binary sequences
yield a good qualitative description: both, the isoceles three-body problem of Devaney (1980, 1981, 1982) and the bouncing-ball model of
Henon (1988) must assign open intervals to binary sequences with a
uniform past or future. All our further applications of the binary sequences are not possible in these systems. A tela (1988) has recently
studied the isoceles three-body problem with both gravitational and
electrostatic interactions; the equations of motion become identical
with the AKP if the gravitational attraction between the two identical
masses is exactly compensated by their electrostatic repulsion.
The mathematical proof for the converse of the above theorem is
still missing, however; in spite of continued efforts by a number of
people, we are only able to state as a conjecture: Each pair (~, YJ) is
realized by no more than one initial condition (Xo, U0 ), with the exception
of ~ = YJ = ± 1. The map from the rectangle into the square is a
homeomorphism, i.e., a one-to-one transformation that is continuous in
both directions.
The evidence for this sweeping statement is a vast amount of numerical computation for mass ratios > 2, coupled with checking various
special cases of the above conjecture. For example,, the symmetry of
the binary sequence is reflected in the symmetry of the corresponding
trajectory, if indeed the relation between them is one-to-one; in particular, certain simple periodic orbits must be unique, as well as symmetric with respect to the x-axis, or they-axis, or both. Nevertheless,
the situation is more complicated for mass ratios < 2, as was shown for
the first time by Broucke (1985), with more detaih~d information to
be found in the author's paper (Gutzwiller 1989); these results are
discussed in Chapter 20.

164

The Anisotropic Kepler Problem

11.4 Construction of Stable and Unstable Manifolds
The (~ , 11) parameters tell the 'story' of the trajectory; ~ for the past,
and 11 for the future. The Bernoulli sequences in Section 10.1 were interpreted in the same manner. Once the binary expansions (11.10) for
~ and 11 have been calculated, the exact order in which the trajectory
crosses the positive or negative x-axis is known, and a good picture of
the trajectory exists.
Instead of varying the initial conditions (Xo, U0 ), we can vary ~ and
11 to see how the trajectory changes. In particular, we can compare
neighboring trajectories by watching how the displacement (8~0 , 811 0 )
develops as we go from one intersection with the surface of section to
the next. Since the coordinates (X0 , Uo) are in a one-to-one continuous
relation with (~ 0 , 1/o), at least the immediate neighborhood shows the
same qualitative behavior.
The transformation of the 'square' is given by the explicit formulas
(11.11). Therefore, o~ decreases with every intersection by a factor
of 2 as one goes forward in time, i.e., with increasing index, while 011
increases by a factor of 2. A change in~ becomes less and less significant, while a change in 11 becomes more and more important, as one
goes forward in time. Just the opposite happens when going backward
in time. The trajectory is stable with respect to changes in ~. and unstable with respect to changes in 11· Of course, two trajectories which
approach each other in the future, tend to diverge in the past, and vice
versa.
The lines ~ = constant and 11 = constant are eactly the unstable (expanding) and stable (contracting) submanifolds of Section 10.6 which
are characteristic of hard chaos. The conditions ( 10.11) are explicitly
given by ( 11.11), and are almost trivial when applied to the binary sequences a. The conditions (1 0.11) are no longer obvious when going
back to the original surface of section with the coordinates (X, U); but
the map into the(~, 11) coordinates allows us to construct the stable and
unstable submanifolds also for (X, U).
If a trajectory originated in a collision at the intersection labeled
- k, it has ~ = integer/2k; if it ends in a collision at the intersection
labeled k + 1, then 11 = integer/2k. The collision trajectories form a
one-parameter family that can be represented explicitly by solving the
equations of motion ( 11.7) in the neighborhood of the origin,

~ = 3(1 + (1- 8/9/) 112 )/4, B = 3A 2 /4(2~- 3)(4~- 1).(11.13)
The right-hand sides in (11.12) are the lowest terms of an expansion
in powers of r; the higher-order terms become rapidly more complicated, and these formulas serve only to get the trajectory out of the
collision far enough from the origin so that the ordinary numerical integration can take over. The value of~ is slightly below 3/2 for Si and
Ge; the collision trajectories are characterized by the single parameter
A. For more details, cf. Gutzwiller (1977).
Given the mass-ratio J.Liv and the parameter A, the values (11.12)
of the momenta and the positions for, say, = .02 serve as initial conditions in the numerical integration of the equations of motion (11.7).
The k - th intersection of the resulting trajectory yields the coordinates (X0 , U0 ) of the surface of section. The corresponding binary
representation {0, a_k + 1, a_k + 2, ... , a_J, ao, ... .} is known from the
numerical integration for the particular value of A; this binary sequence
has been truncated on the left by setting a_k = 0 to indicate the collision. This simplification in the notation is consistent with the formulas
(11.10), and the discussion of the collisions following (11.11); the
value of ~o corresponding to (Xo, U0 ) is, therefore, known.
As the parameter A is varied very carefully, the coordinates
(X0 , U0 ) trace out a smooth curve in the rectangle. The value of
~ 0 = integer/2k does not change as long as the k-th intersection in our
trajectory does not end up in a collision. The smooth curve in the rectangle runs from a well-defined limit point on the lower boundary to
an equally well-defined limit on the upper boundary as A increases. In
fact, U0 increases monotonically with A, while X 0 may vary either way
although it stays away from the values Xo = -2, 0, 2.
The last description is again the result of the computational experience; some of these features can be shown analytically. If they could
be proven in full generality, the basic conjecture concerning the oneto-one continuous map between the square and the rectangle would
follow immediately. The above construction gives a series of smooth
curves in the rectangle as A is varied from-octo +oo, each with a label
~O· These curves do not intersect; since they run from the bottom to
the top of the rectangle, they can be ordered from left to right. Their
label go is then found to increase monotonically from -1 to + 1.
The k-th intersections for the full range of A generate 2k such curves
of constant value gin the (X, U) plane. Ask is increased the rectangle
gets covered with an ever finer set of smooth non-intersecting lines.
These are unstable (expanding) submanifolds; if one chooses two
neighboring points (X, U) and (X + 8X, U + 8 U) in the same smooth
line, the corresponding trajectories share the same value of g, but have

r

166

The Anisotropic Kepler Problem

different values of YJ. As the trajectories with these initial conditions
are integrated forward in time, their consecutive intersections with the
surface of section will move further apart just as described in (10.11).
The stable (contracting) submanifolds are constructed in the same
manner, by integrating the equations of motion (11. 7) backward in
time assuming a collision to occur at the (k + 1)-th intersection. When
the parameter A is varied smoothly, the intersection (X0 , U0 ) lies on a
smooth curve with a constant value for YJO· Everything works out in
complete analogy to the unstable submanifolds. Actually, it is not
necessary to repeat the calculation because the equations of motion
(11.7) are symmetric with respect to time reversal. The stable submanifolds in the rectangle are obtained by taking the mirror image of
the unstable ones with respect to the X-axis.
The advantage of the (X, U) coordinates over the original (x, u) is
quite clear when looking at Figure 26. The ends of the stable and unstable submanifolds are spread out along the upper and the lower
boundaries of the rectangle; but they would all be squeezed into the
infinitely far portion of the original domain (11.8) in the (x, u) plane.
Also, the stable and unstable submanifolds are clearly seen as transverse to one another in Figure 26.
The binary parameters (~. YJ) define new coordinates in the rectangle; but while the ordering of the ~ and YJ labels shows that these new
coordinates are continuous with respect to the old ones, a close look
reveals some rather irregular spacings. A detailed study in the neighborhood of the origin in position space gives more information on the
local continuity. If a displacement in the (t YJ) plane has the absolute
value e, and the corresponding displacement in the (X, U) plane has the
absolute value 8, one can define the HOlder exponent a by setting
(11.14)
e !:::= constant 8a , or , a !:::= loge /log8 ,
in the limit of 8 going to zero.
The values of a have a rather complicated multifractal distribution,
that will be discussed in Section 20.7. At this point, it is enough
term
a
to realize that a may be locally anywhere between 1/2 and 2. If the
initial conditions of a trajectory are sought for a given associated binary
sequence, i.e., given (~. YJ), the usual, linear interpolation schemes
break down. Even if a trajectory has already been found such that only
a small correction e is needed, the corresponding correction 8 in the
initial conditions may be quite large.
The construction of the stable and unstable manifolds in phase
space is the main avenue to a better understanding of the hard chaos
in a Hamiltonian system. The crucial ingredient in the AKP is the relation with the binary sequences; they constitute a sort of code, which

gives the most important physical features of every trajectory. Finding
the appropriate code seems the most important task when facing a dynamical system with hard chaos. The AKP demonstrates that such a
code can be unexpectedly simple, although the mathematical properties
of the code may still be difficult to establish. Numerical computations
are essential in finding a particular code and testing whether it is useful.

168

The Anisotropic Kepler Problem

11.5 The Periodic Orbits in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem
The one-to-one relation between trajectories and binary sequences in
the AKP makes it possible to enumerate all the periodic orbits. The
associated binary sequences are periodic, i.e., a1 + 2k = a1 ; their period
is of even length 2k because the sign of the momentum component in
they-direction alternates from one traversal of the surface of section
to the next; not only u and x, but also v have to join smoothly at the
completion of one period. The number of binaries in one period will
be called the binary length of a periodic orbit.
There are obviously 2 2k periodic orbits of binary length 2k. Their
number thus increases exponentially with the binary length, but there
are some important simplifications. First off, the order of the binaries
can be changed cyclically without changing the corresponding periodic
orbit; such a change simply moves the starting time from one intersection to the following, without modifying in any way the corresponding closed orbit in phase space.
If we choose some binary sequence of even length, (a 1, a 2 , ... , a 2k),
it may happen that it can be obtained by repeating some shorter sequence, also of even length. A periodic binary sequence which cannot
be simplified in this manner is called primitive, as is the corresponding
periodic orbit. Although many results concerned with periodic orbits
are usually phrased in terms of the primitive ones among them, it seems
that some of these results would be mathematically simpler if they were
phrased so as to cover both primitive and nonprimitive periodic orbits.
Further reductions in the number of different periodic orbits come
from the symmetries in the equations of motion (11.7). As an example,
changing the signs of all the binaries gives the same trajectory reflected
with respect to they-axis, thus a new periodic orbit. But if a trajectory
intersects the y-axis at a right angle immediately after its start, then it
is symmetric with respect to they-axis. Moreover a1 = - a_1 + 1 for
j > 0; its binary sequence is antisymmetric. From what was said in the
preceding paragraph, any place in the binary sequence can be taken as
the beginning of a periodic orbit. Thus, if there is some place where the
sequence of binaries is antisymmetric, then the corresponding periodic
orbit is symmetric with respect to they-axis. Similar criteria apply to the
symmetries with respect to the x-axis, and to time reversal. Therefore,
different periodic binary sequences may have different multiplicities
attached to them.
The search for the appropriate initial conditions is largely simplified
by these reductions due to symmetries. The number of new and different periodic orbits for the binary lengths 2k =2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 is 1,
2, 6, 14, 42, 112. As a rule, it is easy to locate the symmetric ones

11.5 The Periodic Orbits in the AKP

169

because they require the variation of a single parameter; e.g., for symmetry with respect to they-axis, it is best to start the trajectory on the
y-axis with they-component of the momentum v = 0, so that only the
initial position y has to be found. As 2k increases, however, most of
the periodic sequences are asymmetric, and their initial conditions must
be searched in the whole rectangle of (11.9).
The construction of stable and unstable submanifolds in the preceding section is crucial for this purpose. Periodic orbits have no collisions so that each one can be localized with increasing precision inside
a small parallelogram whose sides describe trajectories that come out
of or go into a collision. Since the collision trajectories are found from
varying a single parameter, such a procedure is at least systematic.
Nevertheless, the underlying instability of all trajectories continues to
make all numerical work very time-consuming. For example, with the
mass-ratio 5, the periodic orbit ( + + - + + - - ·- + + ) in Figure
27 has an stability exponent of 6.875, i.e., an error in the initial conditions gets blown up by a factor of exp(6.875)~1000 after one period.
The periodic orbits are used in the present context mainly to calculate the classical approximation for the energy levels with the help of
the trace formula. The most important ingredient there is the normalized action integral <I> in ( 11.5) to be calculated for each periodic orbit.
This task is feasible only if one can find some general effective formula
that yields <I> directly as a function of the binary code for the periodic
orbit. The author has established such an expression which works
unexpectedly well, although it is not exact.
The action integral <I> for the periodic orbits of a given binary length
2k varies over a large range. The maximum value belongs to the repetition k times of the shortest periodic orbit ( + - ) ; the minimum value
is taken by the somewhat arbitrary, but consistent assignment of 0 to
the only non-realizable periodic sequence ( + + + ... + + ). The maximum is, therefore, k times the value T = <I>( + - ) = 5.74272 for
the mass ratio 5, instead of 2'1T for the ordinary Kepler problem. The
minimum value of <I> is realized by ( - + + ... + +), and goes to the
limit 8.95 in the limit of k-+oo. The distribution is narrowly peaked and
has a well-defined mean.
Finding an effective expression for <I>(a 1 , •••• , a 2 k) requires a sophisticated fit of the computational results. In the first try (Gutzwiller
1981a), the numbers for all the periodic orbits up to binary length 10
were used. In spite of the many parameters available, such as 42 of
them for 2k = 10 in addition to the known maximum and assumed
minimum, a single parameter y was used to get the correct value for the
mean. The second try (Gutzwiller 1988a) is based directly on the
construction of the stable and unstable submanifolds in the preceding

reasonable to get the same information from either of them.

11.6 Some Questions Concerning the AKP
Several questions come up quite naturally about the nature of the
Anisotropic Kepler Problem, whose structure in phase space is really
quite simple, and yet totally unfamiliar. We will try to answer some
of them in this section; but the reader still may not feel comfortable,
unless many more results are presented requiring a lot of additional
work.
A first question concerns the connection with the ordinary Kepler
problem: how can one understand the transition from the great variety
of periodic orbits when the mass ratio differs from 1, to the Kepler ellipses, which make just one simple loop around the origin ? The periodic orbit ( + - ) has the binary representation~ == 1/3, YJ = - 1/3,
which is close to the point X= .5, U = 0 when f.l.lv = 5. This point
lies inside a parallelogram that is bounded by lines~= 5/16, ~ = 3/8,
YJ = - 1/4, YJ =- 3/8 in the Figure 26.
These curves of constant ~ or YJ can be drawn in the (X, U) rectangle for decreasing values of the mass ratio f.l.lv. The parallelogram
surrounding the point~ = 1/3, YJ = -1/3, is found to take an ever bigger portion of the whole rectangle. When the mass ratio is 1.2, almost
one half of the rectangle is contained inside the parallelogram. Therefore, almost half of the initial conditions lead to a trajectory that has
the binary sequence ( ... - + - + - + - · · · ), where the dots indicate an arbitrary sequence; the corresponding trajectory looks like a
Kepler orbit for at least three intersections preceding and following the
start.
The next question concerns the behavior of the trajectories for
mass ratios close to 1. The hard chaos which was described in this
chapter so far is limited to the mass ratio f.l.lv > 9/8. No work has
been done to my knowledge to investigate the region of mass ratio from
1 to 9/8. The peculiar limiting value 9/8 arises in the detailed study
of the trajectories close to the x-axis; they can be represented by an
expansion similar to (11.12), where the exponent {3 is given by a formula like (11.13) with v replacing f.l.; there is obviously a singularity
when f.J.Iv = 9/8. Such a trajectory has a long sequence of identical
binaries, indicating a near-collision. The collisions yield the clue to the
chaotic features, a situation that has been known for some time in the
three-body problem.

172

The Anisotropic Kepler Problem

The region of mass ratios below 2 will be discussed in more detail
in the last chapter. There is at least one isolated island ( cf. Gutzwiller
1989), to be called Broucke's island after its discoverer (Broucke
1985), in the surface of section for a mass ratio 1.5; it surrounds the
periodic orbit with the binary sequence ( + + - + + - ). The
existence of this island is hard to understand, because it does not interfere with the existence of all the trajectories belonging to the other
possible binary sequences, so that the theorem of Devaney and
Gutzwiller in Section 11.3 is still correct. Also the basic (Keplerian)
periodic orbit with the code ( + - ) remains unstable all the way down
to the mass ratio 1, although its stability exponent goes to 0.
Some mathematical methods have been developed recently to show
that there exists no integral of motion in addition to the Hamiltonian.
Yoshida (1987a and b) has applied them to the AKP; but the proofs
are fraught with rather forbidding technical details. The existence of
Broucke's island for mass ratios below 2, and presumably other islands
that could escape even a high-precision numerical search, seems to exclude any clear-cut and simple, mathematical result. Nevertheless, as
a physicist, one is tempted to accept that the AKP behaves effectively
like a system with hard chaos, in particular in its transition to quantum
mechanics.
The special trajectories along the two main axes were studied more
closely by Yoshida ( 198 7c); the collision orbits are exponentially unstable. It does not seem feasible to continue such a trajectory through
a collision in a natural and unambiguous manner, as it is in the ordinary
Kepler problem. The various qualitative aspects of the AKP have been
reviewed by Casasayas and Llibre ( 1984 ).
A final remark concerns the two kinds of entropies. Formula
( 11.15) gives good approximate values for the lengths <I> of the periodic
orbits. Unfortunately, there is no simple relation between the length
of the binary sequence and the value of <I>; in particular, the periodic
orbits with only one crossing of the negative x-axis have a finite upper
bound for <I> which is independent of the number of binaries in the
symbolic sequence. The count of periodic orbits as a function of <I>
becomes tricky, and the topological entropy is not well defined; on the
other hand, these orbits can be incorporated properly into the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, for instance, in the trace
formula of Chapter 17, because the instability of these special orbits
makes their contribution negligible.

CHAPTER 12

The Transition
from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

Since our physical intuition is so firmly grounded in classical mechanics, we have little choice but to advance as far as we can into quantum
mechanics along the trails that can be laid out with the help of classical
mechanics. To be of help in our context, they have to be usable for
regular as well as chaotic dynamical systems, and, therefore, they differ
from the ones in most textbooks. The two main guideposts are the
classical approximation for the quantum-mechanical propagator in position space and time, as first proposed by Van Vleck in 1928, and the
consistent use of the stationary phase method whenever an integral has
to be evaluated.
The topics in this chapter to be discussed in this manner include the
change of variables from position space and time to other coordinates,
and the composition of propagators for consecutive times. Special attention is given to Green's function whose controlling parameter is the
energy rather than time. The hydrogen atom is treated in momentum
space to illustrate this approach to quantum mechanics, starting with
Rutherford scattering, but then using the same formulas to get the approximate Green's function for bound states.
The usual name for this type of approach to quantum mechanics is
semiclassical, suggesting a mixture of classical and quantal ideas. We
will not follow this usage; a quantum-mechanical object like Green's
function will be called classical if it is calculated purely with the help
of classical mechanics. Although it could not have been conceived

174

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

without understanding quantum mechanics, its explicit computation
becomes a technical problem in classical mechanics and requires a
much better grasp of what is going on there than most physicists have
right now.

12.1 Are Classical Mechanics and
Quantum Mechanics Compatible?
Classical mechanics has served humanity well for three centuries. It
has been confirmed to very high precision particularly in celestial mechanics, from the naked eye observations of Tycho Brahe all the way
to the intricate orbital maneuvers of space probes. The relevance to
very small systems like atoms and molecules, however, has been severely questioned for about 100 years. The most incisive criticism is
contained in Heisenberg's uncertainty relations, which seemed to resolve the issue once for all times by setting up unbeatable limitations
to the usual classical interpretation of nature.
The boundary between classical and quantal behavior lost some of
its interest after Heisenberg's decisive results. Quantum mechanics itself has become the object of intensive studies, because it seems to
accommodate all kinds of paradoxes, i.e., situations which offend our
most sincerely held beliefs about what nature is or is not able to do,
such as Schrodinger's cat and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment.
Again, a clearcut quantitative answer to these problems exists in the
form of Bell's inequality, which has been confirmed experimentally at
least for photons; a comprehensive review was provided by Wheeler
and Zureck (1983 ). Nevertheless, quantum mechanics remains somewhat of a mystery, although it is well confirmed by all the experimental
evidence available.
This book does not intend to discuss these issues; the reader will
undoubtedly see many connections between, on the one hand, the
mainly technical problems of understanding chaotic behavior in dynamical systems, and, on the other hand, the more philosophically oriented efforts to find the conceptual basis of quantum mechanics. Since
the author does have fairly clearcut opinions on some of these
questions, the reader is entitled to know in what spirit they are getting
short shrift in the present context. For ease of further reference, the
relevant points are numbered 1 through 7.
1) In all cases of a real experiment, in contrast to an abstractly
made-up situation (sometimes called a Gedanken or "thought" experiment), two things seem to hold without exception: (a) the practical

12.1 Are Classical and Quantum Mechanics Compatible?

175

rules of quantum mechanics give unambiguous quantitative answers,
and (b) these answers have always been found to be correct, i.e., in
agreement with the measurements .
2) The discussion of the so-called 'thought experiments' in most
cases is singularly crude, i.e., removed from any awareness of the
practical consideration s in a real experiment. Time and effort is spent
on purely logical discussion, along with entirely formal manipulations
of mathematical relations. With few exceptions, the hard work of
writing down, and then solving the relevant equations for a specific
laboratory set-up has not even begun; in particular, the inevitable
presence of noise is ignored most of the time. The work of Leggett
(1978, 1980), Caldeira and Leggett (1983), as well as Grabert and
Weiss ( 1984) and their collaborators are notable exceptions.
3) Experimental techniques have advanced well beyond what the
early masters in the field of quantum mechanics could have imagined.
Some of the standard answers are now open to question, in spite of the
continued uncritical acceptance in most textbooks. For example, the
wave function of a small quantum system could conceivably be measured experimentall y, as long as relativistic effects such as pair production can be ignored.
4) The exact place in a specfic experiment where quantum mechanics interferes with our often dogmatic and simplistic philosophical
prejudices (everyone has some) is very hard to pinpoint. For example,
the breakdown of classical mechanics is probably more subtle and remote than most of the theoretical discussions so far. A similar situation
prevails in trying to understand the second law of thermodynam ics,
which started well over a century ago with Maxwell's demon, and where
the crucial failure of time reversibility is no longer ascribed to the immediate physical processes, but to the handling and, in particular, the
erasure of the relevant information (cf. Bennett 1987).
5) Classical mechanics, with some simple, but important modifications in its interpretation , can get us a long way in the treatment of
particular problems. It is essential to understand as much of quantum
mechanics as feasible, and as explicitly as possible on that basis. The
hard questions of classical mechanics can, therefore, not be dismissed
as irrelevant because they are presumably superseded by modern
physics. For example, the study, and in particular the effective enumeration, of periodic orbits, as suggested first by Poincare, has to be
met head-on.
6) The chaotic features of classical mechanics seem to destroy much
of its practical usefulness in the more difficult problems of physics and
chemistry; e.g., it would be close to impossible to define a sensible
cross-section for the scattering of an electron from a molecule as if it

176

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

were a purely classical phenomenon. The main point to recognize,
however, is that even what we now call chaos has a well-defined, if
unfamiliar structure which is perhaps no more difficult to handle than
the familiar, but exceptional, invariant tori in phase space. If this
structure is interpreted in the light of quantum mechanics it gives useful, if approximate results.
7) Quantum mechanics mitigates the destructive influence of classical chaos on simple physical processes. Indeed, quantum mechanics
is sorely needed to save us from the bizarre aspects of classical mechanics; but most paradoxically, this process of softening the many
rough spots is entirely in our grasp as soon as the nature of the
roughness is well understood.
The required tools for translating classical chaos into quantum mechanics, and thereby evading the bad classical features, are assembled
in this chapter. They will be used later; I believe that there is a great
opportunity for more work on specific examples to be treated in this
manner.

12.2 Changing Coordinates in the Action
The course of a dynamical system may be most easily described in one
coordinate system, say position and time; but a measurement on the
system may test for the value of some other variable, like the momentum. Such a situation in quantum mechanics requires the discussion
of the relevant operators and their expectation values, whereas in
classical mechanics no more than a transformation of coordinates is
involved. Nevertheless, this transformation has all the earmarks of the
quantal situation as soon as it is carried out on the action function
R(q11q1t) of (1.4) and the associated density C(q11q1t) of (1.19).
The transformation from the canonically conjugate pair (p, q) to the
new pair (J.L, p) will be performed on the final position q11 ; the double
primes will be left out in this section so as to simplify the formulas.
The final position coordinate q will be replaced by the (so far not
specified) coordinate p, while the initial position coordinate q 1 will not
be changed. Thus, the old action R (q q' t) becomes the new action
R(p q1 t). Notice that only one half of each conjugate pair appears at
time t, so that there is no conflict with Heisenberg's uncertainty relation.
As long as we do classical mechanics, there is no impediment to the
use of the canonically conjugate variable whose construction was discussed in Chapter 7. The change of coordinates from q to p can,

12.2 Changing Coordinates in the Action

177

therefore, proceed with the help of the generating function W whose
properties are established as follows. The first variation of each action
is written in the form (1.9), 8R = p 8q- p '8q'- E 8t and
8R = JL 8p - p '8q1 - E 81, so that their difference becomes
IJR- IJR = JL 8p- p 8q = IJW. The natural variables in Ware, therefore, p and q, with the canonical transformatio n
JL = aw;ap, P = - aw;aq,
(12.1)
where the generating function W has nothing to do with the dynamical
system to which the transformatio n is applied.
In order to make the appropriate replacement in the action, the old
variable q has to be given as function of the new one p; the second
equation in (12.1) is combined with first equation (1.8) to yield the
condition
p =

aR(q, q', t)
oq

=

aw(p, q)
oq

(12.2)

Notice that the solution of this equation, q(p, q', t), depends on the initial coordinate q' and the time t.
The new action is obtained from the old by writing
R(p, q', t) = R(q, q', t) + W(p, q) ,
(12.3)
and inserting q = q(p, q', t). One checks that this definition yields indeed the first derivatives
JL = oR/op, p' = - oR/oq', E = - oR/ot , (12.4)
as required in complete analogy to (1.8).
The determinant of the mixed second derivatives, C(q q' t) as in
( 1.19), gives the spread after time t of the trajectories that started in
q' and end near q. The corresponding spread in the space with the coordinates p is given the determinant C of the second--order mixed derivatives of R with respect top and q'. Using the first equation (12.4),
and taking the derivative of JL with respect q' demands a little juggling
act involving both (12.1) and (12.2); at the end, the determinant has
to be calculated.
Besides C and C, two new determinants appear:
cw =

a2 w

(12.5)

the complete relation between the two densities now becomes

or ceq q' 1) ,
1

(12.6)

where q on the right-hand side has to be expressed in terms of p, q', t.
This formula, though computationally straightforward, has two factors
whose presence is expected, namely CW to make the transition from p

178

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

to q, and C to express the density in the old coordinates; but the middle
factor is strange. Its significance will appear only after the classical
approximation to quantum mechanics has been discussed in Section 5.
As an example of the general formulas in this section, let us make
the transition from position coordinates q to momentum coordinates
p = p. The generating function is W = - p q from which follows
JL = - q and p = p according to ( 12.1 ). Leaving aside the names
(JL, p) for the new coordinates, one can write directly the new action
as
R(p q' t) = R(q q' t) - pq , p = oR/ oq ,
(12.7)
where the second equation is the condition to validate the first
equation. This is no more than an ordinary Legendre transform; the
factor CW in (12.6) becomes 1; and CR simplifies to the determinant
of the second derivatives o 2R/ oqioq1, which is the Jacobian o(p)/ o(q)
as would be expected.
The same process of classical transformations can also be used to
change the initial coordinates q', while leaving the final coordinates
q = q". For example, the energy E and the angular momentum L can
take over the function of q'. As we shall see shortly, the resulting
action function and its density yield directly the classical approximation
to the wave- function in q-space for the energy E and the angular momentum L.

12.3 Adding Actions and Multiplying Probabilities
The development of a dynamical system takes place in consecutive
time-steps, at least in what we called the Lagrangian view of nature at
the end of Chapter 1. It is then natural to ask for the Lagrange action
R 12 = R (q" q' t" - t') over a total time from t' to t", if it is already
known as R 1 = R (q q' t - t') from the beginning t' to the intermediate
time t, and as R 2 = R(q" q t'' - t) from t to the final time t". The
intermediate point q has not been specified; but it is clear that it has to
be chosen so as to allow for one continuous trajectory in phase space
to go all the way from q' to q" in the alotted time t" - t'.
Another manner of presenting this requirement is to say that the
value of the total action, R 2 + R 1, is stationary with respect to the
intermediate point q. Thus, we find the condition
oR(q" q t" - t)
oR(q q' t- t')

= 0 '
(12.8)

where the two endpoints, q" and q1 , and the time intervals are given,
and there is assumed to be a solution q = q0 • According to (1.8), this
equation stipulates the equality of the momentum at arrival in q0 with
the momentum at the departure from q0 .
The total action becomes the sum of the partial actions,
R(q11 q1 t"- t') = R(q11 q0 t' 1 - t) + R(q0 q 1 t- t') , (12.9)
provided q0 satisfies (12.8). Since we have already invoked the variational principle, we might just as well calculate the second variation
in terms of the displacements 8q = q - q0 ,
,

qj qk

R 2 + R 1 = R(q q t - t) +- 8q/ a a

The deviation from the extremum of the action is given by a quadratic
form in 8q whose matrix is given by the last term in (12.10), and whose
elements will be called Cjk henceforth.
Again the density of trajectories can be calculated with the help of
the expression ( 1.19) in terms of the mixed second derivatives of the
action. Call these determinants C 12 for the whole trajectory, with C 1
and C2 for the two partial trajectories. The same juggling act as in the
preceding section then leads to the relation

cl2 = c2 [ det cjkr 1 cl'

a2R2
a2RI
cjk = - - - +
aqjaqk
aqiqk

,(12.11)

which has the same structure as (12.6).
The interpretation of (12.11), however, is more transparent: The
density of trajectories C(q11 q' t' 1 - t') is viewed as the probability to
get to the final point q' 1 when starting from the initial point q 1• If this
process were to take place in two consecutive, independent time-steps,
then the total transfer probability c12 would be the product of the
partial ones, C2 and C 1 ; but in classical mechanics these two partial
processes are not independent, because the intermediate point q0 is
fixed by the condition (12.8). The necessary correction depends on the
second variation according to (12.11); if the second variation is small,
the matrix elements cu are small and so will be the value of their determinant. The product C2 C 1 will be enhanced thereby, as if, indeed,
there were more freedom in the choice of the intermediate point q.
The essence of Feyman's path integral in quantum mechanics is to
release the intermediate point q from the restriction (12.8). Nevertheless, the formula ( 12.11) still holds, at least approximately; the enhancement or reduction by the factor in the middle, according to the
second variation of the action integral, stems from the constructive or
destructive interference of waves, as will be explained in Section 5.

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

12.4 Rutherford Scattering
The existence of a positively charged, practically point-like nucleus in
each atom was demonstrated by Geiger and Marsden in a famous experiment which was successfully interpreted by Rutherford in 1911:
a-particles were sent into a gold-foil; some of them came out at large
angles with respect to the incoming direction. This can happen only if
they make an almost head-on collision with a very concentrated, heavy,
electrically charged object, namely the nucleus of the gold atom.
Rutherford derived a formula for the angular distribution of the
outgoing a-particles on the basis of classical mechanics. He assumed
an ordinary repulsive Coulomb potential acting between the a-particle
and the point-like heavy nucleus of the gold atom. The trajectories are
hyperbolas with the nucleus at one of the foci.
Rutherford's argument can be couched in terms of the probabilities
in the preceding section, but this time applied to the momentum rather
than the position coordinates. The resulting formula is identical with
the corresponding result in quantum mechanics; it seems that
Rutherford sometimes expressed particular pleasure at having discovered about the only formula that holds both in classical and in quantum
mechanics. In the present context, it shows that classical mechanics
can be phrased in correct quantum-mechanical terms.
The Kepler problem in momentum space is geometrically simpler
than in position space. The trajectory in momentum space, the so-called
hodograph, i.e., the plot of the momentum as a function of time, is a circle. This startling fact is unknown to most physicists although it must
have been well understood by Kepler, Huygens, and Newton who were
supreme geometers; it is mentioned in Sommerfeld's lectures on mechanics (1942). Milnor (1983) discusses the relevant geometry for a
mathematical audience, and even physicists could profit from his presentation.
Lambert's formula (1.14) with its corollaries (1.15) and (2.10)
could be used together with (12.7) to calculate the relevant action integrals and probabilities as function of the momenta p' and p". Since
the trajectories are so simple, however, their action integral can be
obtained directly. The most important formulas will now be listed, with
the task of checking left to the reader.
The trajectory of the a-particle in polar coordinates around the gold
nucleus is given by ( 1.10), which is now written as

12.4 Rutherford Scattering

where the interacting electric charges are 2e and Ze, and the angular
momentum is M. The eccentricity e is
(12.13)
e 2 = 1 + M 2E I 2mZ2e 4 ,
where the energy E > 0 for a scattering experiment, and, therefore,
e > 1. The momentum in the plane of the trajectory has the components

which is indeed a circle of radius 2mZe 2 I M centered on p 1 = 0,
p 2 = ((2mZe 21M) 2 + 2mE) 112 , as shown in Figure 28.
The geometric construction of the hodograph is straightforward: a
circle of radius J2mE is drawn in the momentum plane around the
origin; any point outside this base circle can be the center of a particular hodograph, which is then found by drawing the tangents to the
base circle. The hodograph intersects the base circle at right angles.
The base circle divides the hodograph into two separate arcs: the arc
inside the base circle is used for a repulsive potential, while the outside
arc is the hodograph for an attractive potential. The endpoints of these
two arcs on the base circle correpond to the positions of the scattering
particle infinitely far away from the scattering center.
Since the experiment is done for a fixed energy E, all the further
calculations will be based on the Hamilton-Jacobi action (2.3). In
analogy with (12.7) we have to set

S(p" p 1 E) = S(q" q 1 E) =

(12.15)

The integral is positive when q and jJ have opposite signs, as in an attractive potential; but it is negative in Rutherford scattering. If one sets
jJ = - grad V where V is a homogeneous potential, i.e.,
V(A.q) = ;\._K V(q) so that Euler's relation q gradV = KV holds, then
S(p" p' E) = K J V(q) dt, which is called the virial in statistical mechanics.
The trajectories in momentum space, i.e., circles intersecting a fixed
based circle at a right angle, will reappear in Chaptm 19 as geodesics
on a surface of constant negative curvature. The relation between the
two constructions is easily recognized if we write down the virial for
the Coulomb problem with positive energy. Since the coordinate q and
the increase in momentum dp are parallel, the integrand in (12.15) re-

duces to 2me 2 l dp l/(2mE- p 2 ), which is exactly the Riemannian
metric on a surface of Gaussian curvature -1 /2m£; notice that
p 2 < 2m£. The variational principle of Euler and Maupertuis (cf.
Section 2.3) applies to momentum space as well as to the usual position
space.
The explicit calculation proceeds in two steps. First, the angular
momentum M has to be expressed directly in terms of p" and p'; if 1J

(12.17)

These two formulas have been written explicitly because they will be
used in Section 6.
The Rutherford scattering formula could be obtained systematically
by calculating the density D(p" p' E) from (2.7); but the result follows
more directly from (12.16). At large distance from the gold foil, the
a-particle has only kinetic energy so that p 2 = P 2 = 2m£; the angle 1J
is then the total deflection suffered by the a-particle, i.e., 1J is the
scattering angle 8. Formula (12.16) simplifies to

In order to complete the argument, the initial probability for the
a-particle to have its angular momentum in the interval (M, M + dM)
has to be stipulated. If the impact parameter s is the distance of the
a-particle from the straight line through the gold nucleus and parallel
to its initial direction of motion, then M = s ~;. The a-particle
approaches the gold nucleus through the annulus of area dA =
2'TTs ds = 2'TTM dM/2mE, which becomes
dA = (Ze 2 /2£) 2 dr!./( sin fJ/2) 4 ,
(12.19)
where dr!. = 2'TT sin fJ dfJ is the solid angle into which the a-particle
scatters. All the physics of the Rutherford scattering formula (12.19)
is contained in (12.16); the rest is kinematics.
Although this approach to the scattering problem seems unnecessarily lengthy, or even artificial, it is not so much the fact that the result
happens to be quantum-mechanic ally correct, as the possibility to solve
quantum-mechani cal problems classically, which makes this whole exercise worthwhile. As a consequence of the remark at the end of Section 12.2, the initial probability distribution in terms of the impact
parameter s and the angular momentum M can be given a more consistent formulation; since one measures the initial coordinates s and the
direction of motion, it is natural to use them in the action S rather than
the initial momentum p'. In order to carry out the classical analysis,
they have to be considered as one half of a set of canonically conjugate
variables in phase space. But as we emphasized earlier, these extra
variables do not enter into the expression for the action or the density
of trajectories, so that the Heisenberg uncertainty relations are not violated. Rowe (1987) has recently given a detailed picture of the classical limit of quantum-mechani cal Coulomb scattering, where the
surfaces of constant action are constructed to show the progressive
waves.

184

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

12.5 The Classical Version of Quantum Mechanics
The fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics cannot be derived from
classical mechanics. Once they are known, however, it is natural to
look for the opening that leads from the narrow classical confines to
the wide open quantum fields. The usual passageway is built on the
assumption that the classical system is integrable, or has no more than
one degree of freedom, whereas the trail to be used here will also allow
chaotic systems to pass. The crucial formula was first written down by
Van Vleck in 1928, shortly after the discovery of Schrodinger's equation.

The transformations of the action and the density of trajectories in
Sections 2 and 3 can now be interpreted very convincingly.
The important step is to replace the density C(q" q' t) of ( 1.19) by
its square root. More precisely, a complex-valued function, Kc(q11 q' t),
called the (quasi-)classical propagator, is defined by Van Vleck's formula,
Kc(q''q' t) = (2'fTili)-n/\/C(q"q' t)

exp[(i/li)R(q"q' t)- icp],(12.20)

where (2'fTili) 112 is always an abbreviation for (2'fTii) 112 exp(i'fT/4).
The phase cp will be specified later as a multiple of 'fT /2; it was not part
of Van Vleck's original work and was first introduced by the author
(Gutzwiller 1967) in his derivation of (12.20) from Feynman's path
integral. More detailed studies along these lines are due to Mohring,
Levit, and Smilansky (1980); cf. other references there.
In the special case of a free particle in Euclidean space, the expression (1.5) for the action integral can be used in (12.20), which then
yields
K(q 11 q' t) = (m/2'TTilit)n 12 exp[im(q11 - q') 2 /21it]. (12.21)
We have written K instead of Kc. because it will turn out in the next
chapter that the expression ( 12.21) is already correct in quantum mechanics; it is not an approximation like the more general (12.20).
The absolute square of Kc differs from C in ( 1.19) by (2'TTii)n in the
denominator. As we pointed out at the end of Section 2.4, the double
differential dnq" dnq' C(q11 q' t)/ (2'TTii)n can be understood as the
probability of finding the system after the time t in the volume element
dnq" of position space, if it was in dnq' at the beginning t = 0.
The propagator for Kc describes a wave which originates in q' and
spreads to q"; its name comes from its main property which is contained in the integral formula

(12.22)

12.5 The Classical Version of Quantum Mechanics

185

where t" > t > t', and the ~ sign has been inserted because the integral
has been evaluated by the stationary phase method. The proof of
(12.22) will now be sketched.
The Van Vleck expressions are inserted on the right-hand side of
( 12.22 . The integrand consists in the product of the two roots,
C 1C2 , and an exponential whose exponent is the sum (R 2 + RJ)/Ii
of the actions that were defined at the beginning of Section 3. If the
variation of this sum covers many multiples of 2'1T as the intermediate
position q ranges over its domain, then the integral depends only on the
neighborhood of a stationary point q+qo, in the nomenclature of Section 3. The two roots are assumed to vary slowly in that neighborhood
because they are not gauged against Planck's quantum li. This way of
approximating the integral is called the stationary phase method.
The value of the integral is now obtained by inserting the expansion
(12.10) in the neighborhood of the stationary point q0 . The computation has thereby been reduced to the integral
(2'1Tili)- n/ 2

f

dn q exp[i oqj cjk 8qk/21i] '

(12.23)

which is a slight generalization of the Fresnel integral. The matrix c1k,
given by (12.11), is real and symmetric; it can be diagonalized by an
orthogonal transformation of the variables of integration oq. The integral becomes then a product of n Fresnel integrals, each of which
looks like

f

d~ exp(iA~ 2 /21i) =

(2'1Tilrz) 112

( I A I)

1/2

exp[i'IT(sign(A)- 1)/4],

(12.24)

where A is one of the n eigenvalues of the matrix CJk· The product of
the eigenvalues is the determinant which appears in the second factor
of(12.11).
The right-hand side of (12.22) is now compared with the left-hand
side where we insert again the Van Vleck formula (12.20): The various
roots match exactly because of (12.11), and the exponents match because of (12.9). The only possible discrepancy arises because of the
phase factor in (12.24), which yields a factor exp(- i'IT/2) for every
negative eigenvalue in the second variation ( 12.10). Accordingly, we
now adopt the following rule for the definition of the phase cf> in
(12.20):
The root in the Van Vleck formula (1 2.20) is always taken on the
absolute value of the determinant C(q" q' t), and the phase cf> is defined as 'IT I 2 times the number K of conjugate points along the trafl

186

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

In view of Morse's proposition in Section 1.5, relating the signs of the
eigenvalues in the second variation to the number of conjugate points,
the integral formula (12.22) has, therefore, been proven under the assumptions of the stationary phase method.
In most situations, there is more than just one trajectory going from
q' to q" in the fixed time t. The classical propagator is then simply assumed to be the sum of terms like (12.20), one for each trajectory,

Kc(q'' q' t) =

L (2'TTil1)-n/ /C exp[iR/11 - itm /2] .
2

(12.25)

class .traj.

At this point, the superposition principle of quantum mechanics has been
used; but the computation of each term in (12.25) is still entirely done
within classical mechanics. The trigger for the system in the position
q' has produced different waves, each following its own mainly classical
trajectory to the position q"; the result is simply the sum of the individual waves.
If the whole sum (12.25) is inserted for each occurrence of Kc in
(12.22), there will be all kinds of mixed terms on the right-hand side,
corning from partial trajectories which do not form a complete continuous trajectory in phase space; call them broken trajectories, because
their direction of motion changes abruptly. The stationary phase
method eliminates them all because they do not satisfy the condition
(12.8). The associated exponents never settle to a condition where the
expansion (12.1 0) can be used; in other words, the integral vanishes
because of the destructive interference between these broken trajectories even over small domains of the intermediate position q.

12.6 The Propagator in Momentum Space
The expression ( 12.25) is usually called semiclassical, because it is a
mixture of classical and quanta! ideas; as mentioned earlier, we will call
it simply classical, because the burden of computing it explicitly for any
special example lies completely within classical mechanics. With the
help of the stationary phase method, (12.25) can be transformed into
the classical approximations for all kinds of useful quantum-mechanical
objects. Although we will not give the details of the calculations, the
reader is encouraged to do the hard work of deriving the general formulas before using any of them in some special example.
Bound states in quantum mechanics often have a better classical
approximation in momentum space than in position space. The hydrogen atom is a particularly glaring example, as will be seen in Section
12.8, where the reasons for this peculiar situation will be explained.

12.6 The Propagator in Momentum Space

187

The experience from the preceding section together with the discussion
in Sections 2 and 3 makes the required formulas for the transformation
from position to momentum coordinates almost obvious. We will,
therefore, only write down the results, and point out the relations with
the earlier work which could have motivated the formulas in the first
place.
If the correct quantum-mechanical propagator in position space is
called K(q" q1 t), without the index c in (12.20), which indicates the
classical approximation, then the Fourier transform KF(p"p' t) is given
by

(12.26)
(2'1Tii)n Jd nq"fd nq K( q" q t) exp [i(p q - p " q )/li] '
and represents exactly what is needed in momentum space. This rather
abstract expression becomes more understandable if it is applied to the
classical propagator (12.20), or more generally to (12.25).
If these expressions are inserted into (12.26), the integrand again
consists of an amplitude, the root of a determinant, and an exponential;
the exponent is [R(q11 q1 t) + p' q' - p"q' 1 ]/li. Notice that this exponent corresponds exactly to the action function (12.7), except that
both space coordinates, q" and q1 , are now transformed, whereas only
q" = q was transformed at the end of Section 2.
The stationary phase method for doing the integral (12.26) requires
that the exponent be stationary with respect to the variation of both
q" and q1 , not only q as in (12.7). The second variation around the
stationary point is, therefore, a quadratic function in 2n variables, and
the Fresnel-type integral corresponding to (12.23) leads to the root of
a 2n by 2n determinant. This determinant has to be manipulated
somewhat, and then yields the expected result, namely the Van Vleck
formula (12.20) with the variablesp' 1 andp', instead of q" and q1 , and
in terms of the action function R(p" p 1 t) rather than R(q" q1 t).
There are now two forms for the classical propagator, Kc(q" q1 t)
and KFc(p" p' t), which apply to position space and to momentum space
respectively. They can both be composed as in (12.22) because they
depend on time t rather than energy E. Both of them will now be
converted so as to have the energy E as their parameter rather than the
timet.

188

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

12.7 The Classical Green's Function
The conversion from time to energy is accomplished quite generally
by the transformation that defines Green's function,
G(q" q1 E) = (ili)- 1

fooc dt K(q" q t) exp(iEt/li) , (12.27)
1

with an entirely analogous formula to relate the propagator
KF(p" p' t) of (12.26) to the Green's function GF(p" p' E). Notice that
the integral is extended only over positive times; it is a Laplace integral,
since one can add a small positive imaginary part ie to the energy,
E-+E + if, and insure the convergence of the integral. The Green's
functions are, therefore, defined in the whole upper half of the complex
energy plane.
The Van Vleck formula (12.20) is inserted on the right-hand side,
and the stationary point of the exponent, R(q" q' t) + Et, as a function
of time is determined; the condition to be satisfied is exactly the last
equation (1.8), aR/at =-E. The stationary value of the exponent is
the Hamilton-Jacobi action S(q" q' E); the second variation is simply
(a 2R/ at 2 )8t 2/2.

The Fresnel integral ( 12.24) in one dimension can be used. The
determinant C has to be expressed in terms of the action S(q" q' E), a
task, that was already carried out in Section 2.4. In combination with
()2Rj at2 = - [()2Sj ()E2]-I from the Fresnel integral, the amplitude
becomes the square root of the density D(q" q' E), which was defined
by (2.7).
The classical Green's function Gc(q" q' E) becomes
2 '1T
"""· / ( -l)n + 1D exp[ _j_S(q"q'E)- i~t'TT/2],(12.28)
.LJV
fi
(2 'TTl'li)(n + 1)/2 cl.tr.
where the factor ( -1 )n + 1 in front of D insures that the expression
under the square root is positive for short trajectories. The phase \fl is
again defined as '1T /2 times the number IL of conjugate points, but the
relevant conjugate points in (12.28) are obtained from varying the
trajectory at constant energy E, rather than at constant transit time t
as in (12.25).
In order to understand the difference, we have to return to (2.7),
which relates the amplitude C(q" q' t) for (12.25) to the amplitude
D(q" q' E) for (12.28). The singularities inC determine the number"
of conjugate points in (12.25); these are at fixed q' the exceptional
points q'' and times t that the system can reach with different energies
E, i.e., 8E =!: 0 while 8q' = 8q" = 8t = 0. In going over to D with
the help of (2.7), however, the amplitude Cis divided by a 2R/at 2

12.7 The Classical Green's Function

189

which is just - 8E/8t according to (1.8). The singularities along the
trajectory from q' to q 11 where 8t = 0 are thereby canceled, and new
singularities are introduced every time 8E = 0. These are the places
where the trajectory can be displaced infinitesimally while keeping
both endpoints as well as the energy fixed; they are the conjugate
points when the trajectory is restricted to vary on the surface of constant energy.
The expression (2.10) forD shows that there are two varieties of
conjugate points entering into the total count J.L in (12.28): ordinary
caustics on the energy surface come from the singularities in the determinant of (2.10); but the points of classical return where q = 0
also contribute, although they are comparatively rare in a system with
two or more degrees of freedom. On the other hand, these classical
return points, where the potential energy V(q) = E, yield exactly the
phase loss of 'TT /2 that is known in one-dimensional systems from
Kramers' connection formulas. All these considerations apply in momentum space, provided the Hamilton-Jacobi action S and its second
derivatives in D are replaced everywhere by the virial S (p" p' E),
given by (12.15), and its second derivatives.
Again, one can work out the classical Green's function for a free
particle in Euclidean space by inserting the expression (2.5) of the
classical action S(q" q' E). The resulting classical Green's function
Gc(q'' q 1 E) is
(2 E)(n + 1)/4
m
exp[iy'2mE
E (2TTili)(n + 1)/21 q" - q' I (n- 1)/2
'TT

~" - q' l/li](12.29)

In contrast to the propagator (12.21), this expression is only an approximation to the correct quantum-mechanical Green's function for
the free particle, if the Euclidean space has an even number n of dimensions; it is correct, however, when n is odd.
The formula (12.28) for Gc is the basis for the so-called trace formula, which relates the spectrum of energy levels to the collection of
periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system and which will be
discussed in some detail in Chapter 17. Before calculating GFc, the
classical approximation of Green's function in momentum space, for
the Kepler problem in the next section, a major failure of all Green's
functions as compared with the propagators has to be mentioned.
There is no analog for Green's functions to the composition (12.22)
that holds for the propagators. The role of the propagator, as its name

indicates, is to describe the evolution of the dynamical system at the
time t", by taking the appropriate average over all the relevant features
at the intermediate time t. When performing this averaging operation

190

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

over the relevant features of the system at the timet, one can fall back
to the description for an even earlier time t'. This simple idea is expressed in (12.22) for the special case of Kc; but it is true for all the
other propagators. Quite in contrast, there is no sensible modification
of this principle that holds for any of the Green's functions.
The calculation that comes to mind would be something like

J

dnq Gc(q'' q E) Gc(q q' E) ,

in the hope that it can be shown to yield Gc(q'' q' E). The stationary
phase method should work in the present context; but the reader will
find that the various determinants that arise will not combine appropriately to give the desired result. The main consequence of this failure
is that the Green's functions cannot be calculated by anything resembling
Feynman 's path integral for the propagators. This crucial difference will
be discussed later in more detail; it is mentioned here because it is already visible in the classical approximations (cf. Gutzwiller 1988c).

12.8 The Hydrogen Atom in Momentum Space
All the questions about a particular dynamical system in quantum mechanics can be answered if either the propagator or Green's function
is understood well enough. The reader is asked to accept this statement
on faith for the time being, because there will be ample arguments in
favor of this view in the remaining chapters. Of course, one could
dismiss such a claim as devoid of any significance, since there is no use
trying the impossible, i.e., to get either the propagator or Green's
function for a complicated system if indeed that would answer all the
questions.
In practice, we will settle for something less, namely the trace of
Green's function; but in the case of the hydrogen atom, one can do
more, and thereby demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, which
works for chaotic systems as well as for integrable ones. In particular,
the sum over the classical trajectories in (12.28) can be carried out
explicitly for the Kepler problem. The calculations for Green's function could be worked out in position space with the help of Lambert's
formula (2.11); but the detailed expressions would be complicated just
like the series ( 1.14). There is a good reason for these complications
in position space, which does not apply to the treatment of the Kepler
problem in momentum space.
If the total energy E < 0 in an attractive potential, the classical
trajectories are restricted to the volume in position space where the

12.8 The Hydrogen Atom in Momentum Space

191

potential energy V(q) < E. In general, the situation is actually worse
as was shown in Section 2.5 for the Kepler problem; the Kepler orbits
are restricted to the inside of a critical ellipse, which depends on the
given energy E and the point of departure q'. The classical Green's
function Gc is expected to be singular on the boundary of the accessible
volume, whereas the correct quantum-mechanical Green's function G
is well behaved there, and continues beyond. Thus, aside from being
mathematically more complicated, Gc is not even a good approximation
to G.
A similar difficulty arose when we discussed Rutherford scattering
in momentum space in Section 12.4; the trajectories had to stay inside
a circle of radius /2mE . Such a restriction also arises in position
space when a particle scatters from a repulsive potential, since the trajectories are then restricted to the volume V(q) < E, which excludes a
neighborhood of the scattering center itself. Most remarkably, however, no limitation of this kind comes into play in momentum space for
the bound states of an attractive potential.
The equations (12.12) through (12.14) are still valid, except that
the product of the charges 2Z = - 1 and E < 0. The hodograph remains a circle, which, however, is now characterized by intersecting the
base circle of radius / - 2mE in diametrically opposite points, as
shown in Figure 29. The hodograph goes around the origin of the
momentum plane; the trajectory does not stop on the base circle as it
did in the repulsive potential.
The formula (12.16) for the angular momentum M can be rederived, but turns up unchanged. The integral for the virial is no more
difficult, and the final result as written in (12.17) still holds; but the
quantity r is now purely imaginary. Notice that r does not depend on
the electric charge, whereas the sign of the interaction appears in the
factor in front of the logarithm. As r becomes imaginary the logarithm
changes into an arctang, and the factor i gets canceled by the /2mE
in the denominator. Altogether, the virial becomes
--

S(p" p' E) = 2 u arctangv- r2 ' u =

s

me

2

/-2mE

' (12.30)

where 2 is defined in (12.1 7); the negative sign in the square root is
welcome because now E < 0.
For a brief discussion of this formula, let us start the trajectory on
the base circle. Asp" moves away from p' the arctang increases, until
its argument becomes oo when p" reaches the point opposite p' on the
base circle. The virial S then becomes 'TT u; and twice that amount upon
completing the whole hodograph, i.e., Kepler ellipse.

192

The Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

Figure 29 The hodographs in a Coulomb field for fixed E < 0 through a given
initial momentum p' are circles which intersect the reference circle of radius
/ - 2mE in diametrically opposite points.

An arbitrary endpoint p" can be reached from the equally arbitrary
starting point p' in two distinct trajectories: directly, i.e., with a virial
less than ., a and given by (12.30); or indirectly, i.e. with a virial
greater than ., a and given by 2., a minus (12.30). In the latter case,
the trajectory also passes a double counting conjugate point (single
counting in two dimensions). The whole situation is exactly the same
as for the geodesics on a sphere at the end of Section 1.5; indeed, Fock
(1935) treated the hydrogen atom in momentum space as the free
motion of a particle on a sphere.
In addition to these two simple trajectories, the final stop at p" can
always be delayed until the particle has gone through an arbitrary
number of complete orbits. Each time the virial is increased by 2., a,
an amount that does n9t depend on either p' or on p". Therefore, when
-l)n + 1D is calculated from (2.7), it will not
the amplitude factor
depend on the number of times the orbit has been traversed. With each
completed orbit the trajectory picks up four conjugate points when
moving in three dimensions (only two in two dimensions), as was discussed at length at the end of Chapter 2.
Finally, the determinant D(p" p' E) has to be worked out by inserting (12.30) into (2.7), replacing everywhere q by p. That is obviously a fairly messy affair, which has to be carried out with some
judgement; the main ingredient is to use polar coordinates in momentum space and to notice that S depends only on the absolute values of
p' and p", as well as their scalar product.

sin (2 o arctangP )/ sin(7T o),

with the o and r as defined in (12.30) and (12.17). This formula was
derived by the author (Gutzwiller 1967) in his first paper on therelation between classical and quantum mechanics. It yields not only the
correct bound state energies, but also the correct bound eigenstates,
apparently the only instance where this happens on the basis of a classical approximation, except in the trivial case of plane waves. It illustrates the basic idea of using Green's function to find classical
approximations for the spectrum, an idea that works also in classically
chaotic systems. Norcliffe and Percival (1968), and then with Roberts
(1969), obtained essentially the same results independently of the author; they coined the name 'correspondence identities' to convey the
idea that in the case of the hydrogen atom the classical approach can
yield exact quantum-mechanical answers.
The poles in the complex o-plane are found where sin7To = 0, i.e.,
o is a non-zero integer. (When o = 0, the numerator in (12.31) vanishes, thus canceling the zero in the denominator.) Therefore, the poles
of the classical Green's function are found at the ent!rgies,
E = - me 4 /2n 2fi 2 ,
(12.32)
as Bohr was the first to find out.
More remarkable, however, is the expression for the residue at this
pole; in terms of the Bohr momentum Yn = me 2 /nli, and the angular
variable f3 = 2 arctang~ where E has been replaced by (12.32),
the residue can be written as
(- l)n + 1(8n/7T2)y~(p'2 + y~)- 2(p"2 + y~)- 2 (sinnf3n/sinf3n) (12.33)
The quotient sinn/3/sin/3 is a rational function of p' and p", as can be
seen by first expanding sinn/3, and then expressing the sines and cosines
rationally in terms of arctang~. Finally, the residue is written
as the sum over n 2 products q,(p") q,(p'); each function q,(p) is exactly
one of the normalized eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom in momentum space. (See Bethe and Salpeter (1957) for the details of these
wave functions.)

CHAPTER 13

The New World
of Quantum Mechanics

The study of possible chaos in quantum mechanics is less than two
decades old, and the results so far are not nearly as clearcut and systematic as in classical mechanics. The interesting examples have all
been quite simple, however, and the essence of quantum mechanics is
not in question. The reader is assumed to be familiar with most of the
general precepts as well as the standard methods of wave mechanics.
They will be reviewed briefly in this chapter with special emphasis on
the later applications.

13.1 The Liberation from Classical Chaos
The need for a new kind of mechanics arose at the beginning of this
century for reasons that had nothing to do with the discovery of chaos
in classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics developed for the next 75
years and succeeded in solving many important problems in physics,
while blissfully unaware of anything more complicated than perturbation theory. A 1977 conference in Como, Italy, was probably the first
to bring together the two strands (cf. Casati and Ford 1979). Therefore, why not leave a good thing alone since it has served us so well
without any lapse in the comparison between experiment and theory ?
The main reason for trying to bring about some kind of reconciliation between classical chaos and quantum mechanics is strange, in-

13.1 The Liberation from Classical Chaos

195

deed. While classical mechanics gives good results on the atomic scale
in certain exceptional situations as in Rutherford scattering, its answers
in most cases are clearly absurd. For example, the classical scattering
of an electron from a simple molecule consisting of more than three
atoms is a case of hard chaos as we shall see in Section 20.1, and no
sensible cross-section can be obtained. If nothing else, quantum mechanics is needed to provide at least reasonable answers where classical
mechanics fails to satisfy our most elementary expectations for an acceptable, let alone correct, result.
Quantum mechanics has liberated us from the scourge of classical
chaos, and we will find that the symptoms of chaos are hard to pin
down in this new environment. So again, why should we even bother
to track them down if they are so elusive? First, the problems in
quantum mechanics are hard to solve even though they are well defined
in terms of mathematical relations and conditions to be satisfied. Second, our intuitions and instincts have as yet to adjust to the new mechanics; it almost looks as if a real understanding of a complicated
situation on the atomic scale requires a close tie with classical mechanics.
The principles of quantum mechanics enter, of course, into this
mixed interpretation in terms of classical trajectories; the final answers,
while acceptable or even good, cannot be expected to be correct to the
last decimal; but they are at least understandable intuitively, rather
than being the result of a monstrous numerical calculation. The basic
ingredients to this uneasy compromise are the formulas of the last
chapter; nobody could have guessed them without first getting acquainted with the new wave mechanics.
Aside from these philosophical considerations, there are good reasons to study quantum-mechani cal systems whose classical behavior is
chaotic. Not only are they more typical than the integrable systems;
but they reveal significant differences in the character of their wave
functions, the distribution of their energy levels, the response to outside perturbations, the dependence of the scattering phase-shift on the
momentum, and so on.
Many applications of quantum mechanics have had the primary
purpose of solving special problems, and comparing the results with the
outcome of the corresponding measurements in the laboratory. In
contrast, the concern with chaos is based on the hope of gaining some
systematic awareness for all the possibilities in quantum mechanics.
Many special cases are investigated and compared with one another,
although very often they are not directly related to a particular experimental set-up; they are chosen because their classical behavior is cha-

196

The New World of Quantum Mechanics

otic, and they differ from one another in some important qualitative
feature.
This work is now in full swing approximately for a decade, and
many partial results have been obtained; but no systematic treatment
is in sight, even compared with the rather moderate generalizations
concerning soft chaos in classical mechanics. The remaining chapters
of this book constitute, therefore, an effort to organize what is known
so far under some general headings, rather than to present a coherent
overall view. The field is very productive right now, and a painful selection among many worthwhile results is unavoidable.
The importance of these recent researches lies in the questions they
ask and the kind of answers they are trying to establish. Just as the
examples of chaos in the earlier chapters are bound to find their way
eventually into the textbooks on classical mechanics, the physicists in
general will become aware of the issues which are discussed in the next
chapters. Quantum mechanics may then become better appreciated in
all its tremendous but subtle variety, and some of its mysterious ambiguities may become better understood.

13.2 The Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation
Schrodinger's equation is the simplest statement of the principles of
quantum mechanics. It requires the complex-valued wave-function
lf;(x, y, z, t) to satisfy the partial differential equation
12 2

integrable, with a finite integral over all space which can be normalized
to 1, provided the right-hand side of (13.1) is self-adjoint. This condition presents no difficulties for the potential energies V(x, y, z, t) that
will be discussed in the coming chapters, including the scattering
problems. In the presence of a magnetic field, the Laplace operator is
modified in a rather obvious manner, which will be discussed in Chapter 18.
A case of particular interest arises when V = 0 inside some given
domain D, and V = + oc outside D. Then, the wave function o/ = 0 on
the boundary of D; the boundary of D acts like an ideal mirror in optics. Some popular examples of chaos are exactly of this type, like the
Sinai billiard and the Bunimovitch stadium (cf. the end of Section
10.3).

13.2 The Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation

197

The Laplace operator on a manifold with a Riemannian metric

ds 2 = gJk dx1 dxk has the form

~ = (1/vg)(<1/<1x)( vg gika;axk) + K/4 ,

(13.2)

where g = det(g1k), and gik is the inverse of the matrix gJk· There is
a quasipermanent discussion among the specialists whether or not to
add a term proportional to the Gaussian curvature K that can be calculated from the metric tensor gJk (cf Section 19.1). In two dimensions,
there is little doubt in my mind that it should be K/ 4 as indicated in
(13.2), while in three dimensions it is simply K, at least provided the 3
by 3 curvature tensor is a multiple of the unit-tensor, as in the spaces
of constant curvature such as the sphere. Some details on this controversy will be given as the opportunity arises in Section 19.5.
Schrodinger's equation plays the role of the equations of motion in
classical mechanics, either in the Lagrangian form ( 1.3) or in the
Hamilton-Jacobi form (2.2). The physical information, however, is
contained in the solutions of these equations, particularly in the action
integrals (1.4) and (2.3). Similarly, the physics of quantum mechanics
is directly obtained from the propagator K(q" q' t) that is the value of
the wave function in q'' at the time t > 0 if it was concentrated in q' at
the time t = 0. This formulation is only valid if the potential V in
(13 .1) does not depend on time; otherwise, it is necessary to use it two
times to define the propagator, t' for the starting concentration in q',

(13.4)

where the double prime on the Laplacian indicates that the differentiation is done with respect to q". Notice that the propagator is defined
for times t ;::= 0, and that for definiteness one may set K(q" q' t) = 0 for
t < 0. For a free particle, i.e., if V = 0, the propagator takes the simple
form (12.21), which results directly from Van Vleck's formula (12.20).
The name propagator has been chosen for this function because it
tells us how the effect of the potential V spreads the wave functions
from q' to q" in the given time t. This spreading phenomenon is a
stepwise process that can take the system first from the starting positions q' to the intermediate position q in the time T > 0, and then from
q to the final position q" in the time t - T > 0. The final result of this
two-step process is obtained by compounding the partial results from

198

The New World of Quantum Mechanics

all the possible intermediate positions. Mathematically, this crucial
property of the propagator is expressed as
K(q" q' t)

=

J

dq K(q" q t - T) K(q q' T) ,

(13.5)

where the integral extends over all position space, and the fixed intermediate time T can be chosen anywhere in the interval 0 < T < t. This
relation can be checked for the free particle propagator (12.21) with
the help of the Fresnel integral (12.24).
The ability to compound the propagator as indicated in (13.5) is
similar to the idea that was first proposed by Huygens as an explanation
for optical phenomena (cf. Baker and Copson 1950; Born and Wolf
1959, chapter VIII; Gutzwiller 1988c). Light behaves like a sequence
of spreading pulses; every point that has been reached by a pulse is the
source of a new pulse whose amplitude is proportional to the amplitude
of the arriving pulse.
The propagator K also represents a spreading pulse; but in contrast
to the optical pulses, which spread at the speed of light, the quantummechanical pulses spread at all speeds. There is no limiting relation
between the distance I q" - q' I and the time t for Schrodinger's
equation; of course, its relativistic generalization, Dirac's equation, is
subject to the finite speed of propagation.

13.3 The Stationary Schrodinger Equation
If the potential energy V does not vary with time, Schrodinger's

equation ( 13.1) can be simplified by assuming that the wave function
an
exponential
time-dependence,
1/;(x, y, z, t)
=
has
cp(x,y, z) exp(- iwt). The stationary wave-function cp(x,y, z) satisfies
the time-independent Schrodinger equation,
- (f? /2m) tlcp + V(x,y, z) <P = E <P , E = liw . (13.6)

The condition on <P to be square integrable, with a finite value for the
integral, limits the acceptable solutions of this partial differential
equation.
Without going into the spectral theory of linear operators, we will
assume henceforth that there exists a spectrum, i.e., an ordered set of
energy levels Eo ~ E1 ~ ... Ej ~ .. . to each of which belongs a welldefined normalized eigenfunction cpj(x,y, z). There may be degeneracies
in the spectrum, i.e., consecutive energy levels may actually have the
same value; but they affect only a finite number of energy levels at any
given energy.

13.3 The Stationary Schrodinger Equation

199

The spectrum is denumerable as indicated, provided the space
available to the wave functions is compact. This condition is not satisfied in many realistic situations, e.g., the Kepler problem; above the
denumerable spectrum, there is then a continuous spectrum where the
energy E varies continuously, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are
not easily normalizable. This continuous spectrum is of special importance for scattering problems, and the reader is asked to brush up on
his or her knowledge of wave mechanics in this respect. The demands
are quite elementary in the present context.
The principal property of the spectrum is its completeness, i.e., its
ability to approximate to arbitrary accuracy any reasonable function in
the form

L c1 cf>/x,y, z) ,

cp(x,y, z) =

(13.7)

j = 0

where the sum may have to include an integral over the continuous
spectrum, if the space is not compact. We will, in general, not bother
to write down this integral over the continuous spectrum, although we
will not imply that it can be neglected. The completeness can be expressed in the formula for the Dirac 8-function

This formula looks like a Fourier expansion of K with respect to time
t; but it should be remembered that the time is restricted to t ~ 0. Indeed, if one inserts (13.9) into (12.27), it is better to think of the integral over time as a Laplace transform, where the energy E may have
a positive imaginary part e. When each term is integrated separately
over t, one finds Green's function in the explicit form

In the Euclidean space of odd-numbered dimension, Green's function of a free particle is given by the formula (12.29); again, the classical approximation is exact. In the even-numbered dimensions,
however, Green's function is a Bessel function in the distance
Iq" - q' I with a logarithmic singularity at the origin; formula (12.29)
gives the asymptotic expression for large distances.
In contrast to the propagator K, Green's function G does not satisfy
any simple relation like (13.5). Formula (13.11) is an elliptic partial
differential equation; therefore, its solution in function of the coordinates q" is analytic, i.e., it can be expanded everywhere in a convergent
power series. The effect of even remote obstacles or boundaries is always felt; it does not have to wait for a wave to get there.
Many physicists live under the erroneous impression that Green's
function can somehow be compounded, and that it can be interpreted
as a step in the spread of the wave function, at the given frequency
w = E/li, from the starting point q' to the endpoint q". To see the
fallacy of this view, it suffices to replace everywhere the propagator K
in (13.5) by Green's function G from (13.10) with the same value of
the energy E throughout (cf. also the end of Section 12.7). The two
sides of the presumed equality do not match (cf. Gutzwiller 1988c);
Huygens idea does not apply at constant frequency !

13.4 Feynman's Path Integral
The propagator K can be constructed quite explicitly by making repeated use of the fundamental relation (13.5). This idea comes from
Dirac, and was incorporated into the second edition of The Principles
of Quantum Mechanics (Dirac 1935, p.125). A time interval from 0 to
t is broken up into N pieces, of equal size for simplicity's sake,
0 < t 1 < t2 < .... < lN-I < tN = t. The propagator from q' = Qo
to q" = QN now appears as an (N- 1)-fold integral over all the intermediate positions Qt. Q2, ... , QN- I·
It is hard to understand why Dirac stopped at this point of the argument, and left to Feynman (1948; for an updated version see also the
monograph of Feynman and Hibbs 1965, as well as Schulman 1981
and 1988) the task of completing the picture, more than a decade later.
Since each time step is very short, the propagator can be effectively
approximated, in the hope that the cumulative effect of the errors is
reduced by increasing the number N of intermediate time intervals.

13.4 Feynman's Path Integral

201

The free-particle propagator (12.21) takes care of the Laplacian in
(13.4). What is the effect of the potential energy V over a short time
interval?
While the particle remains in the neighborhood of, say (x,y, z), for
the time 8t such that 8t V(x,y, z) < < fl, the propagator maintains its
absolute value, and changes its phase by the factor
exp(- iV(x,y, z) 8t/fl). We can assume that a good value for the position (x, y, z) is the starting point q'. The propagator for short times
&, therefore, becomes
( "
')2
(m/2TTifl8t)n 12 exp { ; [ m q ~q
- V(q')&]} . (13.12)

2

The -sign in front of the potential energy in (13.12) is crucial.
Feynman recognized that the expression inside the brackets is the
Lagrangian (not the Hamiltonian!) of a classical particle which moves
from q' to q" in the short time &. The factor in front is a somewhat
bothersome normalization which guarantees the correct reduction in
the amplitude as the particle moves; it is part of the free-particle
propagator (12.21), and appears automatically, if the expression (1.5)
for the free-particle action integral R(q" q' t) is inserted into Van
Vleck's formula (12.20).
Let us now define a polygonal path in position space by the sequence
of points (q', t') = (qo, to), (qi, t1), ... , (qN- 1, tN- I), (qN, tN) =
(q", t"). The Lagrangian action for this path is well approximated by
the sum

The (N- 1)-fold integral can be interpreted as adding up indifferently
the contributions from all the possible paths that lead from q' to q" in
the given time interval from t' tot". Hamilton's principal function RN
was defined in (13.13) as a Riemann integral where the position q in
the Lagrangian can be chosen arbitrarily in the interval (qk _ 1, Qk). In
the presence of a magnetic field, however, it is crucial to adopt the
midpoint rule, which requires that q = (qk _ 1 + Qk)/2 (cf. Schulman's
treatise on Path Integrals, 1981, Chapter 4).

202

The New World of Quantum Mechanics

Integrals like (13.14) were studied first by Norbert Wiener in the
early 1920s, with the crucial difference that the combination il1 in
( 13.14) is replaced by a positive number, basically a diffusion constant.
The integral then becomes absolutely convergent with the proper precautions on the potential V, and can be shown to satisfy the conditions
corresponding to (13.3) and (13.4), also known as the Fokker-Planck
equation (cf. Wang and Uhlenbeck 1945, Kac 1959).
Feynman's integral (13.14) is very difficult to handle mathematically in a rigorous manner comparable to the Wiener integral. (For an
introduction into this topic cf. Koval'chik 1963, and Kac 1966a.) The
many efforts in this direction, while technically successful, seem physically wrongheaded. They do not account in a straightforward way for
the constructive and destructive interference between the individual
paths, which is due to their phase factors exp(iRN/Ii). Even some of
the large-scale numerical computations which are based on the path
integral circumvent this difficulty by falling back on the Wiener integral. The price for doing so is that only the lowest state of the quantum
system can be obtained, as evidenced in the Feynman-Kac formula
(Cf. Schulman 1981, chapter 7).

13.5 Changing Coordinates in the Path Integral
The path integral (13 .14) will be used as it was originally conceived
by Feynman, as a way of getting correct answers, even though the
mathematical procedures are not easily justified. As an example of this
philosophy, we propose a recipe for transforming the coordinates in the
description of the paths from the Cartesian as in ( 13.14) to some other,
such as polar coordinates. The subtleties in such a transformation have
to be approached with great care; a unique source for the required
procedures is the monograph by Schulman (1981).
The conditions to be satisfied in such a change concern the moments in the expression (13.12) for the short-time propagator. They
are

When a magnetic field is present, the right-hand side of (13.15b) differs from 0, and becomes the electromagnetic vector-potential ; the

13.5 Changing Coordinates in the Path Integral

203

right-hand side of (13 .15c) is the inverse-mass tensor which is nontrivial in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem.
Let us now try to express the short-time propagator (13.12) in
terms of spherical polar coordinates (r, 8, x) with the usual relations
x = r sin 8 cos x , y = r sin 8 sin x , z = r cos 8.
The conditions
(13 .15) on the first three moments with respect to q" and q' can only
be satisfied by the expression
(ml28t) [(r" - r') 2 + r" r' ( 8" - 8') 2 + r" r' sin 8" sin 8' (x" - x') 2}

- ot [V(q') + (11 2l8mr"r')(1 + 11 sin 8" sin 8')},

(13.16)

to be placed inside the brackets in the exponent of (13.12). It is important to write the coordinates in the kinetic energy as symmetrically
as possible.
The expression (13.16) is the integrand for Hamilton's principal
function as resulting from Feynman's path integral in spherical coordinates; the classical approximation can be expected to require the new
terms proportional to 11 2 . In terms of the total classical angular momentum L, the Hamiltonian that comes out of (13 .16) has the kinetic
energy consisting of the radial part, if/2m, and the angular part,
( IL I 2 + 11 2I 4) I 2mr2. If one proceeds from this modified Hamiltonian
to apply the rules of classical quantization (cf. next chapter), one finds
without any additional tricks that I L 1 2 + 11 2I 4 = (E + 1/2) 211 2 , and,
therefore,
the
correct
quantum-mechanical
result,
2 = E(f + 1)11 2 where£
I L 1
is an integer ~0.
The additional terms in (13.16) look like the potential energy due
to an extra angular momentum of strength 1112. That is exactly the
term Kl 4 to be added to the Laplacian on the two-dimensional sphere
which was already included in (13.2). It arises here as the direct consequence of maintaining the first three moments of the short-time
propagator as given in (13.15). This curvature correction arises also
in spaces of negative curvature as was shown by Gutzwiller (1985b)
as well as Grosche and Steiner (1988); the motion in such a space will
be the subject of Chapter 19.
There does not exist at present a simple rule which would permit
one to perform a general canonical transformation of the coordinates
in the path integral. Some special cases have come up recently, such
as the transformation of the Kepler problem with the help of the
Kustanheimo-Stiefel coordinates (cf. Duru and Kleinert 1979: Ho and
Inomata 1982). The new Lagrangian is quadratic in the coodinates, so
that the path integral can be worked out analytically; but there is also
a change in the time variable which has some experts worried.

204

The New World of Quantum Mechanics

13.6 The Classical Limit
The path integral is the ideal tool to find out what happens when
Planck's quantum fi becomes small compared with the prevailing values
of the Lagrangian action integral RN in (13.14). If the path is allowed
to vary freely, the phase angle of the integrand in ( 13.14) goes many
times through 2'17, and the individual contributions destroy one another.
This destructive interference does not happen in the neighborhood
of those paths whose Lagrangian action does not change under small
variations of the path. Of course, these are exactly the classical trajectories because the first variation of their Lagrangian actions vanishes as explained in Section 1.2. The value of RN for the neighboring
paths is then well approximated by the second variation which was
discussed in Section 1.5. The integral (13.14) becomes a Fresnel integral like ( 12.24) whose quadratic form is the second variation of the
Lagrangian action RN
Although the full calculations along this line of reasoning are tricky,
and will not be carried out, their end-result is not in question. Morette
(1951) was the first to obtain Van Vleck's formula (12.20) from
Feynman's path integral; but the method of Papadopoulos (1975) is
closer to our way of looking at this essential task. We shall mention
only the main ideas without going into the full derivation; Albeverio
and Hoegh-Kron (1977) have given a full mathematical treatment,
while Levit and Smilansky (1977) approach the problem more closely
in the spirit of this book.
The second variation in the exponent of the path integral (13 .14)
a
is quadratic form in the function space that describes all the possible
displacements from the classical path; this quadratic form has to be
diagonalized exactly as in the transition from (12.23) to (12.24). The
integral then has an amplitude factor, (II I A I )-I/ 2 , and a phase factor
that is simply exp[ -i(# of A< 0) 'IT/2). The amplitude factor can be
shown to become ( I C(q II q' t) I ) I /2 . Because of Morse 's theorem (cf.
Section 1. 5), the phase factor subtracts 'IT I 2 from the phase angle for
every conjugate point along the classical trajectory from q' to q11 • A
more traditional way to derive the phase loss near a conjugate point
consists in expanding the solution of the wave equation near the
caustic; the parallel motion is a plane wave, whereas the perpendicular
motion is treated through the WKB approximation (cf. Ludwig 1975
and references therein).

13.6 The Classical Limit

205

In this straightforward manner, we end up with the Van Vleck formula (12.25) for the classical approximation Kc(q" q1 t) to the
quantum-mechanical propagator K(q" q' t). This derivation has been
carried out in many forms by different people during the last 40 years
(cf. Marette 1951; Choquard 1955); but they got stuck at the first
conjugate point where the amplitude in Van Vleck's formula becomes
singular, and it is then difficult to judge the quality of the approximation. The author was the first, however, to extend its validity beyond the first conjugate point, and to apply Morse's theorem to the
phase loss of 'TT /2 at each conjugate point (Gutzwiller 1967).
It was shown in the last chapter how the Laplace transformation of
the classical propagator Kc with respect to time leads to the classical
Green's function Gc, and to a formula (12.28) very similar to Van
Vleck's. It is this last form of the classical approach to quantum mechanics which seems most useful: in particular, (12.28) will be interpreted as far as feasible as an aproximation to (13.10). The full-blown
comparison between the exact (13.10) and the approximate (12.28)
will be investigated in this book only for exceptionaR cases such as the
hydrogen atom. We will, however, concentrate on a reduced version
which is obtained by taking the trace in both (13.10) and (12.28). The
resulting trace formula provides the most direct method of connecting
classical chaos with quantum mechanics.
Although there is no simple analog for Feynman's path integral to
yield the quantum-mechanical Green's function G(q" q' E), there is a
direct and obvious analogy between Van Vleck's expression (12.25)
for the quasi-classical propagator Kc and the quasiclassical Green's
function Gc of (12.28). Both are sums over all the classical paths from
q' to q"; both look equally like the reduction of an original sum over
all paths, although that is true only for the Kc, and not for Gc.
Green's function G(q", q1 , E) can formally be written as an integral
over 'histories' in phase space (cf. Garrod 1966), i.e., an alternating series of positions q and momenta p, such as q' = qo , Pl/2 , q1 , P3/2 , ...
, qN- 1 ,PN- 1/2, qN = q" (for more details cf. Gutzwiller 1967). The
trouble with this approach is, as far the author can tell, that the continuous 'histories' are no longer prevalent, as they are in Feynman's and
Wiener's integral.
Daubechies and Klauder ( 1982, 1989) as well as Klauder ( 1988 and
1989) have proposed a path integral in phase space that works with
complex values for both the position and the momenta. It is not clear
whether this formal generalization simplifies the problem of justifying
the path-integral mathematically, and of finding the classical limit.
Phase space is a problematic concept in quantum mechanics because
of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations; it seems preferable, at least in

206

The New World of Quantum Mechanics

the present context, not to face all the issues that are raised by, and the
many efforts that are concerned with, the phase-space version of the
path integral.
While the summation over all paths requires some kind of integration in a space of functions, the sum over all classical trajectories
remains a sum over a denumerable set of terms. That set is entirely
determined by the classical mechanics of the system and represents the
best as well as the worst of chaos depending on the problem. Its application to (12.25) or (12.28) constitutes an entirely novel view of
classical chaos, which subjects its structure to a stringent test, of the
kind which could never have been proposed by a classical mechanician
before the arrival of quantum mechanics.
If the classical expression (12.28) is indeed an approximation to
G(q", q', E), then its functional dependence of q", q' and E has to
mimic (13.10). In particular, there have to be poles on the real £-axis
in the sum (12.28), which can then be interpreted as energy levels, with
the residues yielding the corresponding wave functions, exactly as we
found in the Kepler problem at the end of the preceding chapter. There
is no guarantee known at this time that anything like simple poles will
occur as the result of some arbitrary Hamiltonian, but we will see cases
later on where this turns out to be true.
The author hopes that the direct evaluation of the sum (12.28),
where each term keeps its complex value, consisting of an amplitude
and a phase factor, may eventually become feasible for most systems
of interest. If the structure of classical chaos is indeed as rigid as one
has every reason to suspect, the necessary mathematical manipulations,
and perhaps even their rigorous justification, may be easier than today's approaches to the full-fledged Feynman path integral.

CHAPTER 14

The Quantizat ion of
Integrable Systems

Quantum mechanics was first developed and tried out on a few
integrable systems, such as the harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom,
and the electron in a rectangular box. In spite of the conceptual differences between the classical and the quantal regime, the mathematical connection is quite close in these special cases. Some of the
relevant methods can be carried over into systems with soft chaos, and
seem to yield reasonable results, as if quantum mechanics were capable
of riding smoothly over the rough spots in classical mechanics.
This chapter presents first the construction of wave functions in the
integrable cases with the help of classical mechanics, as proposed by
Keller on the basis of Einstein's critical insights. Different ways of
applying these ideas to softly chaotic systems are then discussed, along
with their presumed justification. As in most of the topics in this book
from here on, the final verdict is not in as yet; the reader is expected
to disagree with some of the loose speculation, and is encouraged to
think of new ways to understand the examples.
Many theoreticians have tried to find a systematic expansion in ascending powers of 11; for instance, Voros (1977 and 1986) discusses a
mathematically sophisticated method for obtaining asymptotic
/1-expansions of stationary quantum states. Reluctantly, I have concluded, however, that no method has succeeded as yet in yielding
higher-order corrections to the lowest approximation that was proposed in Chapter 12, except for a simple quantity like the density of

208

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

states (cf. the corrections to Weyl's formula in Section 16.2). But it
seems that, even there, it is only possible to improve on some average
over many quantum states, whereas the discrete nature of the spectrum
depends entirely on our primitive first order for which no useful corrections are available at this time.

14.1 Einstein's Picture of Bohr's Quantization Rules
Niels Bohr proposed a number of ad hoc rules in 1913 to modify the
classical mechanics of the Kepler problem, in order to obtain the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. The spectacular success of Bohr's
ideas, in all their apparent contradiction, was explained 12 years later
with the advent of wave mechanics. Meanwhile, Bohr's rules of
quantization were generalized and tried out on other systems. Among
the best-known contributors were Sommerfeld and Epstein, but they
as well as Kramers got stuck when it came to considering more complex
atoms such as helium.
Einstein ( 191 7) turned the whole question around and asked which
mechanical systems could be subject to the Bohr-Sommerfeld-Epstein
rules. In his customary low-key, intuitive manner he came up with a
much more direct view of the basic ingredients in terms of the invariant
tori which so far no physicist had ever talked about. He went on to
point out that the absence of these tori in phase space prevents any use
of the quantization rules and removes the system from being 'quantized' in this way. Such systems form the majority in Einstein's view,
and he quotes Poincare to back up this conclusion.
There seems to be only one reference, Lanczos ( 1949), to this paper
in the ensuing 40 years. Such total neglect of an incisive comment on
a 'hot subject' by the world's best-known physicist is almost beyond
comprehension, in particular, since many close colleagues wrote large
and learned reviews of the whole topic in the early 1920s. Most outstanding among these is the great treatise by Sommerfeld (1919, 1922,
1931) which went through several editions; but there is also a book by
Born (1925, 1927), and two lengthy survey articles by Pauli (1926b,
1929) for two separate Handbooks; even Van Vleck (1926) wrote a
report of more than 300 pages for the (American) National Academy
of Sciences.
The existence of invariant tori is the hallmark of integrable systems;
their construction was discussed in the first three sections of Chapter
3. Einstein did not need these general considerations, since he got his
insight from studying a special case. Einstein's example, a particle in

14.1 Einstein's Picture of Bohr's Quantization Rules

209

a cylindrically symmetric potential, was presented in Section 6.1; the
reader should review this section in order to appreciate the next steps.
The value of the action integral/_j in (3.2) does not depend on the
exact choice of the contour c1 . Indeed, if there are two topologically
equivalent loops, C and c', the difference of the corresponding action
integrals I - t is the integral f p dq taken over the combined path
C - c'. Since the loops are equivalent, this last contour integral is the
same as a contour integral over a loop r, which can be contracted to a
point. According to Stokes's theorem, the line integral over r is equal
to the surface integral of the curl, extended over the inside of r. But
the integrand for the line integral is p dq = I Ijiw1 in action-angle variables and the curl for the latter vanishes on the invariant tori because
the value of each 11 is a constant.
The last step in this argument can be phrased in more general terms.
Stokes's theorem, converts any line integral fp dq over a closed contour
into a surface integral frt(8, Ll), where Q is the canonical two-form
(7.1). The surface is bounded by the closed contour, and the contour
can be contracted to a point inside the surface, exactly as C- c' is
contracted on the invariant torus. The two-form Q represents the curl
of the one-form w(d) = I p J dqi
The two-form becomes
Q(8, Ll) = I(8!1 Llw1 - 8w1 Lll_j) in action-angle variables. The invariant torus has, therefore, the special property that Q(8, Ll) = 0 for
any two tangent vectors 8 and Ll. A manifold of phase space with this
property is called a Lagrangian manifold; its dimension can be at most
equal to the number of degrees of freedom. The Lagrangian character
of a manifold is maintained as time develops because of (7.3).
As soon as the invariant tori are established, e.g., with the help of
a surface of section, any closed loop c1 on a given torus can be used to
compute 11. There are as many topologically independent loops as there
are degrees of freedom. In contrast to the earlier versions of the
quantization rules, it is not necessary to perform explicitly the separation of variables; indeed, in some cases like the Toda lattice the separation is difficult to carry out. More importantly, the whole idea of
separating variables loses its rigorous foundation as soon as a small
perturbation has destroyed even a small portion of the invariant tori in
conformity with the KAM theorem.
One of the action variables in the cylindrically symmetric potential
of Section 6.1 was the angular momentum M ; Bohr's original rule was
to make the conserved angular momentum equal to a multiple of fi =
Planck's quantum divided by 21T. Einstein's quantization condition assigns a multiple of 21Tfi to every conserved action integral, e.g., the radial action N in Section 6.1. Therefore,

210

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

(14.1)
where the contour c1 can be any closed loop on an invariant torus.
The Hamiltonian of the system can be written as a function
H(/ 1, .... , In) of the actions I, as was explained in Section 3.2 and 3.3;
e.g., H 0 (M, N) was obtained by solving the equation (6.2) forE as a
function of M and N. In the space of the actions (M, N), the
quantization conditions (14.1) determine a lattice of mesh-size ll.
Since the function H 0 (M, N) is smooth, the resulting spectrum of energy
levels, i.e., the set of energies H 0 (n 11l, n21l) obtained in this way, has
certain characteristic properties which will be discussed in Chapter 16.
Chapter 6 was devoted to the classical periodic orbits, and their
construction was described quite generally for an integrable system in
Section 6.2. Each periodic orbit was characterized by as many integers
as degrees of freedom. Notice that each energy E has a full complement of periodic orbits; the action integral S = f p dq for each is a
well-defined function of the energy. There is no direct relation, however, between the periodic orbits and the spectrum of energy levels,
although an indirect connection will be established in Chapter 16. The
quantization condition ( 14.1) does not imply that the trajectory on this
particular torus is a periodic orbit. Figure 30 shows the typical situation on an invariant torus.
Einstein's derivation of the quantization conditions (14.1) makes it
clear that only integrable systems can be treated in this manner. The
Helium atom is not integrable as the theorem of Bruns and Poincare
shows (cf. Section 4.1); the formulas (14.1) cannot even be written
down. Since it is possible to write down Schrodinger's equation, however, and its energy levels can be found with the help of some largescale computations, we are left to ask whether the classical mechanics
of the He atom can tell us anything about its quantum-mechani cal
properties. While this special problem is still unresolved, important
progress has been made in the last two decades on certain modifications of the hydrogen atom (presence of a magnetic field as explained
in Chapter 18, anisotropic mass tensor as in Chapter 11, perturbation
by a periodic electric field, cf. the experiments of Bayfield and Koch
197 4, as well as the theoretical work mentioned in the review of
Bayfield 1987) to connect classical trajectories with the quantal energy
levels in spite of chaotic behavior.
This fundamental issue concerning classically chaotic systems was
raised for the first time in Einstein's 1917 paper, in the more narrow
context of Bohr's quantization rules. Even when Keller (1958) finally
discovered this paper, and interpreted it in the light of Schrodinger's

Marcus (1977)].
equation, he was only concerned with integrable (and possibly nonseparable) systems of which he and Rubinow (1960) gave many novel
and interesting examples. Most textbooks in quantum mechanics are
still stuck at an even earlier stage, where the explicit separation of
variables seems the necessary condition for the classical approximation.

14.2 Keller's Construction of Wave Functions and Maslov Indices
A separable dynamical system can be integrated simply by choosing the
appropriate coordinates in position space; the hydrogen-ion molecule
(Section 3.4) and the motion of a particle on a triaxial ellipsoid (Section
3.5) are of this type, but not the Toda lattice as explained in the last
two sections of Chapter 3. The separation of variables carries over into
Schrodinger's equation without difficulty; the classical kinetic energy
remains quadratic in the momenta so that the new kinetic energy operator contains no more than second-order derivatives of the wave
function.
The degrees of freedom are properly separated by writing the wave
function as a product of functions, each of which depends only on one
coordinate. Each factor then satisfies a one-dimensional Schrodinger
equation whose solution can be approximated by the WentzelKramers-Bril/ouin (WKB) method (cf. Dicke and Wittke 1960 p. 245).
The quantization conditions ( 14.1) are now modified in some circumstances, because the particle may be confined to a potential well, and

the wave function spills into the classically forbidden region where the
kinetic energy would be negative. The Kramers connection formulas
become important (cf. Pauli 1933 p.171, and 1958 p.92), and the
conditions (14.1) are modified by replacing the integers n1 with the
half-integers n1 + 1/2, a well-known consequence for the harmonic
oscillator.
This standard method has to be used with caution, however, and can
yield poor results when corrections to order 11 2 appear; such is the case
in a potential of spherical symmetry V(r). Schrodinger's equation
( 13.6) separates in polar coordinates; the eigenfunctions for the angular
dependence are the Legendre functions, and the eigenvalue for the
angular momentum squared is I L I 2 = £( £ + 1 )11 2 with an integer
£ ? 0. Schrodinger's equation for the radial motion, therefore, has the
centrifugal potential£(£+ l)li 2 /2mr 2 ; its eigenvalues for the Coulomb
potential are given by m e 4 I n 211 2 where n is a positive integer, as found
originally by Balmer. Everything is fine!
A rather common procedure, however, is to discuss the radial
(three-dimensiona l) Schrodinger equation in terms of the WKB approximation even though the the angular dependence of the wave
function was taken into account exactly, with I L 1 2 = £(£ + 1)11 2 . The
relevant classical Hamiltonian is then ( 6.1), and the quantization condition, including the phase loss at the classical turning points due to the
Kramers connection formulas, yields N = (v + 1/2)11 for the radial
action (6.2) with an integer v ? 0. The energy levels are obtained from
the (two-dimensional) formula (6.3) where I Ml in the denominator
is replaced by I L I= ~ £(£ + 1) ll; the denominator is no longer the
square of an integer as in the Balmer formula. The mixture of exact
solution for the angular motion and WKB approximation for the radial
motion causes a mistake of order 11 2 .
Various tricks have been invented to avoid this pitfall, the best
known is attributed to Langer (193 7); but as far as the philosophy in
this book is concerned, there are only two possible ways out. The first
has been mentioned in Section 13.5: Feynman's path integral has to
be written in the new (polar) coordinate system in order to find out
what the equivalent classical Lagrangian has to be. An additional term
equivalent to 11 2 /8mr 2 appears which has to be added to the
Hamiltonian ( 6.1) from the very start in order to treat the threedimensional problem. The angular momentum M in the centrifugal
term of ( 6.1) is, therefore, replaced by W - I L 12 + 11 2 I 4. The second way out is to avoid the separation of the coordinates altogether,
except for the computational work, and stay with the Van Vleck formula (12.25) and its constant-energy version (12.28).

14.2 Keller's Wave Functions and Maslov's Indices

213

The construction of the wave function based on classical mechanics,
independent of the explicit separation of the variables, starts from the
following remark: Every invariant torus provides a double covering of
the classically allowed region in position space, unless the torus has a
complicated shape in phase space and its projection into position space
covers certain parts more than twice, as shown in Figure 31. Each
piece of this projection is characterized by a unique assignment of a
momentum p to a position q. In Einstein's example (6.1), the energy
E and the angular momentum M fix the value of the azimuthal component of the linear momentum at a given distance r; but the radial
component (called p in Section 6.1) has two possible values, differing
in sign, and corresponding to the two pieces of the invariant torus
which cover the annulus between r 1 and r2 •
The wave function on each piece of the projection is obtained by
writing
cf>(q) = A(q) exp[iS(q)/li] ,
(14.2)
where both A(q) and S(q) are real, and A ~ 0. To lowest order in li,
they satisfy the first-order partial differential equations,
H(CJS/ CJq, q) = E,

div(A 2 CJS/ CJq) = 0 ,

(14.3)

where the first is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (2.8), and the second
insures the continuity of the flow in position space for a fluid of local
density A 2 and local momentum CJS/ CJq.
This flow is continuous on the invariant torus, although the particular representation ( 14.2) in the position-space projection has
singularities in the higher derivatives of S(q) along the boundaries. A
closer look (cf. Figures 30 and 31) shows that the boundaries are the
caustics for the trajectories of the flow; the momentum p is tangential
to the boundary; the component at right angles to the boundary vanishes. The wave function in the neighborhood of the caustics can be
separated locally into a motion parallel and perpendicular to the
caustic. Whereas the parallel motion proceeds as a plane wave, the
perpendicular motion is approximated in the same manner as in the
Kramers connection formulas, with the help of Airy functions, and
yields a phase-loss of 'TT/2 just as in Section 12.5.
The phase of the wave function consists, therefore, of two (or
more) parts corresponding to the pieces of the invariant torus that
project into position space: inside each piece, the phase is approximated by the classical action S(q)/li which is continuous and finite at
the boundary. There is a loss of '1T /2 at each transition from one piece
of the projection into another with the flow on the torus.
Instead of thinking of the approximate wave function as defined in
position space, Keller puts it on the torus and defines it by (14.2) on

each piece of the projection. If cp(q) has to be determined for the position q, then the sum over all the projections into q is formed. The
phase factor of the wave function on the torus, with all the phase losses
on the caustics, has to be well defined; and this in turn requires that the
cumulative phase changes for any closed contour on the torus be a
multiple of 2'17. In this way the slightly more general conditions arise,

where n1 ~ 0 and {31 ~ 0 are integers. Notice that the quantum number
n1 can indeed vanish as in the ground state of the harmonic oscillator;
but then the number {31 of boundary crossings cannot be 0 at the same
time.
That is exactly the detail that Pauli could not know in 1919 when
he treated the hydrogen molecule ion in his Ph.D. thesis for
Sommerfeld, as was mentioned in Section 3.4. Instead of setting
n = 0 and f3 = 2 for the radial motion with respect to the axis of the
molecule, he chose n = 1 and, of course, f3 = 0. The resulting energy
came out to be positive, and he concluded that the hydrogen molecule
ion is only metastable.
The integer {31 is called a Maslov index, in honor of V.P. Maslov who
did basic work on classical approximations to quantum mechanics
during the 1960s (Maslov 1972, 1981 ). It can also be understood as
the number of conjugate points, or Morse Index for trajectory, as
discussed in Section 1.5. The latter concept is more general and fundamental, since it applies to any Hamiltonian system.

14.2 Keller's Wave Functions and Maslov's Indices

215

The Maslov index, however, can be defined independently of the
trajectories with their caustics and conjugate points, provided the system is integrable. The motion then takes place on a Lagrangian manifold, as mentioned in the previous section, and the Maslov index is
determined by the topology of the Lagrangian manifold in phase space
with respect to position space. From this more general perspective,
even the Morse index for non-integrable systems can be defined, provided one studies the Lagrangian manifold which is generated by a
particular trajectory and its neighbors in phase space. This approach
is investigated by Littlejohn (private communication); the practical
calculation of the Maslov indices has been studied recently by
Littlejohn and Robbins ( 1987), as well as Robbins and Littlejohn
(1987).
The quantization condition (14.4) for integrable systems, and the
construction of the wave function that goes with it, has been given the
name of EBK quantization, for Einstein, Brillouin, and Keller; similar
ideas were proposed independently by Laudauer (1951 and 1952).
Keller's work is particularly valuable because it uses Einstein's invariant tori and offers many new examples. Related ideas have been promoted mainly by mathematicians under the heading of geometric
quantization; a readable first account of this development can be found
in the book by Souriau (1970).

14.3 Transformation to Normal Forms
The surface of section (cf. Chapter 7) shows quite clearly whether a
particular dynamical system is integrable or not. If there are only few
invariant tori left on the surface of constant energy, the construction
of wave functions in the preceding section cannot be carried out. How
can one still get some useful information about the energy spectrum
from the classical system in such a situation of soft chaos? An appeal
to Van Vleck's formula (12.25) or (12.28) may be very difficult because it requires a complete enumeration of the classical trajectories.
This enumeration can be performed in hard chaos, as we shall see later,
but it has defied most efforts in soft chaos.
The KAM theorem assures us that the transition from integrable to
chaotic is not discontinuous, in general. The break-up of the invariant
tori takes place near trajectories with rational frequency ratios, and
leaves the tori with algebraic frequency ratios intact. The transition
regime presents, therefore, an intimate mixture of invariant tori and
chaotic regions.

216

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

Neighboring, concentric-looking, invariant tori in the surface of
section can be used to estimate the degree of dissolution due to chaos.
Let us take the case of two degrees of freedom where the surface of
section has two dimensions. If the area between two invariant tori is
smaller than Planck's constant h, we can speculate that quantum mechanics is able to ignore the complications of the chaotic behavior, and
continue its relation with classical mechanics as for integrable systems.
This idea has been used with rather unexpected success in different
ways; the most convincing is the method of transforming the
Hamiltonian to a normal form, which will be discussed in this section.
As usual, the guiding principle is not diffficult to understand, although the technical details have to be worked out carefully, and may
lead to some significant differences depending on the system at hand.
We will follow the work by Delos and Swimm (1977 and 1979), which
goes to back to the paper by Gustavson (1966), who in turn relied on
the seminal work by Birkhoff (1927). The results of the last two authors was briefly reported in Section 8.4; canonical transformations
are used to eliminate systematically all unwanted perturbations (cf.
Section 5.3).
The starting Hamiltonian describes the motion of a system in the
neighborhood of a point of stable equilibrium. The kinetic energy is
quadratic in the momenta, and the potential energy is expanded in
powers of the position coordinates with the point of equilibrium at the
origin. The lowest term, is therefore a positive definite, quadratic form
of the position coordinates. It can be diagonalized by an appropriate
linear orthogonal transformation, so that the Hamiltonian takes the
form p 2 /2m + mw 2q 2 in each degree of freedom. The additional
q yields the

where H<s> is a homogeneous polynomial of s-th degree in the coordinates p and q.
At the beginning, the polynomials H(s) are functions of the positions
q only; after the first transformation, however, and all the later ones,
the form (14.5) remains the same, but the polynomials H(s) contain
both, momenta and positions. Our aim is to give these polynomials the
simplest form which can be achieved. Birkhoff's idea is to make H(s)
a function of the variables Pk = (p~ + qD/2. This requirement can be
expressed in the form of a Poisson bracket,

If this condition is fulfilled, the partial Hamiltonian l-J(s) is said to be in
its normal form.
The first transformation is designed to do the job for H(3); the second transformation does it for H< 4 > while leaving H( 3 ) unchanged, and
so on. Just as in Section 5.3, the generating function that takes care
of H(s) depends on the new momenta Pk and the old positions qk. In
analogy to (5.6), it is written as

L Pkqk + W )(P, q) ,
n

F(s) =

where W(s) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree s in P and q.
The resulting transformation,

Qk = qk+aw<s>;aPk, Pk = Pk+aw<s);aqk,

(14.8)

does not affect the terms in the Hamiltonian of degree lower than s.
The explicit calculation of the coefficients in W(s>, however, on the
basis of condition (14.6) is not a trivial matter. We will not go into the
computational detail, and point out only that the number of parameters
available in W(s) matches the number of coefficients in n<s> that are
supposed to vanish after the transformation.
As explained in Section 8.4, the above normalization procedure is
equivalent to finding the n new constants of motion Pk = (p'l: + q'l:)/2
in the new coordinates. After transforming these expressions back into
the original coordinates, as many constants of motion for the original
coordinates are established as there are degrees of freedom. By assigning each some fixed value, a corresponding invariant torus in the
original phase space is found.
This method yields good approximations to the invariant tori in
phase space wherever they happen to lie; in addition, it produces some
fictitious invariant tori where the surface of section clearly indicates
chaotic behavior, as shown in Figures 12, 13, and 14. The normalization does not converge in general and has to be truncated. The algebraic manipulations are done on a computer; truncation at the eighth
order is apparently a good stopping point for Hamiltonians of the
Henon-Heiles type. At every order, the transformed Hamiltonian is a
polynomial r(p1 , pz, ... ).
Problems arise when some of the frequencies wk are commensurate,
or nearly so; the procedure has to be modified in a manner that was
first employed by Gustavson in the discussion of the Henon-Heiles
model (cf. Section 8.4 ). Swimm and Delos (1979) also consider a

218

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

system with two degrees of freedom and a third-order coupling term,
but they avoid the difficulty of commensurate frequencies by choosing
the ratio w 1I w 2 = 13/7. This ratio cannot be changed with the help
of canonical transformations. The frequencies are set equal to 0.7 and
1.3, rather than 1.0 and 1.0 as in the Henon-Heiles model (8.4).
In order to appreciate the effect of the third-order term H( 3 l, the
reader has to recall that classical mechanics still allows the choice of a
length scale, or the range of the coupling term, even after the quadratic
terms have been brought into the form (14.5). Since the coupling
range has been set at 1 in the Henon-Heiles model, Planck's constant
has a numerical value that can no longer be scaled to 1. Swimm and
Delos choose the opposite route by setting li = 1, and then writing the
coupling term as
(14.9)
If A and TJ are small enough, the lowest energy levels are very close to

independent harmonic oscillators. The effect of soft chaos in this
Hamiltonian is then felt only in the higher levels; it is the same as
making Planck's constant small, and the coupling parameters A and TJ
of order 1.
The quantization of this system with the help of the EBK scheme
of the preceding section requires that each
(14.10)
Pk = (pi +q~)/2 = (nk + 1/2)/i ,
where the integer nk ~ 0. The 1/2 in addition to the integer nk corresponds to a Maslov index of 2 for each degree of freedom; or equivalently, 2 conjugate points on the trajectory for each turn around the
invariant torus along the (pk. qk) direction; or finally, the 'TT /2 loss of
phase at each classical turning point of the k-th oscillator.
The spectrum of energy levels is, therefore, given by the formula
E(n 1, n2 , ... ) = f((n 1 +1/2)/i, (n 2 + 1/2)/i, ... ) , (14.11)
where r is the Hamiltonian after the normalization and after truncating

method where one degree of freedom after another has to be quantized
according to (14.4). The quantization of the subsequent degree of
freedom depends on the quantum number in the preceding one, and the
number of conjugate points has to be obtained by going back to the
trajectory in the original coordinates.
The final results are remarkable because they show that formula
( 14.11) represents almost the whole spectrum for the (practically)
incommensurate frequencies w 1 = 1.3 and w2 = 0.7 with A = -0.1 and

mechanical levels does not go beyond 0.5% for 82 bound states out
of the 83 levels found by solving Schrodinger's equation. These energy
levels have actually come down from their values in the absence of the
third-order term by some 15%, and yet the errors compared with the
exact quantum-mechanical values amount to less than 0.5%.
The comparison of the exact quantum-mechanical energies with the
ones from the normalized Hamiltonian is not as favorable in the
commensurate case. Some levels are not described by the above
method; but the normalized Hamiltonian still yields a large number of
levels whose energies are in good agreement with some quantummechanical niveau. There is a much higher fraction of such levels than
could be suspected from the volume in classical phase space which is
covered by invariant tori. The conclusion seems inevitable that the
eigenfunctions accommodate themselves to a limited amount of chaos
between the remaining invariant tori. Quantum mechanics is able to
ride over some of the rough spots in classical mechanics, and effectively
to make up its own invariant tori between the real ones which the KAM
theorem provides.
The pseudoinvariant tori in phase space were constructed by algebraic means, under the assumption that the procedure converges. The
original method by Birkhoff, its refinements by Gustavson, and its application by Swimm and Delos used polynomials of increasing order;
but the same idea can be carried out if the perturbation H' of the
integrable Hamiltonian H 0 is a trigonometric function of the angular
variables as (3.5).
The first canonical transformation is then exactly given by the
method in Section 5.3, except that the explicit time-dependence is
dropped, i.e., m0 = 0. The generating function Win (5.6) now has a
sum over all the relevant multiples (m 1, m 2 , m3 ), each given by the
formulas (5.7) and (5.8) with the resonance denominators. The calculation of the new Hamiltonian is the difficult part: its perturbing part
is smaller by one order than before the transformation. The whole
procedure can be repeated again, until the truncation seems reasonable.
This alternative route was first suggested by Chapman, Garret, and
Miller (1976) who tried it on the combination of the independent
oscillators (14.5) with the perturbation (14.9). Jaffe and Reinhardt
( 1979) succeeded in accelerating the convergence, using Newton's idea
for solving equations numerically, which was mentioned in Section 9.6
to explain the KAM theorem. Again most of the quantum-mechanical
energy levels are well approximated, as if the system were integrable.

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

14.4 The Frequency Analysis of a Classical Trajectory
The projection of the trajectories into position space is sometimes
found to yield complicated patterns, with all kinds of caustics that may
form sharp tips, as in Figure 31. It is then not easy to find contours C
of a simple shape so as to apply the EKB conditions (14.4). Nevertheless, the structure of the tori in phase space stays the same for a
certain range of energy, and appropriate search procedures can be
worked out. A survey of these endeavors was given by Noid,
Koszykowski, and Marcus (1981).
The tori satisfying the quantization conditions do not generally
carry closed trajectories. A 'trajectory closure method' is used to
complete the contour C. Most of C consists of the numerical trajectory, which is eventually closed by a short straight link when it passes
through the neighborhood of its starting point. An ordinary, but carefully chosen, surface of section gives the second contour needed to
quantize a system with two degrees of freedom. This method gives
good eigenvalues wherever there are invariant tori in phase space; but
no energy levels corresponding to the chaotic area are obtained in this
way.
An alternative criterion for integrability is found in the multiperiodic nature of the trajectories. Since the coordinates of a trajectory
can be expanded in a Fourier series like (3.4 ), with as many frequencies
as degrees of freedom, it suffices to find these frequencies directly from
a numerical integration. The classical quantization rules (14.4) can
then be applied directly, without pinning down the corresponding invariant tori. Such an analysis does not require a surface of section, and
is, therefore, applicable to systems with more than two degrees of
freedom.
This idea was explored by Marcus and coworkers (cf. N oid et al
1977 and 1980), and some interesting examples were treated numerically (cf. Dumont and Brumer 1988). Since these investigations are
closely tied in with more general applications of classical trajectories,
we shall discuss their basis in some detail. Rice (1944, 1945) wrote
an exceptionally clear and simple exposition of these ideas in the Bell
System Technical Journal under the title "Mathematical Analysis of
Random Noise"; we will only give the bare outline of the relevant results.
In this section, we are interested in making the Fourier analysis of
a particular trajectory; but more generally, we will get the power spectrum I(w) of the autocorrelation function C(T) = < x(t)x(t + T) >.
The function x(t) stands for some dynamical variable, such as a position coordinate q(t), or a momentum coordinate p(t), or a dipole mo-

t. The averaging operation < ... > refers to either one or possibly both
of the following features: (i) the existence of a whole ensemble of
equivalent dynamical variables, all participating equally in the measurement to be carried out and characterized by some external parameters like different initial conditions; (ii) the same particular system, but
measured at different times. In the latter case we define

When applying these definitions to a trajectory calculation, it helps
to make some additional assumptions: the correlation function C( T) is
stationary, i.e., < x(O)x(T) > = < x(t)x(t + T) > for any value of
t; the dynamical variable x(t) is real, so that C( T) is an even function
oft, i.e., C( - T) = C( T). The power spectrum I(w) is then a real and
non-negative function of w. It is calculated in practice as the limit,

This expression justifies the name 'power spectrum': if a signal is

There are sharp lines at the fundamental frequencies w1, ... , wm and all
their linear combinations with integer coefficients k 1, ... , kn. Each line
corresponds to a transition from one energy level to another, if there
is some external stimulation. The strength of each line is related to a
physical process and involves the coordinate x(t), such as p(t) in
( 14.14). It is given by the absolute square of its coefficient in the
Fourier expansion (3.4) or (3.5). Figure 32 shows such a spectrum for
an integrable system with three degrees of freedom, one of the few in-

stances so far where a system with more than two degrees of freedom
has been studied in this context.
The contrast between the power spectra for integrable and for
ergodic trajectories is striking. Instead of the sharp peaks, there appear
broadened lines which cannot be narrowed by extending the time of
integration Tin (14.13). Nevertheless, the spectrum has a complicated
structure, as shown in the example of Figure 33. Different trajectories
of the same energy, but belonging to separate ergodic regions in phase
space, lead to very different-looking spectra. Their relation to the
corresponding parts in the surface of section has not been investigated
in detail as yet.
How can we extract classical approximations to the energy levels
of a conservative system from the frequency spectrum of the integrable
trajectories in a conservative system? If we try many initial conditions,
we will eventually get a function E(w 1, .... , wn) which gives the energy
of the trajectory whose frequencies are found to be w 1, ... , wn. This
function is the dual of H(/ 1, ... , In) in Sections 3.3 and 6.2, which gives
the energy in function of the action integrals h, ... , In, and whose derivatives are the frequencies according to (3.3 ), i.e., wk = iJHI iJh.
As discussed in Section 14.2, the energy levels are given by the discrete
values H((n 1 + 112)1!, (n 2 + 112)1!, ... ) in terms of the quantum numbers (nJ, n2, ... ).
The procedure for finding H(/1, ... , In) from E(wJ, .... , wn) goes
through the following steps: consider the/'s as functions of thew's and
show that the mixed derivatives are equal, i.e., aidiJw2 = iJhliJw 1,
and so on; therefore, a function F(w 1, .... , wn) exists, such that
h = aFI awk. Now the usual argument for Legendre transforms
shows that the condition

holds; the first equality determines F(w) when E(w) is known, while
the second equality tells us how to calculate H(l).
The transition from frequencies to actions requires, therefore, the
solution F(w) of the first-order linear partial differential equation
(14.15). The standard methods show that (14.15) determines Fin
frequency space only along straight lines through the origin. An initial
value is needed at some point along each straight line in order to fix the
value ofF uniquely. Equivalently, any two solutions of (14.15) differ
by a solution /(w 1, .•• , wn) of the same equation, but with 0 on the
right-hand side. This last condition says simply that f is any homogeneous function of first degree in the variables (w ~. ... , wn), such as
[wt + ... + w~]I1 2 •
The function E(w) alone, therefore, does not determine the function

H(I) uniquely.

For each relevant direction in frequency space, the
values of the corresponding actions I have to be obtained independently. A limited knowledge of the invariant tori is required after all,
although only on a submanifold of codimension 1.
Marcus and coworkers circumvent this problem. They choose initial conditions for the perturbed system which satisfy the conditions
(14.4) for the action integrals with f3i = 2 in the unperturbed system.
The action integrals I are thereby fixed already for the perturbed sys-

tern. This shortcut is valid because the frequencies w change only very
slowly with the values of the action /. The transition frequencies, for
the same Henon-Heiles like system (14.9) as in the preceding section,
are then found to be in excellent agreement with the exact quantum
calculations.

14.5 The Adiabatic Principle
Even before Bohr quantized the hydrogen atom, Ehrenfest had recognized the importance of the action integral, fp dq. Klein (1970) discusses this development in his biography of Ehrenfest. According to
Boltzmann's statistical mechanics, the probability for a mechanical
system to be somewhere in phase space is proportional to the volume
in phase space. The quantization conditions have to be chosen such
that reversible, adiabatic changes in the dynamical system bring the
quantized energies back to their original values upon the completion
of a closed cycle.
The action integral for a periodic orbit satisfies this requirement as
can be seen from the harmonic oscillator. If the spring constant is
varied very slowly, i.e., it takes many oscillations for the frequency to
change substantially, the ratio E/ w is found to remain constant. Since
the energy E is twice the kinetic energy, and w = 2'1T IT in terms of the
period T, one finds indeed that E/ w = fp dq/2'1T = multiple of It as
claimed by Planck.
This argument is valid provided the classical trajectories are periodic
orbits, as in the harmonic oscillator and the Kepler problem. Moreover, they have to preserve this periodicity as the parameters in the
problem, like the spring constant, are changed. These conditions can
be generalized to include integrable systems that keep their invariant
tori in phase space when the parameters are modified. Certain natural
precautions have to be taken to avoid any of the frequencies going
through zero, as will be explained below. In spite of these severe restrictions, however, the adiabatic principle has some limited validity,
and can be put to good use, even when the dynamical system becomes
chaotic while changing its parameters (cf. Reinhardt and Dana 1987).
In order to appreciate the adiabatic invariance of the action integral,
a short return to Chapter 7 is necessary. If any closed loop C in phase
space is chosen, and a trajectory is started at each point of C by integrating the equations of motion for some (possibly time-dependent)
Hamiltonian H, a whole sequence of loops C(t) is obtained. The integral f pdq taken over C(t) was shown in Section 7.1 to keep its initial

14.5 The Adiabatic Principle

225

value. The proof of this result is straightforward and very general. By
contrast, the adiabatic principle, although somewhat reminiscent,
makes a different claim, and its proof depends on many subtle assumptions (for a careful discussion, cf. Jaffe and Watanabe 1988).
Consider a time-independent Hamiltonian H(p, q, .\) which depends on a parameter .\, and which remains integrable for all values of
.\ in a certain fixed interval, say from 0 to 1. Let us now replace .\ in
the H(p, q, .\) by a monotonically increasing function of time, called
.\(t) for simplicity's sake. The Hamiltonian has now become timedependent, and one can apply the construction of the preceding paragraph; whatever the function .\(t), e.g., in (14.9), the value of fpdq
over C(t) remains the same.
Since H(p, q, 0) is integrable, it is natural to choose the initial loop
C(O) to lie on one of its invariant tori. Let us now follow the fate of
the contour C(t) as the trajectories in phase space are calculated on the
basis of the Hamiltonian H(p, q, .\(!)). Does the loop C(l) lie on an
invariant torus of the Hamiltonian H(p, q, 1) ? No, unless the function
.\(t) increases infinitely slowly from 0 to 1, or equivalently, the steady
increase from 0 to 1 is stretched over a very long time T. This time T
has to be great with respect to any natural time scale of the timeindependent Hamiltonian H(p, q, .\) at a fixed value of 0 ~ A ~ 1.
In the further discussion, we follow Reinhardt and Gillilan ( 1986)
who were among the first to exploit this idea in order to obtain the
energy levels of a dynamical system with the help of the adiabatic
principle. Their starting Hamiltonian H(p, q, 0) has its degrees of
freedom fully separated, e.g., by setting the third and higher-order
terms in (14.5) equal to 0, or equivalently, A = 0 in (14.9). The choice
of C(O) is then obvious, corresponding to a periodic orbit in one of the
degrees of freedom, with the value of fpdq = (v + 1/2)11. As A increases to the end of its interval, the quantum number v remains the
same; but the energy can change significantly and yields the classical
aproximation to a quanta! energy.
The energy for an individual trajectory can vary quite drastically,
and non-monotonically , if the time T for the adiabatic transition is not
extremely long. The simultaneous integration over many trajectories,
all starting on the same contour C(O), leads to an average energy E(t)
with a more bounded variation. The whole process. is sped up if the
trajectories are sampled on the whole initial torus, which is then characterized by two quantum numbers. The resulting average E(t) varies
monotonically; the accuracy of the resulting approximate energy level
can be judged by calculating the root-mean-square deviation from the
mean of the energies for the individual trajectories. If it is substantially
smaller than the energy difference between neighboring levels, the

226

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

comparison with the exact quantum-mechanical computations is very
good.
The validity of the adiabatic principle has been extensively studied
in classical mechanics. Recent work, which includes some detailed
numerical investigations, was done by Dana and Reinhardt ( 1987) on
the standard map, and by Brown, Ott, and Grebogi (1987) on billiards
with slowly moving walls as well as anharmonic oscillators. The reader
will find there many references to earlier work.
The application to quasiclassical quantization was first made by
Skodje, Borondo, and Reinhardt (1985); we can only hint at some of
their results, and encourage the reader to study their fascinating paper.
A critical aspect is again related to the occurrence of resonances as the
parameters of the Hamiltonian are changed. As we saw in Chapter 9,
the typical resonance generates a chain of islands in the surface of
section with a separatrix between them, exactly as in the phase space
of the pendulum. The motion near the separatrix is arbitrarily slow; if
the loop C(t) and the corresponding torus try to cross the separatrix,
the variation of the parameter A.(t) will always be too fast, and the
adiabatic principle breaks down. Such a disaster can be avoided by
choosing an initial torus, or an initial Hamiltonian, so that no crossing
of resonances occurs. Obviously, such a strategy requires a good
understanding of the dynamical system ahead of time; otherwise the
theory of Cary and Skodje (1989) has to be used.
Although all these arguments are limited to integrable systems, the
numerical calculations were carried out for the Henon-Heiles type
model with a slowly increasing A.(t) in the coupling term (14.9), starting
at 0 and going to the value chosen by Marcus and coworkers in their
Fourier analysis of trajectories (cf. the preceding section). About half
of phase space becomes chaotic eventually, but many energy levels
which lie clearly in the ergodic region are still obtained with good acThe agreement with the exact quantum-mechanical
curacy.
eigenvalues seems directly related to the root-mean-square deviation
of the energy E(t) for the individual trajectories.
Lest the reader think that complete agreement can be achieved by
taking a large sample or a sufficiently slow variation, the numerical
experience shows otherwise. The deviation can be reduced to some
extent, but as the time for the adiabatic transition is lengthened beyond
some critical interval, the deviation starts increasing again.
Reinhardt (1985) proposes an interpretation for this behavior in
terms of vague tori, or equivalently, regions of phase space which are
not quite separated any longer by a KAM torus. Indeed, as we saw in
Chapter 9, when a last surviving torus with an irrational frequency ratio
vanishes, the trajectories cross the ancient boundary in phase space

14.5 The Adiabatic Principle

227

only rather reluctantly. It now appears that such a temporary reprieve
in the classical motion is sufficient for a quantum-mechanical wave
function to settle down and define an energy level.

14.6 Tunneling Between Tori
The phase space of the ordinary pendulum foliates itself into a set of
nested loops up to a separatrix which divides the oscillatory and the
rotational motions; the latter form a layered structure, and the energy
increases monotonically as one goes further away from the stable
equilibrium. If the potential energy has two distinct minima, however,
as in a double well, the phase space foliates itself into two sets of nested
loops. The separatrix has the energy of the local maximum between the
two minima. As the energy increases, one finds again the layered
structure of a single kind of motion, namely an oscillation which runs
over both minima, between the outside walls of the potential.
The same pictures arise in the surface of section for a system with
two degrees of freedom, e.g., in the Henon-Heiles model as shown in
Figures 12 and 13. The various constructions in the preceding sections
always applied to a single torus and its immediate surroundings. In
particular, Keller's wave function is tied to one torus that satisfies the
quantization conditions (14.4). Therefore, it may happen that two
different tori end up with the same energy, or at least with an energy
difference small compared to the difference with other levels.
Quantum mechanics proceeds to 'split' this degeneracy by making
up eigenstates with significant amplitude in both wells, or more generally, on both tori. Nothing of the sort can happen in classical mechanics because there is no trajectory connecting the two troughs in the
double well if the energy is insufficient to overcome the local maximum. Similarly, there is no classical passage from one torus to another
of the same energy, although the situation is now less transparent since
the obstacle is not simply a wall too high to climb with the available
energy. As we saw already in the Kepler problem (cf. Section 2.5),
when the particle starts in some given position q' with a fixed total energy E , it is still unable to reach all the other positions q whose potential energy V(q) :5 E ; only the positions inside the critical ellipse are
dynamically accessible.
A particle is said to tunnel quantum-mechanically from one well to
the other in one dimension; this effect is discussed in most textbooks,
although not in its full generality. If the potential has a simple rectangular shape, the wave functions can be written down in terms of trig-

228

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

onometric and exponential functions. When the shape is arbitrary,
however, although there is still only one degree of freedom, the way to
proceed is not obvious because Kramers' connection formulas between
the classically allowed and the classically forbidden region do not give
a unique prescription.
A systematic start on this general problem could be made as in
Chapter 13 with the help of Feynman's path integral; but the tunneling
problem is defined only if a particular value of the energy is given,
whereas the path integral exists only as a function of time. Indeed, the
transition across the (static or dynamical) barrier is in general possible
classically for sufficiently short times, at a price in energy. The integral
(12.27) of the propagator Kover time, in order to get Green's function
G, can not be performed by stationary phase for a sufficiently low energy to require tunneling. It is then not clear how the exponential decay of the probability amplitude comes about (cf. Freed 1972), unless
the timet is allowed to have a negative imaginary part (cf. among others, Weiss and Haeffner 1983).
Conventional wisdom now takes the expression (12.28) for the
classical Green's function, and inserts the integral (2.6) for the action
integral, with the endpoints q' and q" at the boundary of the classically
allowed region. Since V(q) ;::: E, however, the integrand vE- V(q)
becomes imaginary; its sign is chosen in agreement with E having a
small positive imaginary part i e, so that the phase factor exp[
iS(q"q'E)/Ii] in (12.28) becomes exponentially small. The wave
function in the forbidden region is also assumed to decay in this exponential fashion, and the splitting of the degeneracy is, therefore, proportional to the 'overlap',

(14.16)

q

Whereas there is little doubt about this expression for tunneling in
one dimension, the analogous problem in two or more dimensions requires a more detailed investigation. Wilkinson (1986), as well as
Wilkinson and Hannay (1987) have presented a particularly convincing way to proceed, which seems applicable in many different problems. They start from an identity due to Herring (1962): consider a
typical tunneling situation which results in a near-degeneracy between
two states with the wave functions cf>a and cf>b· Let the surface ~ divide
the two regions in position space where the two wells are located, so
that both wave functions are very small near ~. Since both wave
functions are eigenfunctions of the Schrodinger operator, Green's
identity can be applied to yield the exact equation,

14.6 Tunneling Between Tori

229

where the volume Vis either one of the half spaces which are created
by ~, and the gradient points toward the outside.
The tunneling situation now gives the two nearly degenerate wave
functions the following special features: both are very small near the
dividing surface ~. Their main amplitudes are equally distributed between the two halves of space. They differ because they have different
relative signs in the two halves. For definiteness sake, cf>a has the same
sign, while the prevailing signs of cf>b are opposite in the two halves.
Except for the region near ~. and the obvious differences in overall
sign, cf>a and cf>b are very closely the same in each half. Therefore, the
volume-integral in (14.17) is very close to l/2, and
Ea- Eb = ±t?

~

d'i. (cpa gradcpb- cpb gradcpa),

(14.18)

which is already Herring's formula. In order to use (14.18), it is
enough to know the wave functions cp in only one-half of the position
space, i.e., comprising only one of the two wells, or one of the two tori.
This one-half of a wave function depends, of course, on the whole potential, as we shall see immediately.
The basic idea is to solve the equations (14.3) in the region where
E < V(q) by assuming the action function S(q) to be purely imaginary.
The wave function cp(q) in (14.2) has then a real exponent which can
be chosen so that cp becomes exponentially small near the dividing
surface ~. in complete analogy to (14.16). Wilkinson and Hannay
phrase the whole argument more carefully by falling back on Green's
function in the form (12.28) where the action integral can be written
as in (2.6). If the energy E under the square root is interpreted as a
complex number with a small positive imaginary part e, so that
E-+E + ie as we had already done in (12.27) and (13.10), then the
integral (2.6) also acquires a positive imaginary part, and (14.16) is
quite consistent.
Since the wave function on the dividing surface ~ is now known, at
least by a classical approximation, the integral over ~ can be calculated
by the method of steepest descent. Thus, one has to find a trajectory
which goes from one well to the other, or from one torus to the other,
with the potential - V(q). In the case of the groundstate for the
hydrogen-molecule ion, this trajectory coincides with the straight line
connecting the two protons because of the symmetry of the two tori
involved (Cf. Section 3.4). In general, however, there is no symmetry
to indicate the best tunneling trajectory.

230

The Quantization of Integrable Systems

When the chemists calculate reaction rates where the system does
not have enough energy to overcome the potential barrier classically,
the trajectory has to be found by a numerical computation (cf. the work
of Garret and Truhlar with their collaborators, 1983 and 1985). The
conditions to be satisfied are quite different from the usual trajectory
calculations; instead of known initial position and momentum, the initial and the final positions have to be located on the boundary of the
classically forbidden region; but their exact locations and initial directions have to be found from the condition of minimal action. The
same difficulty arises in phase space, when there is tunneling between
different tori (cf. among the many efforts in this direction, Auerbach
and Kivelson (1984), and the same authors with Nicole (1985), as well
as Huang, Feuchtwang, Cutler, and Kazes 1989).

CHAPTER 15

Wave Functions in
Classically Chaotic Systems

The state of a quantum-mechanical system at any fixed time t is
uniquely described by its complex-valued wave function 1/;(q, t), where
q represents one-half of a canonically conjugate coordinate system
(p, q). Besides being square-integrable, and satisfying certain boundary conditions which depend on the problem at hand, the wave function
1/;(q, t) at a fixed time t is subject to few restrictions. Of course, when
the time is allowed to vary, 1/; has to satisfy Schrodinger's equation
(13.1) with a well-defined real-valued potential V(q, t).
Any symptoms of chaos are, therefore, found in the time dependence of tf;(q, t). Wave functions of a fixed frequency w = E/ll, the
usual eigenfunctions 1/;(q, t) = cp(q) exp( -iwt) of the stationary
Schrodinger equation (13.6), can be expected to display whatever
chaotic features can show up in the framework of quantum mechanics.
It is not clear what those features could be, however, because the
eigenfunctions cp(q) are smooth in the strong mathematical sense of
being analytic, i.e., expandable in a convergent power series with respect to the coordinates q. Also, the states of low energy E are uninteresting since they have few distinguishing chara1~teristics such as
maxima and minima, or complicated nodal lines where cp(q) = 0.
Chaos in quantum mechanics, if there is any to be seen in the
eigenstates, will show up only in the highly excited states. They bring
us back to the limit of small Planck's quantum ll, and thus to the connection with classical mechanics. Since wave functions in general are

232

Wave Functions in Classically Chaotic Systems

hard to measure, and the highly excited ones are hard to calculate, the
topic of this chapter is still wide open.
Many different approaches have been tried, nevertheless, some of
which will be discussed here. No hard and fast rules are known so far;
the numerical results and their interpretation have not yielded any
simple criteria for the presence or absence of chaos. But they have led
everybody to be keenly aware of what can be learned from looking at
a wave function. The many manifestations of quantum mechanics have
become much better appreciated, as well as the possibility of viewing
the same situation from different vantage points (cf. the recent review
of Eckhardt 1988).

15.1 The Eigenstates of an Integrable System
Since the Hamiltonian operator Hop in (13 .11) is both linear and real,
as long as there is no magnetic field, its eigenfunctions can always be
made real-valued, and can be plotted without difficulty. Can we tell
whether the system is integrable or not from looking at the plot?
Pechukas ( 1972) addressed this issue and proposed a test which goes
back to earlier work of Miller and Good (1953); as pointed out above,
such a test is necessarily restricted to highly excited states.
An integrable system behaves very much like a separable one; in
particular, the patterns of nodal lines where the wave function vanishes
are expected to be similar. With n degrees of freedom, there are n
families of (finitely many) roughly parallel (n - 1)- dimensional nodal
surfaces where each surface intersects all the ones from the other families transversely. In two degrees of freedom, the nodal pattern looks
like a distorted chess board. The quantum numbers are the numbers
of nodal surfaces in each family.
As a simple example of a separable system, take two decoupled
harmonic oscillators whose frequencies are not commensurate; their
position coordinates are x and y. The eigenstates are products

eigenfunctions that can be expressed in the form

where (x, y) = T(t 17) is a one-to-one, sufficiently smooth transformation of the coordinates, independent of the quantum numbers f.L and
v.

15.1 The Eigenstates of an Integrable System

233

This transformation T satisfies a set of conditions that can be interpreted in terms of the Hamilton-Jacobi first-order partial differential equation (2.8) or (14.3). This idea, therefore, brings us back to
Keller's construction in Section 14.2. The simple recipe above has to
be adjusted when the nodal pattern in the position coordinates becomes
more complicated, because the invariant tori in phase space have nontrivial projections, as in Figure 31.
Eigenstates of an integrable quantum system can probably be constructed with the help of some of the other methods that worked for
classical integrable systems. Foremost among them are the canonical
transformations, in particular the Birkhoff-Gustavson normalization
scheme of Section 14.3. A start in this direction was made by Thomas
(1942), and then by Eckhardt (1986); everything seems indeed set up
for the generalization to quantum mechanics. The quantities Pk in
Section 14.3 become the quantum number for the k-th oscillator as
shown in (14.10).
More specifically, already Birkhoff used the complex quantities
ak = (qk + ipk)!/2 , ak+ = (qk - iPk)l/2 , (15.2)
which now become the lowering and raising operators for the k-th
oscillator. The classical procedures used the Poisson brackets to define
the conditions for the generating functions W of the canonical transformations; now, the commutator with the Hamiltonian appears for
unitary operators W, and their construction is entirely similar.
At the end, the starting Hamiltonian becomes a polynomial in the
'occcupation' numbers Nk = a;t ak. ·and the formula ( 14.11) follows.
There are corrections in li 2 , however, which can not be obtained by the
semiclassical approach of Section 14.3. By transforming back to the
original coordinates, the corresponding eigenfunctions can be calculated. It would be of great interest to see where they are located, and
how they are distributed in phase space; for this last notion, one needs
the Wigner function which is the main topic Section 15.4.

15.2 Patterns of Nodal Lines
The simple checkerboard for regions of positive and negative values
of the eigenfunction cp(x, y) gets destroyed when the system ceases to
be integrable. The original arrangement may still be recognizable, but
the lines separating black (positive) and white (negative) regions do
not intersect any longer. Typically, these lines are long compared with
the size of the available space, forming an involved zigzag curve; either
they go from one boundary to another, or they are closed loops. Before

234

Wave Functions in Classically Chaotic Systems

trying to interpret this phenomenon, two preliminary remarks have to
be kept in mind.
A theorem by Uhlenbeck (1976) states that it is a generic property
of eigenfunctions to have non-intersecting nodal lines. The argument
goes roughly as follows: at the point where two nodal lines intersect,
not only does the wave function vanish, cp(x, y) = 0, but so does its
gradient because the partial derivatives are zero along each nodal line.
Therefore, three simultaneous conditions have to be imposed on cp at
the nodal intersection; but whereas a single condition defines a line in
the (x,y) plane, and a double condition defines an isolated point, a triple condition cannot be satisfied in general.
It is very easy to destroy a nice checkerboard pattern, simply by
adding two wave functions each of which all by itself produces such a
pattern. As an example, from the first volume of Courant and Hilbert
(1931 p. 396, 1953 p. 451), take the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian
in the unit-square with the Dirichlet boundary condition, i.e., cp = 0.
The two functions,
¢ 1 = sin(k7Tx) sin(£7Ty) , ¢ 2 = sin(£7Tx) sin(k7Ty) , (15.3)
with 0 < k < f, belong to the same eigenvalue, and each has a perfect
checkerboard-like pattern of positive and negative values. And yet the
sum ¢ 1 + (1 + e)¢ 2 with c #; 0 does not have a single crossing of
nodal lines.
Stratt, Handy, and Miller (1979) made a very thorough investigation of the nodal pattern for a variant of the Contopoulos
Hamiltonian (cf. Chapter 8), due to Barbanis. Two harmonic
oscillators of different frequencies are coupled by a third-order term
axy 2 , where a is chosen such as to allow for about 135 eigenstates that
are confined to the potential well near the origin. These eigenstates are
represented as linear combinations of 420 products of Hermite functions, each similar to the first example in the preceding section.
The eigenstates are put into three classes, called regular, uncertain,
and ergodic, simply by visual inspection; an example from each class
is given in Figure 34. There is clearly room for personal bias; but the
authors try to compare their assignments with other symptoms of
chaos. We will only mention the spectral analysis of Section 14.4
where x(t) in (14.13) now is the electric dipole-moment, and the averaging operation< ... >is the quantum-mechanical expectation value.
The averaged quantum-numbers are defined as
nx + 1/2 = mwx < x 2 > /ti, ny + 1/2 = mwy < y 2 > /ti .(15.4)
Uncertain and ergodic states cannot be associated with weakly perturbed harmonic oscillators; on the basis of their averaged quantum-

numbers, both of their degrees of freedom carry about the same
energy, indicating an effective resonance.
Stratt, Handy, and Miller also study the precise make-up of their
eigenstates in terms of the underlying basis of 420 decoupled harmonic
oscillator states. Nordholm and Rice (1974) had proposed that an
ergodic eigenstate requires a wide distribution of uncoupled states in
its representation, whereas a regular eigenstate is characterized by one,
or at worst only a few, principal contributors. This argument was
called into question, however, because it depends on the choice of the
basis for the uncoupled states, which can be more or less appropriate
to the particular Hamiltonian at hand.
A better method seems, therefore, to ask for the 'most natural orbitals' to represent a particular eigenstate IP(x, y). If we started with

236

Wave Functions in Classically Chaotic Systems

the basis of functions </>k(x) xe(y) where the indices k, f are allowed
to vary in certain restricted intervals, then we have the expansion
<I>(x, y) = L
k

Ckf <l>k(x) xe(y) .

(15.6)

where the matrices U and V are the matrices of eigenvectors for C c+
and c+ C. The eigenvalues Aj of these last matrices can be interpreted
as the 'occupation numbers' for <I>(x,y) = ~(>...j)l/2 <I>j(x) Zj(y).
The results of this analysis for the eigenstates of the Barbanis potential are consistent with the original purpose of the calculation; but
they do not yield a very striking criterion for distinguishing the ergodic
and the regular states. Again, we find ourselves in front of a useful
hint, not a sharp characterization. Moreover, the method of the 'most
natural orbitals' depends on the choice of the coordinate system, in this
case the Cartesian (x,y).
A related analysis was carried out on the stadium, a Hamiltonian
system that was proved by Bunimovich (1974 and 1979) to be strongly
chaotic. It has a Kolmogoroff entropy, and its trajectories are unstable
(cf. end of Section 10.3). It also has a simple geometrical structure: a
domain is bounded in the y-direction by two parallel straight segments
Ix I ~ a at y = ± R, and in the x-direction by two half-circles of radius
R centered in x = ± a , y = 0; the potential is 0 inside the domain, and
+ oo outside. A classical particle makes a specular reflection on the
walls of the stadium, while a wave function has to vanish there.
McDonald and Kaufmann ( 1979) were the first to calculate
eigenstates for the stadium, and plot their nodal patterns. Their preliminary results appeared before the above work on the Barbanis potential, and left a strong impression on the aficionados of chaos in
quantum mechanics. In particular, Figure 35 gives a vivid picture of a
disorderly wave function, something that nobody had really seen or
imagined before.
Many more such pictures can be found in
McDonald's Ph.D. thesis (1983), including the perspective drawings
for the absolute values squared of the same eigenstates, like Figure 36;
some of these were finally published by McDonald and Kaufmann
(1988).
The stadium will come up several times later on; but at this point, a
note of caution should be inserted about its ergodicity. The shape of
the stadium is such as to allow for at least one class of almost stable
trajectories; these correspond to the particle bouncing back and forth

for a long time between the two parallel segments of the boundary.
Correspondingly, an almost plane wave can slush back and forth in the
y-direction; thus, in spite of the 'mathematically proven' classical
chaos, there is a good fraction of regular eigenstates. They were constructed by Bai, Hose, Stefanski, and Taylor (1985) using what they
called the 'Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic mechanism'.
The potential for the stadium is formally defined as a function
V(x ; y) of y for a given value of the parameter x. The eigenstates for
the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation in the y-direction at some
fixed value of x are easy to obtain, because V(x ; y) = 0 for
- Yo(x) < y < Yo(x), and V(y; x) = + oo for iy I> Yo(x). The function y 0 (x) describes the boundary of the stadium in the upper halfplane; let F 11 (x) be the n-th eigenvalue with the eigenfunction
¢ 11 (x ; y), both of which depend on the parameter x.
True to the Born-Oppenheimer philosophy, the one-dimensional
Schrodinger equation in the x-direction with the potential energy
F 11 (x) is now solved to yield the energy £ 111 with the eigenfunction
Xni(x). The total wave function for the stadium, therefore, becomes
<I>nj(x,y) = Xni(x)¢ 11 (X; y) with the energy EnJ· Figure 37 compares
<I>ni for n = 22 and j = 2 with the exact numerical wave function.
About 10% of the exact wave functions have this quasiregular structure.

15.3 Wave-Packet Dynamics
Wave functions with minimum uncertainty !1p !1q are Gaussians
both in position and in momentum space. Such functions are convenient as a basis from which to build many-particle correlated wave
functions for complicated atoms and molecules, because overlap integrals and interaction matrix elements can be worked out algebraically.
Therefore, the quantum chemists have developed the art of using
Gaussian wave functions, even though atomic wave functions decay
rather like a simple exponential with the distance from the nucleus.
Heller (197 5) proposed a new application for Gaussians as a basis
for constructing wave functions. He thought of a classical trajectory
in phase space where the Hamiltonian in the immediate neighborhood
of the moving point p 1 , q1 at a given instant of time t can be expanded
in powers of (p - p 1) and (q- q1) to second order, just as in a harmonic
oscillator. The wave function then becomes

where a 1 is a complex symmetric matrix in as many rows and columns
as degrees of freedom, and y 1 is a complex phase. The expectation
values for the position and the momentum are simply < p > = p 1 and
< q > = q1; the matrix a 1 gives the spread of the wave packet which is
related to the approximate shape of the Hamiltonian near (p1 , qr). The
complex phase y 1 provides the necessary normalization, as well as the
crucial phase angle.

The Hamilton-Jacobi equations of motion have been amplified to include the spreading Gaussian and its phase.
The second half of the last formula is of special interest: its righthand side has an imaginary term iti trace(a 1), which serves to normalize
the Gaussian, and a real part which fixes the change in phase angle.
The rate of change is nothing but the classical Lagrangian in agreement
with (2.1). Heller's scheme is, therefore, a generalization of the Van
Vleck formula (12.20). Notice that the spread a of the wave packet
can be kept real, if it started out that way; but by making it partly im-

240

Wave Functions in Classically Chaotic Systems

aginary, the local phase with respect to q can be made to change at a
non-uniform rate, as indeed the zeros of an excited harmonic-oscillator
wave-function do not come in regular intervals. As in (12.25) for Van
Vleck's formula, the wave packets (15.7) obeying the conditions
(15. 9) can be superimposed to yield competing contributions from
different classical trajectories.
The dynamics of wave packets has been applied and modified in
various ways; the reader has to look up the original papers for the details, e.g., Huber, Heller, and Littlejohn (1988) go into a complex valued phase space. Davis and Heller (1979) calculated the spectrum for
the Henon-Heiles model; but rather than starting from a large base of
oscillator wave-functions as was the usual method for obtaining 'exact
eigenstates', they placed a set of Gaussians like (15.7) into judiciously
chosen locations in four-dimensional phase space, and adjusted their
parameters to the local potential. Figure 38 shows the choice of the
locations for position space, and an approximate eigenfunction for an
excited state from such a calculation. Taking into account classical
considerations obviously helps in simplifying the numerical task, even
when the classical Hamiltonian promises chaotic behavior.
The original idea of spreading a Gaussian like (15.7) along a classical
trajectory was implemented by the same authors (Davis and Heller
1981), again in the Henon-Heiles model, but this time in the integrable
region. After the appropriate torus for a particular quantum state had
been found, the corresponding wave function was obtained. Theresulting pictures of highly excited, but still integrable states are very
impressive, e.g., Figure 39. These figures show some unexpected distributions of the amplitude, and prove that the method of wave-packet
dynamics leads to the subtle interference effects which are the essence
of quantum mechanics.
The frequency analysis of a classical trajectory in Section 14.4 was
carried out by Davis, Stechel, and Heller (1980) for a wave packet
(15.7) traveling according as (15.9), using again the Henon-Heiles
model for energies in the transition region between integrable and
chaotic behavior. The dynamical variable x(t) to define the correlation
function (14.12) is the overlap between the starting wave function
-.f!(q, 0) and the running -.f!(q, t), so that x(t) = f dq -.f!+(q, 0)-.f!(q, t).
Figure 40 shows the two starting wave functions in the surface of section, while Fippres 41 and 42 give both the correlation function
C(t) = Ix(t) I and the energy spectrum I(w). In the author's words,
the difference is profound; but Brumer and Shapiro (1980) see no difference in a similar calculation; for further studies along these lines cf.
Feit and Fleck (1984).

[from Davis and Heller (1979)].

Other investigations of this kind have been reported, usually with
the help of different methods and trying out other dynamical systems
such as the coupled-rotator model of Feingold and Peres (1985).
While everybody now agrees on the most basic features, there is no
detailed explanation for curves such as Figures 41 and 42. One would
like to find some categories for frequency spectra, so that the traveling
wave packets could be classified and related to the Hamiltonian which
generated them. Such a thorough understanding, however, seems a
distant goal at this time, offering a great opportunity for the reader.

15.4 Wigner's Distribution Function in Phase Space
Statistical mechanics studies large ensembles of identilcal particles that
interact with one another such as in a gas or a liquid. The main tool is
the probability in phase space, f(p, q, t) dnp dnq; it indicates the likelihood for a typical particle to have its momentum in the small volume
dnp near p and its position in the small volume dnq near q. The distribution f(p, q, t) satisfies Boltzmann's equation, a first-order partial differential equation which expresses Liouville's theorem on the invariant
volume of phase space (cf. Section 7.2); the interac1tion between the

integrable region, on the left, and the same state calculated from the standard
diagonalization over a large base of oscillator wave-functions, on the right;
this state happens to show the worst discrepancies [from Davis and Heller
(1981)].

particles is usually described by a simple collision probability, which
makes this equation in general non-linear, and, therefore, very hard to
solve. Nevertheless, Boltzmann's equation is absolutely fundamental;
its author deduced from it an expression for the entropy of the ensemble, and showed that it increases with time. Boltzmann's formula for
the entropy is none other than (1 0.1) which is used for the metric
entropy of a dynamical system.
Wigner (1932) tried to derive the quantum-mechanical corrections
to Boltzmann's equation. His expression for the distributionf(p, q, t)
in terms of the wave function lf;(q, t) has become a very popular study
object among people who are interested in quantum chaos. We shall
introduce the reader very briefly to Wigner's function because it often
yields a concise statement for the general appearance of wave functions
and their relation to classical mechanics. Although Boltzmann's and
Wigner's functions look and act in a very similar manner, they are bona
fide representatives of classical and of quantum mechanics with all the
implied differences. In particular, p and q are not independent variables in quantum mechanics, but are tied together by Heisenberg's uncertainty relations.
The following definitions and properties are valid for both timedependent and stationary wave functions; neither the time t nor the
energy E, whichever applies, will be mentioned explicitly. In order to
prevent confusion with Boltzmann's f(p,q,t), Wigner's function is
called 'lt(p, q). It is defined by the integral

Therefore, if 'l'(p,q) is interpreted as a probability in phase space in the
same way as f(p,q), then it yields at least the correct 'projection' into
position as well as into momentum space.
Although 'I' is real, the main objection against such an interpretation comes from the fact that ')! can be negative. Moreover, the function 'l'(p,q) is badly redundant; it is written as if it depended on 2n
variables, while it is defined on the basis of a single function 1/;(q) of
only n variables. Equivalently, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation
prevents us from specifying both position and momentum for a quantum system. This last objection was already met by Wigner by invoking
what is now commonly called the density matrix in quantum mechanics.
A dynamical system in an experiment is not usually guaranteed to
be in a particular, well-defined quantum state 1/;(q), a pure state.
Rather, there is a mixed state, i.e., a collection of states 1/;j(q), assumed
to be mutually orthogonal for the discussion's sake, and a probability
Pi ~ 0 for the system to be in the state 1/;j(q); of course, I Pi = 1.
Such a mixture is fully described by the density matrix

The Wigner distribution function now becomes
'l'(p, q) = (2'1Tii)-nf d"Q p(q- Q, q + Q) exp( -2ipQ/Ii). (15.13)

The probabilities in momentum space or in position space alone are still
given by the integrals (15.11); the redundancy in the information
contained in 'IT has been removed. The difficulty now comes from the
representation (15.12) of the density matrix; it is a Hermitian operator
whose kernel is given by (15.12) and has all its eigenvalues between 0
and 1, with a trace equal to 1. Clearly, not every real function 'l'(p, q)
satisfies this requirement and can claim a constituent density matrix
p(q" , q1 ) for itself.
Berry (1977a), and later his collaborators, Ozorio and Hannay
(1982, 1983), have explored in great detail what becomes of Wigner's
function when the wave function !f(q) is associated with an invariant
torus in phase space. The generalized classical approximation to
Green's function is used, Gc(q, I, E), where the starting coordinates
are the invariant actions /, and q is the final position, as explained at
the end of Section 12.2; with these replacements, formula (12.28) now
yields the wave function !f(q) to be inserted into (15.10). The limit of
small Planck's quantum has not been taken as yet, although the wave
function has been approximated in the spirit of Van Vleck. It takes
considerable work to establish what happens in the neighborhood of
caustics, in particular when their projection into position space is not
simple; the results can be phrased in the terms of catastrophe theory.
In the limit of li -+ 0, Wigner's function gets concentrated on the
invariant torus that is associated with the eigenstate o/(q). If the invariant actions l(p,q) are expressed as functions of the original momentum p and position q, this result can be written formally as
\}'(p, q) =
8(/(p,q)- /!f)/(2'1T)" .

Figure 42 Spectrum of the wave packet in the ergodic regilon.

The symbols l(p,q) and/"' represent vectors of as many components
as degrees of freedom, and the Dirac 8-function is to be taken as n-dimensional; the values of the actions for the stationary state 1/; have been
called /"f. When li is small, but not zero, Berry shows that Wigner's
function broadens; the size of the peak varies with ll- 2n/ 3 . The
1/3-powers are typical for the Airy functions which arise when a wave
function is investigated near its classical turning point. The simultaneous broadening of the 8-function to a width ~ ll 2n/ 3 implies that
Wigner's functions for different eigenstates in one dimension tend to
overlap, because the space between the corresponding tori equals 2TTil.
While these characteristics are fairly well understood in the
integrable part of phase space, we have to rely on guesswork and numerical results about Wigner's function in the chaotic region. It is easy
to conjecture that 'I' now spreads over the whole domain which is accessible to a particular trajectory. Numerical calculations to prove this
view were first carried out by Hutchinson and Wyatt (1980) on the
Henon-Heiles model. The full four-dimensional phase space, not only
a surface of constant energy, is required for plotting the results; but the
usual surface of section gives already a clear picture. Wigner's function
appears to be quite evenly distributed over the ergodic part. Also, it
vanishes very abruptly outside the region where the potential energy
V(q) exceeds the available total energy E.
When the classical surface of constant energy divides into distinct
chaotic regions which are separated by a KAM torus, Wigner's function is expected to remain confined to one or the other region. Again
the boundary cannot be sharply defined in quantum mechanics; Geisel
et al. (1986) and Radons et al. (1988) made calculations on the kicked
rotator (cf. Section 9.8), a one-dimensional time-dependent system
(one and one-half degrees of freedom in the language of Section 4.3),
where a 'last' torus disappears when one of the parameters exceeds a

246

Wave Functions in Classically Chaotic Systems

critical value. Wigner's function decays exponentially across this classical limit, and the rate of decay varies again with 11- 2 1 3 . Radons and
Prange ( 1988) obtained the scaling of the eigenstates near the last
KAM torus.
Wigner's distribution function ..Y(p,q) is difficult to plot and hard to
interpret because it can be negative. Husimi's distribution function
<l>(p, q) seems better suited to represent a particular wave function or
a mixture in phase space. <I> is based on the coherent- state representation of the harmonic oscillator, i.e., on Gaussian states with minimum
uncertainty in both momentum and position coordinates (Husimi
1940). Without going into the mathematical formalism it may be sufficient to quote the formula which allows one to calculate <I> from '¥,

It is not obvious from this formula that <I> ~ 0; but its interpretation is
straightforward. It is also possible to calculate'¥ from <1>, although such
a transformation is not easy to implement on a computer because the
result depends very sensitively on the exact shape of <1>.
The reader is referred to the recent work of Saraceno and
collaborators who have produced some striking pictures of Husimi
distributions for non-integrable systems (cf. Leboeuf and Saraceno,
preprint ITP). They also show how the underlying coherent-state
formalism can be generalized to any system with a symmetry group,
such as a rotator (cf. Kramer and Saraceno 1981). Adachi (1989) has
studied a form of path integral in phase space with the help of coherent
states; together with Toda and Ikeda ( 1988 and 1989), he has also tried
to display the quantum-mechanic al symptoms of chaos in phase space.

15.5 Correlation Lengths in Chaotic Wave Functions

for a wave function of energy E, and assuming that a typical classical
trajectory actually covers the whole surface of energy E. The
8-function now is one-dimensional in contrast to (15.14); the distribution in phase space is the same as the microcanonical ensemble of
statistical mechanics. All points on the surface of constant energy E
are equally probable.
This distribution can be projected into position space as indicated
in (15.11) to yield I '1/;(q) 1 2 . If the Hamiltonian has the standard form
H(p,q) = p 2 /2m + V(q), the integral over the momentum at a fixed
position q gives

where 8(x) = 0 for x < 0 , and 8(x) = 1 for x ~ 0; the normalization
integral in the denominator has not been written out. Chaos in timeindependent Hamiltonian systems occurs only for n ~ 2; the wave
function '1/;(q), therefore, fills out the whole classicaHy allowed domain
in position space, and has no singularities at its boundary; it even vanishes at the boundary when n > 2.
If Wigner's function (15.14) is projected according as (15 .11) into
position space for an integrable system, I '1/;(q) 1 2 is found to be restricted to the inside of the various caustics that are associated with the
invariant torus
As a function of the distance tlq from a particular
caustic, I '1/;(q) I :::= tl.q- 112; the classical approximation to the wave
function is singular near the caustics. In contrast to the chaotic wave
functions, the regular ones have to accumulate intensity at the caustics
because their domain is severely reduced from the classically allowed
region.

function can be undone to yield the spatial autocorrelation function

not too small to reveal some untypical feature of the wave function \fl.
The local details, however, have already been eliminated in the
microcanonical Wigner's function (15.16) which can, therefore, be directly inserted into (15.17). The integration over p is carried out in
polar coordinates; the 8-function in (15.15) fixes the absolute value
of the momentum, IP I = / 2m(E- V(q)) , leaving only the integral
over the angles, written as an integral over the unit vector Q,

have the local de Broglie wavelength Ill /2m(E - V(q)) .
The wave function tf;(q) can be conceived as built by superposing
the phases from all the classical trajectories which pass through a particular neighborhood; but these phases are uncorrelated because between consecutive returns to the same neighborhood, the trajectory
wanders almost randomly around the energy surface. Various authors
have, therefore, speculated that \f; is a Gaussian random function of q
with a spectrum given by the averaged Wigner's function and the spatial correlation ( 15 .19).

With n = 2 degrees of freedom, the potential V(q) = 0 inside the
stadium, and its area normalized to 1, the average of (15.19) becomes
F( 18 I) = Jo( 18 I /2mE ). The agreement of this simple formula
with the numerical calculations for some of the higher excited states is
quite striking. Nevertheless, the oscillations for large 8 are more pronounced than the zero-order Bessel function indicates.

15.6 Scars, or What Is Left of the Classical Periodic Orbits
Although the results in the preceding section give a rather convincing explanation for the general shapes of chaotic wave functions, at
least in terms of some global averages such as the correlation functions,
Heller, O'Connor, and Gehlen (1989) tried to get a more detailed picture of the eigenstates for the stadium. The calculation was pushed to
the 10,000-th eigenstate, all of them antisymmetric with respect toreflection on the x-axis as well as they-axis. There are roughly 100 nodes
in each direction of position space, so that even rather elaborate patterns can show up quite visibly. Figure 44 shows the absolute value
squared inside the stadium, black when ll/1 I 2 ,exceeds a certain
threshold. Ten consecutive eigenstates in order of increasing energy
are plotted.
The results are striking. Every eigenstate has an intensity pattern
showing what Heller calls scars, i.e., narrow linear regions with an enhanced intensity which stands out clearly and appears to be coming
from classical periodic orbits. It is reasonable to argue that a particular
periodic orbit will show up sometimes in this manner, provided it is not
too unstable; but Figure 44 seems to demonstrate more than such an
obvious comment.
The stability of an unstable periodic orbit is characterized by its
exponent x as defined in Section 6.4. Equivalently, a frequency w and
a Lyapounoff exponent A. can be used; the distance of neighboring
trajectories from the periodic orbit increases with timet as exp(A.t), as
shown in Section 10.6. Scars of a periodic orbit will appear if
X = 2'lT A./ w < 2'lT .
(15.21)
Such a criterion is, of course, not logically precise. Nevertheless it is
remarkably generous, since it allows the appearance of a very long
complicated orbit like the one mentioned in Figure 27 of Section 11.5;
its stability exponent x = 6.875, and neighboring trajectories, therefore, drift away by a factor exp(6.875) ~ 1000 at every turn around
the periodic orbit.
Heller's argument (Heller 1986 and 1987) for the criterion is best
explained with the help of Figure 43. A Gaussian wave packet (15.7)
is launched along a classical periodic orbit at timet= 0. The overlap
< 1/; ll/1(1) > = f dqlf;+(q, 0) 1/;(q, t) has the appearance of Figure 43a
as a function of time: tight Gaussian peaks repeat at intervals corresponding to the period of the orbit T = 2'lT I w; but they decay exponentially with half the Lyapounoff exponent A.. The Fourier spectrum
of the overlap Sy{E) = (2'lT)- 1f dt exp(iEt/li) < 1/;(0) ll/l(t) >, ex-

tended over the finite time interval from - T to + T, has the complementary shape given in Figure 43b.
If the original wave packet 1/;(q, 0) is expanded in the eigenstates
cf>n of the system, one notices that the function Sr{E) is further resolved
into narrow peaks of widths li/T, each corresponding to an energy level
En; the height of the peak gives the intensity In with which cf>n is participating in 1/;(q, 0); of course, these intensities add up to 1. Since they
are concentrated in bands of width liA., which occur at intervals of liw,
the intensities are enhanced by a factor w/A. compared to a completely
random distribution. We find, therefore, a privileged set of eigenstates
that have a marked preference for the particular periodic orbit at the
beginning of this argument. This privilege becomes the more exclusive
the larger the ratio w/A..
The reader should study both the many pictures and the additional
explanations in the papers by Heller and his coworkers. The identification of ridges in the eigenstates with particular periodic orbits is not
always obvious, because there may be families of such orbits that cover
the stadium in an increasingly more involved, yet similar manner, as
shown in Figure 45. As li-0, they do not show up more strongly, because their depth, i.e., contrast with the general background, again depends mostly on x. while the number of nodes goes up inversely with
li.

Figure 45 A very unstable periodic orbit and its brother by reflection on the
y-axis (a) seem to be the main contributors to the highly excited state (b)
[from Heller, O'Connor, and Gehlen (1989)].

As can be seen in Figure 46a the structure of the ridges shows up
even in a random superposition of plane waves, provided they have all
the "same absolute value for the wave vector. When this condition does
not hold any longer, i.e., the length of the wave vector is no longer the
same for all the plane waves in the superposition, one gets a very different picture, like Figure 46b (cf. O'Connor, Gehlen, and Heller
1987).
The scars are not in contradiction with the correlation function
(15 .19), although they came as a surprise to those people who had
proclaimed the random character of wave functions in the classically
chaotic region. The ridges are about one wave length wide; the correlation requires that close-by ridges keep their proper distance. Thus,
complicated periodic orbits get a chance to play a significant role, while
very short, and relatively stable ones would leave large empty spaces.
Increasingly more complex orbits may become important as ll-+ 0, in
agreement with the trace formula to be discussed in Chapter 17, which
reduces the spectrum to a sum over periodic orbits.
The importance of periodic orbits in the eigenstates of classically
chaotic Hamiltonians has become a popular topic for numerical investigations. Waterland, Yuan, Martens, Gillilan, and Reinhardt (1988)
have looked at the quantum surface of section, i.e., the plot of the
Husimi distribution cf>(p,q) in a surface of section for the corresponding

classical system. Most remarkably, they find not only large intensities
near one particular, short periodic orbit, but moreover a pronounced
concentration near the stable and unstable manifolds for the x 2y 2 potential. Eckhardt, Hose, and Pollak (1989) present the pictures for
many eigenstates in this potential, and associate them with groups of
periodic orbits called 'channels', where simple quantization rules like
(14.1) apply. Founargiotakis, Farantos, Contopoulos, and Polymilis
( 1989) compare the eigenstates for a Henon-Heiles type potential with
the classical structure of intersecting stable and unstable manifolds of

The Energy Spectrum of a
Classically Chaotic System

The quantum mechanics for a dynamical system in a compact space
yields a set of discrete energy levels, rather than a continuous range of
possible energies as in classical mechanics. Obviously, the discrete set
of numbers, called the spectrum, can have many more characteristic
features and contains much more information than the continuous,
classical interval. The details of the spectrum change from system to
system; but certain properties are quite general, and some seem to be
directly correlated with the nature of the chaos in the corresponding
classical system.
This chapter is mainly concerned with the statistical distribution of
the energy levels. The average number of levels per unit interval of
energy is directly related to the volume in classical phase space, according to a famous theorem of Weyl which goes back to the very beginning of quantum theory. The more detailed information, however,
such as the spacing between neighboring levels, has only been recognized very recently as connected with the chaotic nature of the trajectories.
After deriving Weyl's formula, we will discuss various measures for
the fluctuations in the spectrum. A particularly useful model is based
on Wigner's idea of choosing a Hamiltonian at random from a sample
that satifies certain basic requirements. The correlations in the resulting Gaussian ensembles of random matrices are found to match very
closely the empirical correlations among energy levels in classically

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

chaotic systems. This phenomenon has not been explained satisfactorily as yet.
The exceptional properties of integrable systems can be explained;
but the change in the characteristics of the spectrum with the transition
to chaos, and the distribution of energy levels in the chaotic regime, can
only be understood with the help of mostly qua1itative arguments.
Nevertheless, the investigation of spectral statistics has revealed a very
important connection between the classical and the quantal behavior
of dynamical systems.

16.1 The Spectrum as a Set of Numbers
Planck started quantum mechanics in 1900 when he assumed that the
energy of a harmonic oscillator comes in discrete steps, rather than
varying continuously as classical mechanics requires. His magic formula, E = h v, or equivalently, E = I! w, gives the smallest increment
in energy which the oscillator can experience if its natural frequency is
v = w/21T. The word 'quantum' to describe this new phenomenon was
used to catch the essence of physics at the atomic scale. Some 25 years
later, it appeared that the wave nature of matter is a more fundamental
attribute than the discrete steps in its allowed energy; but the idea of
'quantum jumps' has caught the imagination of many people, and has
become a figure of speech to dramatize certain unusual events in almost
any field of human activity.
The simple positive multiples of liw were postulated by Planck, in
order to explain the distribution of optical frequencies emitted by a hot
body. It was soon realized, however, that the spectrum, i.e., the allowed
values of the energy, could be much more comp1icated. Bohr found the
set of numbers E = Ryd/n 2 , with n integer and positive, for the energy
levels of the hydrogen atom. ('Ryd' is the natural unit of energy in
atomic physics, and is equal to 13.59 electron-volts.) He also explained
the combination principle: any frequency w seen in an optical experiment can be interpreted as the difference w = (Ek - Er) I I! between
two energy levels, Ek and Er, in the atom or molecule.
Therefore, the word 'spectrum' as applied to a particular small dynamical system has sometimes a different meaning. It designates the
set of frequencies that are seen in an experiment and which are characteristic of the system. An additional effort is necessary to disentangle all of them into a set of energy differences.
Given the many frequencies that such a system emits or absorbs, it
is no mean task to find all the energy levels Ek· A complicated atom

256

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

like iron emits and absorbs thousands of optical frequencies, and a
reasonably simple molecule such as acetylene, H - C - C - H, tens
of thousands if one includes the infrared ( cf. Chen et al 1988); they
can not be labeled with a set of quantum numbers in the usual way (cf.
the work of Abramson et al. 1985, and of Pique et al. 1987, as well
as the review of Jost and Lombardi 1986).
An experiment offers us in general a large, seemingly indiscriminate
set of energy differences and no hint where to start looking for the
underlying set of energy levels. This situation is typical of classically
chaotic systems, because the all-important selection rules for the interpretation of experimental spectral data are missing. They follow directly from the symmetries in the system; but there are none in a
chaotic system, beause otherwise there would be some constants of
motion leading to integrability and invariant tori in phase space.
Experiments or numerical calculations may give us a set of energy
levels, £ 0 :5 £ 1 :5 £ 2 :5 ... , and no sensible numbering scheme, except
the increasing value of the energy. By way of contrast, the reader
should recall how energy levels in simple atoms, like sodium with a
single electron in the outer shell, are described by the appropriate
quantum numbers: the principal quantum number, usually called n; the
orbital angular momentum f, also given in the old spectroscopic notations, p, d,f, g, etc.; the magnetic number m, and so on.
The hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field (cf. Chapter 18) gives
a prime example where this scheme breaks down completely. A direct
connection with the classical periodic orbits, however, offers a novel
and effective method to understand some of the apparent, but confusing regularities. This idea will be discussed in the next two chapters,
whereas at present we will view the spectrum as merely a set of increasing numbers. We will not attempt to give detailed physical arguments for individual energy levels and particular Hamiltonians.
The interesting feature in Planck's spectrum for the harmonic
oscillator, as far as this chapter is concerned, is not the magic formula
E = hw giving the quantum jumps, but the completely regular distribution of its energy levels. If we scale the spectrum by dividing with
liw, then we end up with the simple sequence of integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... ,
about the most boring one could imagine.
The world is full of more interesting sequences whose consecutive
steps are of roughly the same size, and yet they contain all kinds of
non-trivial information in their slight irregularities. A famous example
are the stops on the number 1 subway line which follows Broadway in
New York City for most of its course; they are designated by the
streets the line crosses, from 14-th, 18-th, 23-rd, 28-th, on up to
238-th, and the last stop at 242-nd. Contrary to these indications, the

16.1 The Spectrum as a Set of Numbers

257

average distance between stations is 8 1/7 city blocks, leading to a slow
ride at the beginning and at the end, as well as long walks to the nearest
station in the middle section of the line.
Scientifically minded people from grade school on up are fascinated
by the prime numbers, positive integers p whose only divisors are 1 and
p itself. They are the exceptions among all the integers, and show up
at irregular intervals, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... , 503,509, 521,523,
541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, ... ; notice the
crowding near 570 as opposed to the gap around 530.
The Prime Number Theorem, first proved by Hadamard and de la
Vallee-Poussin in 1896, states that the average density in the neighborhood of x > 0 is given by 1/log x, provided xis sufficiently large.
Another way of expressing this result is to say that the numbers
p /log p have an average density of 1; 'log' is the natural logarithm.
On this scale, the distance between the neighbors 523 and 541 is
2.6794, while the distance between 569 and 571 is only .2655, a factor
of 10 less.
This last example illustrates two basic ingredients into the discussion of this chapter. First, different sequences of energy levels can
be compared provided they have been reduced to the same scale. This
reduction can be carried out as soon as the average number of levels in
an interval of fixed length b.E is known in the limit of large E. Second,
there can be extreme variations in the local distribution, even after the
reduction has been carried out. The main question then is whether
these variations can be characterized, and whether the occurrence of
qualitatively different behavior can be associated with chaos or its absence in the corresponding classical system.

16.2 The Density of States and Weyl's Formula
The spectra of different dynamical systems can only be compared if
they are scaled so as to have an average density of 1 per unit interval,
for large values of the energy. Since the energy levels are the
eigenvalues of the stationary Schrodinger equation (13.6), the
asymptotic distribution of the large eigenvalues has to be found. This
purely mathematical problem has a long and distinguished history,
which started with the physicists Rayleigh, Lorentz, and Debye trying
to understand the thermodynamic properties of electromagnetic radiation in a cavity and the lattice vibrations of a solid body.
The heat content in either case was known to be proportional to the
volume; therefore, a specific heat could be defined, independent of the

258

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

shape of the cavity or the solid body. Each vibration acts like an isolated harmonic oscillator of frequency w, carrying an average energy
iiliw where Planck's distribution law gives n- = 1/[ exp(fiw/k1) - 1].
Many of the higher frequencies contribute to the specific heat at moderate temperatures. Their frequency distribution can, therefore, not
depend significantly on the shape of the cavity or solid body, but only
on the volume.
This result was first checked directly for simple rectangular shapes
and spheres; the general statement was then proposed by the physicists
as a challenge to the mathematicians. Hermann Weyl proved the first
theorem of the required kind in 1912, on the basis of Hilbert's theory
of integral operators. Other proofs and more general propositions have
been found since, although not nearly to the extent needed to justify
all the applications in quantum mechanics.
The mathematicians concentrate mainly on eigenvalue problems
related to the Laplacian in a fixed domain D; that takes care of the vibrations in cavities and solids, but does not address Schrodinger's
equation, except for the various billiard models. The discussion by
Courant and Hilbert in their first volume is based on comparing different shapes, volumes, and boundary conditions. As a rule, the wider
domains and the softer boundary conditions, e.g., vanishing normal
derivative (Neumann) rather than vanishing amplitude (Dirichlet), give
consistently lower frequencies. Thus, both lower and upper limits on
the frequencies for a given eigenvalue problem can be found, in terms
of already known spectra.
A different line of reasoning starts from the partial differential
equation for heat flow in a body with a well-defined coefficient of heat
transport, or equivalently, with the diffusion equation. Rather than
making Planck's constant imaginary, the time in Schrodinger's equation
(13.1) is replaced by t =-iT with real T ~ 0. The expansions like
(13.9) for the propagator remain valid and are now interpreted in terms
of the probability P(q" q' T) for a particle to diffuse from its starting
position q' to its final position q" in the given time T. The further argument has been presented by Kac ( 1966b) in a famous article with the
title: "Can you hear the shape of a drum?" Weyl's original theorem
gives only the dependence of the spectrum on the volume, but not on
the shape.
In a purely formal manner, we replace it in the exponent by T in the
expansion (13.9). Then we set q" = q' = q, and argue that I cpj(q) 1 2
averages out to 1I A,where A stands for the area of D. Therefore,
P(q, q, T)~A- 1 iexp(- £ 1 T/fi) = A- 1 f""e-E-r/lidN(E),

where the sum over the energies has been written as a Laplace integral;
N(E) is the number of eigenstates of energy ::5 E.
The density
p(E) = dN(E) I dE consists of a sequence of Dirac o- functions in the
case of a discrete spectrum; the number of energy levels N(E) looks
like an ascending staircase. The expression ( 16.1) is now interpreted
as arising from a diffusion process for short times T.
As a first step, we note that a particle starting in q', inside D, takes
some time to reach the boundary. Until then, the formula (12.21) for
the free particle is applicable; since q'' = q' = q, the exponential becomes 1. If we consider the case of two dimensions, we are left with
P(q, q, T) ~ m/2'TTih, which is to be compared with the last expression
in (16.1). Since both sides are valid for small values of T, their equality
should tell us something about the density p(E) for large values of E.
Some subtle mathematics gets involved at this point in the form of
the Tauberian theorems from the theory of Laplace transforms. We can
simply check that the two expressions become equal if one replaces
p(E) in (16.1) by
2m
A
(16.2)
p =

which is already Weyl's theorem, if we interpret p as the average density
of energy levels.
The next step lets the diffusing particle feel the effect of the
boundary for a short while. The average over q11 = q' = q now has a
term from the boundary where the particle does not diffuse freely, but
gets reflected or absorbed according as the boundary condition. This
process can at first be treated as if it occurred in one dimension where
everything can be worked out in detail; later on, the curvature of the
boundary can be taken into account. The new term is proportional to
the length of the boundary, and inversely proportional to
The
average density p has to be corrected correspondingly, again with the
help of the Tauberian theorems, or simply by checking the Laplace integral.
If even the next term in the diffusion process near the boundary is
included, either with the Dirichlet condition 1/; = 0 (upper sign), or with
the Neumann condition iN/ an= 0 (lower sign), the average number
N(E) of energy levels below the energy E becomes

boundary conditions, as well as on the shape. Figure 4 7 shows the
staircase-like function N(E) for the billiard inside the stadium, as well
as the corresponding smooth function N(E) according as (16.3).
The explanations in the preceding few paragraphs are meant to give
an idea of the physical arguments which go into Weyl's formula and its
extension to lower energies. The reader will find a much more informative account in two remarkable papers by Balian and Bloch ( 1970
and 1971). These authors deal with the asymptotic distribution of the
eigenvalues for the Laplacian in a three-dimensional domain; they
work out the surface as well as the curvature term, and they include the
general linear boundary condition a</> I an = - tc</> where aI an is the
derivative along the normal to the bounding surface. Maxwell's
equations are covered, as well as waves on a Riemannian surface; the
underlying space is allowed to have any number of dimensions.
Weyl's formula (16.2) has a remarkable interpretation in terms of
classical mechanics. Since the potential energy V = 0 inside the D, the
kinetic energy for the particle bouncing around is constant, and the
absolute value of its momentum Ip 12 = 2mE. The total volume of
phase space with energy less than E is given by n(E) = ., 2mE A.
The first term in (16.3) becomes, therefore, N(E) ~ n(E)I(2.,1f) 2 .
Quite generally, for a Hamiltonian system with f degrees of freedom,
in the limit of large E, the number of eigenstates with energy less than E
equals the number of cells of size h f contained in the volume of phase
space with energy less than E. The average density of eigenstates per
unit interval of energy is given by

16.2 The Density of States and Weyl's Formula
p(E) =

261

(16.4)

in a system with f degrees of freedom.
The formula ( 16.4) is of the utmost importance for treating many
interacting particles in lowest approximation, such as the ThomasFermi model of atoms, the Sommerfeld theory of metals, Bose-Einstein
condensation, the distribution of electron energies in /3-ray emission,
and the calculation of nuclear binding energies. It also provides a rationale for the basic assumption of classical statistical mechanics: the
probability for a system to be in a particular subset of phase space is
proportional to the volume of the subset. Of course, it is consistent
with Liouville's theorem and the adiabatic principle.
The second and third terms in (16.3) extend the validity of Weyl's
formula (16.2) to lower energies; but they give no information about
local accumulations of eigenvalues. The remainder of this chapter is
concerned with finding the appropriate statistical measures for the
fluctuations, N(E) - N(E).

16.3 Measures for Spectral Fluctuations
Instead of studying the values of the energy levels Ek, we will look at
the values Nk = N(Ek), where N(E) gives the number of levels below
E in the limit of large E. The function N(E) is either taken directly
from ( 16.3) in the case of a billiard in a compact domain, or it is calculated from the volume of phase space as indicated in (16.4). This
reduction was already illustrated when the prime numbers were mentioned; N(x) ~ x/log x so that the points p/logp on the real axis,
rather than the prime numbers p themselves, are investigated. The reduced energies will be called Ek again.
The simplest, and perhaps most telling, statistical measure is the
spectral distribution Q(x) dx, which is the probability of finding an energy level in the interval a + x :::; E < a + x + dx if there is an energy
level at E = a. A related measure, called the spacing of energy levels,
is the probability P(x) dx for finding two consecutive energy levels a
distance x apart, the lower at E = a, and the upper in the interval
a + x :::; E < a + x + dx ; of course, f P(x) dx = 1. For the harmonic
oscillator, P(x) is simply a 8-function peak at x = 1. The opposite extreme has a completely random distribution of energy levels with average density 1. The function Q(x) = 1 since the probability for
finding an energy level is now independent of the already known level
at x = 0.

262

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

The functions Q(x) and P(x) are related in the following way. We
choose a segment of (integer) length L, and divide it into small intervals, all of the same length E. We place L markers at random, independently of one another, with the probability Q(x) dx, into the small
intervals. The first marker above 0 will hit any particular small interval
with probability EQ(~)/ L, and miss any other small interval with
probability 1 - EQ(O/ L where ~ is some coordinate inside the small
interval in question. Now we choose a contiguous interval of length x,
and require the probability that none of the markers fall within x, while
there is a marker in a + x ~ E < a + x + dx. Clearly, we have to form
the product of all the 1 - EQ(~)/ L for 0 < ~ < x, and multiply with
EQ(x)/L. In the limit of small E and/or large L, we find that
P(x) = Q(x) exp[- fd~Q(O]. In particular the random distribution
of energy levels, Q(x) = 1 yields the Poisson distribution
P(x) = exp( -x).
The spacings of energy levels will presumably have a distribution
between the rigid ladder of the harmonic oscillator and the exponential
decay. Quite unexpectedly, the integrable systems are found to have a
Poisson-like spacing of energy levels. The classically chaotic systems,
however, tend toward a rigid spacing, although their statistics is much
more complicated as we shall see.
The staircase character of N(E) is more pronounced, the more the
spectrum deviates from the rigid spacing. A striking case is the set of
the eigenvalues A of the Laplacian on the sphere, ~</> + A</> = 0; the
area A = 47T, so that Weyl's formula yields a level density 1 for large
A. The spectrum is given by the values of the total angular momentum
in units of li, so that A = f(£ + 1) with the multiplicity 2f + 1 and
f ~ 0.
A measure for the deviation from equal spacing, called the rigidity,
was introduced by Dyson and Mehta ( 1963) who defined the function
~ 3 (L; a) =

where the constants A and B will give a best local fit to N(E) in the
interval a ~ E < a + L. The variable a is used to define the various
averages < ... > over part or all of the spectrum, while the length L
~ves an indication of the window over which the spectrum is viewed.
~3(L) is the average over a.
The harmonic oscillator gives the least possible value with
~ 3 = 1/12. The motion of a particle on a sphere, or equivalently, the
symmetric rotator yield a rigidity which varies as a increases, and will
go through maxima given by L 2 /3. A completely random spectrum,

16.3 Measures for SpectrallFluctu ations

263

with the Poisson spacing, has an average rigidity ~S 3 = L/ 15 independent of a.
For completeness sake, we shall list some further standard measures. They are based on the number n(a,L) of energy levels in the interval from a to a + L. The variance is given by the standard
expression
L. 2(L) = < [n(a,L) - < n(a,L) > f > .
(16.6)
The corresponding third and fourth power averages, after division by
2. 3 and 2: 4 , give the skewness y 1(L), and the excess or kurtosis Y2(L).

16.4 The Spectrum of Random Matrices
Nuclear physics, in contrast to atomic and molecular physics, studies
the interaction between particles whose forces of attraction and
repulsion are not well understood. Protons and neutrons are not even
point-like objects on the nuclear scale of I0- 13 em. The constituents
of an atom or a molecule, the nuclei and the electrons surrounding
them, however, have vanishing dimensions on the atomic scale of
1o-x em; the electrostatic forces between them, with minor corrections for magnetic moments, are all we need to write down a complete Hamiltonian.
In the face of this uncertainty in nuclear physics, Wigner turned the
problem around, and asked for the spectrum of an object whose
Hamiltonian is unknown, or more precisely, a Hamiltonian that is
drawn at random from a large collection, subject only to the general
restrictions of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, the result is not trivial. Wigner compared it to the distribution of the planets whose origin
and order around the Sun is also poorly understood at this time. Nevertheless, the planets show a striking regularity in their distances from
the Sun, and in their masses. Empirical 'laws' like the geometric
progression in the major axes, known as the Titius-Bode law, might
arise from almost any initial distribution of clouds in the solar neighborhood (a detailed review was recently given by Nieto 1972).
The detailed discussion of random Hamiltonians becomes rather
technical. Bohigas and Giannoni ( 1984) have written a good introduction (cf. also Jose 1988). Some of the basic ingredients can be explained without too much formal mathematics. As usual, the upper
index + on a matrix indicates the Hermitian transpose (or conjugate),
(T+)ik = (Tk)+, while the upper index + on a number indicates its
complex conjugate. The Hamiltonian is assumed to be a Hermitian

264

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

matrix H with a finite number K of rows and columns, i.e.,
(Hki )+ = HJk·
A first basic consideration concerns the invariance of the
Hamiltonian with respect to time reversal, or in more practical terms,
the presence or absence of a magnetic field B. If the Hamiltonian stays
the same under time-reversal, or has an equivalent symmetry, then it
can always be reduced to a real symmetric matrix by an appropriate
unitary transformation without changing the eigenvalues (for an exhaustive discussion of this question, cf. Berry and Robnik 1986). That
leaves K(K + 1)/2 parameters to be chosen at random; but a reasonable measure to define the probability of each choice has to be determined.
The argument is no more sophisticated than finding the correct definition of the distance of a point (x, y, z) from the origin in a Cartesian
coordinate system. Since the distance is not supposed to change when
the coordinate axes are rotated around some arbitrary direction, it can
only be some function f(r) where r 2 = x 2 + y 2 + z 2. Similarly, the
probability for finding a particular matrix H should be independent of
the set of basis vectors that was chosen to obtain the matrix elements
HJk· A change of basis requires a transformation H' = T+ HT with a
K by K (real) orthogonal matrix T, satisfying the condition T+T = I.
There exist a total of K different functions Fn of the matrix elements
H 1k which remain the same under any orthogonal transformation T.
These invariants were already mentioned in the discussion of the Toda
lattice in Section 3.6. The two simplest were written down explicitly,
F 1 = 2.1 ~J and Fz = L.1kHJkHkJ- For£> 2, however, Fp becomes
a rather complicated polynomial of degree£. In defining our ensemble
of random matrices, we are free to fix the value of any or all of the
functions Fr; but only F 1 and F 2 will be given in advance, while the
others will be left to chance, because they are directly involved in the
spacing of the eigenvalues.
If the matrix H has been diagonalized, its diagonal elements
>I.J, A. 2 , ... , A.K are the eigenvalues, so that F 1 = L A.r , and F2 = L A.p
By fixing F 1 in advance, we prescribe the average of the eigenval~es;
and by fixing F 2 in advance, we prescribe the sum of their squares; but
their spacings have not been fixed except through their mean value and
their overall spread. The product dfl = TI d~k where j $ k is easily
shown to be invariant under orthogonal transformations T and defines
the appropriate measure in the space of the K(K + 1)/2 matrix elements Hik·
At this point, we have what could be called a microcanonical ensemble, if we associate F2 with the energy, in analogy to the Toda
lattice. Most calculations, however, are easier if we use the argument

16.4 The Spectrum of Random Matrices

265

of Maxwell when he first wrote down the velocity distribution of the
particles in a gas: the probability density which multiplies the measure
dfl is required to be the product of K(K + 1)/2 functionsf(H1k) where
each depends only on the particular matrix element HJk· Thus, we

for the probability of the matrix H, the typical expression for a

The Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) is defined by (16.7) with
B = 0. The answer to various questions is found by carrying out the
necessary integrations. They become quite tricky, however, and the
reader has to consult the review by Rosenzweig ( 1963) or the book by
Mehta (1967) for the details. As a preliminary step, the integration is
carried out while keeping the eigenvalues ~q, .\ 2 , ... , .\K fixed and arbitrary. The result is remarkably simple and clear-cut,

the spread a is related to the constant A in (16.7) and (16.8) by

a2 = 1I A. This function represents a half-circle of radius av'f(, a

result that Wigner (1957) had already conjectured.
The main result of this whole theory is the probability P(x) dx for
finding two adjacent eigenvalues with a spacing between x and
x + dx. There is no simple expression in closed form, but there is the
Wigner's surmise that
P(x) ~

This function, although not exact, is within a few percent of the exact
result; since most experimental and numerical data come in the shape
of rather coarse histograms, Wigner's surmise is amply sufficient. (The
exact slope of the P(x) at x = 0 is rr 2/6 = 1.6449 rather than

266

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

1T /2 = 1.5708; in other words, the percentage difference in the initial
slope is 1r /3 - 1 = .04 72 !)
The spacing distribution (16.1 0) is in stark contrast to the Poisson
distribution P(x) = exp( -x) of the preceding section, which arises
when the eigenvalues are thrown at random into a finite interval. Already the nuclear resonances in uranium [J2 3 X under neutron
bombardment, which were obtained in the 1950s, show very clearly the
level repulsion as given by (16.10). Notice that both probabilities are
not only normalized, but their mean is also 1, i.e., Jx P(x) dx = 1.
Their variances, however, are very different; for the Poisson distribution, f(x- 1) 2P(x) dx = 1, whereas for Wigner's surmise this integral= 4/1T -1 = .5224.
The rigidity (16.5) for the GOE is

instead of L/ 15 for the random distribution of eigenvalues in the interval of length L, or 1/12 for equal spacing. The strong tendency toward a harmonic-oscillator-like spectrum is quite striking in the GOE.

16.5 The Density of States and Periodic Orbits
Percival (1973) first coined the words "regular" and "irregular" as
appplied to the spectrum of a quantum-mechanical system. The criterion for labeling energy levels in this manner is their sensitivity to perturbations. Pomphrey ( 197 4) showed that this idea worked well for
the Henon-Heiles model, when the perturbation was a change in the
non-linear coupling parameter; Pullen and Edmonds ( 1981) got similar
results for a fourth-order potential. He also found that the relative
number of regular levels in some limited energy range was roughly the
same as the proportion of volume in phase space that is occupied by
invariant tori.
Since then, closer inspection of the spectrum in the Henon-Heiles
model has shown that most energy levels can be labeled with ordinary
quantum numbers all the way into the chaotic region (cf. Section
14.3 ). Doubts about the simple distinction between a regular and an
irregular part in the spectrum have also been voiced by Weissman and
Jortner (1981). They investigated the evolution of wave-packets with
time, and concluded that there were two entirely different limiting
types: rapid dephasing and nearly quasiperiodic behavior. But they
could not identify a clearcut transition from one regime to the other,

16.5 The Density of States and Periodic Orbits

267

and compare it to the transition from invariant tori to chaos in the
classical system as illustrated in Figure 15.
A regular spectrum will, therefore, simply be defined as given by a
formula like (14.11): there are as many quantum numbers n 1, n2 , .•. as
degrees of freedom, and a smooth function r of as many actions
11, h .... to yield the whole spectrum of interest. The Maslov indices,
and the consequent replacement of nj by nj + {3/2, depend on the
problem at hand, and do not change any of the discussion; they will be
left out of the further manipulations. The energies are then the values
of a smooth function r on a regular grid of lattice distance li in the
positive 'quadrant'; r does not necessarily come from a calculation
based on classical orbits. It can be a fit to the empirical data, or it could
result from a theory like the Birkhoff-Gustavson normalization of
Section 14.3 which seems sometimes valid even in the classically
ergodic region of phase space.
The density of states can then be written as
p(E)

= L 8(£ -

f(n li)) ,

(16.12)

n

where n is the vector of the integers n 1, n2 , •••• The regular lattice inn
immediately invites the theorist to write p(E) as a Fourier sum over a
reciprocal lattice indexed by a vector M of integers, exactly as in
solid-state physics; the 8-function peaks in (16.12) are then generated
by a superposition of plane waves of wave-vector M.
This route was taken for the first time bv Berry and Tabor (1976,
1977 a, 1977b ), in order to calculate the spacing probability P(x) for
such a regular spectrum. We shall follow these authors fairly closely,
not only because of the final result, but also because their arguments
give a good introduction to the more general considerations of the next
chapter. Again, we shall only indicate the important steps, and leave
to the reader the task of working through the mathematical details.
Poisson's formula carries out the transformation from the direct
lattice of quantum numbers n to the reciprocal lattice M, whose interpretation will be given shortly. For simplicity's sake, let us consider the
variable s in one dimension, - oo < s < + oo, and some well-behaved
integrable function g(s); its Fourier transform is called
x(a) = fds g(s) exp( -2'TTisa) with - oo <a< + oo. A short calculation yields

n =-x

v =-oc

L g(n) = L x(v) .

(16.13)

As an example, take the Gaussian g(s) = exp( - '" s 2 I e 2 ) and its
Fourier transform x(a) = e exp(- '"a 2 e2 ). The width e of the peak

268

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

in g(s) is reciprocal to the width 1I e of x (a), and the convergence of
the two series in (16.12) behaves accordingly.
The summation over each quantum number n1 is now converted with
the help of ( 16.13) into a summation over M,
p(E) =

~~

f

d 1I 8(E- f(I)) e 217 i(M,I)/fi

,

(16.14)

where f is the number of degrees of freedom. The reader may want to
replace the Dirac 8-function in (16.12) and (16.14) by
exp[ - 1r(E - H(I) ) 2I e2], where both the energy E and the width e are
parameters, while the actions I take on integer multiples of li. Formula
( 16.14) is then the limit of e going to zero.
The first term in ( 16.14), M = 0, is the classical density of states
as given in (16.4),
p0 (E)

= li - I f d 11 8(E- H(I)) .

(16.15)

In this section, however, we are interested in the deviations from this
smooth asymytotic density of states. Thus, we will discuss only the
fluctuations p(E), i.e., the terms in (16.14) where M =F 0. They all
have a non-trivial factor exp(2'TTi(M,I)IIi) in the integrand and will be
treated by the stationary-phase method of Section 12.5. The validity
of this method depends on the remainder of the integrand varying
slowly compared to the exponential; therefore, the integers M are assumed to be large. Since the 8-functions are very sharp, the Poisson
formula requires many terms.
The stationary phase method requires finding the values of the
actions /, where the first derivatives of the exponent M 1! 1 + ... +
Mr Ir with respect to the I's vanish, provided H(I) = E. With the help
of a Lagrange multiplier 1 I w0 , and the formula ()HI ai1 = w1 , it follows that w1 = M1 w 0 as in Section 6.2. The individual frequencies w1
are integer multiples of the common frequency w0 , as in Section 6.2.
Therefore, the formula (1 6.14) for the density of states at the energy E
can be interpreted as a sum over the classical periodic orbits at E.
This central idea will be further explored in the next chapter for the
general case of a classically chaotic system. Right now, the formulas
for the integrable case will be worked out in more detail, so that the
contrast with the next chapter can be seen more clearly. Although the
presentation in this chapter is largely due to Berry and Tabor, the author (Gutzwiller 1970) was the first to discuss such a formula for an
integrable system with two degrees of freedom. In one degree of freedom, the reduction to periodic orbits is trivial, and has been effectively
practiced for a long time. The author's work on the hydrogen atom

16.5 The Density of States and Periodic Orbits

269

(Gutzwiller 1967) is an example, as is some of the work of Norcliffe
and Percival (1968).
The integration extends over the constant energy surface near the
stationary point where w1 = ~- w0 . The exponent (M, I) in (16.13)
is expanded to second order in the displacements 8h around the stationary value 10 , while the energy is kept fixed. It is natural to use a
local coordinate system in action space where the first action points
along the normal to the surface of constant energy, while the f- 1 remaining actions are tangential. In order to do the integration over the
8(£ - H(I)) in (16.14), we also replace the first of the new actions by
the local variation in energy 8£. The Jacobian for these trivial transformations of the integration variables is 1I w 1 ; the exponent now becomes simply 2'1Ti 1M I8Idfi, where 1M I is the absolute value of the
vector M.
The constant energy surface is then given by
811 = - "L' Hik 811 8h/ H1 ; the indices on H indicate the corresponding
derivatives with respect to the actions I, and the prime on ~ restricts
the summation to j,k > 1.
Each term in (16.14) is now in the standard form (12.23) for a
multidimensional Fresnel integral. The fluctuating part of the density
of states becomes
p(E) =

(16.16)
=

where the actions at the stationary point have been distinguished by the
index 0 from the local action coordinates in the determinant and the
prefactor. The second line defines the coefficients A(E, M), which
multiply the phase factors exp[iS(£, M)/fi].
Notice that
w 1 = Igrad1 HI and that the det' (H1k) is a measure for the curvature
of the constant-energy surface in action space. The prime indicates
again that only the local actions 8h, ... , 811 are involved.
The reader should try to apply the formula (16.16) to the simplest
case of an integrable system, the motion of a particle in a rectangular

270

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

features of (16.16) appear in this special example with particular clarity; but they are valid for more general integrable systems.

16.6 Level Clustering in the Regular Spectrum
Formula (16.16) for the fluctuations in the density of states p(E) will
be derived in the next chapter from a different starting point. We will
then inquire how this sum over all the periodic orbits manages to yield
the sharp 8-function peaks in (16.12). In this section, however, we
will ask whether (16.16) can tell us something about the correlations
in p(E). The method is motivated by the formulas (14.12) and (14.13),
although certain modifications will have to be made ultimately, in order
to put the whole thing together as Berry and Tabor did.
The variable x in (14.12) whose autocorrelation we are trying to
find, is the density p, and the time variable tis replaced by E. Formula
(14.13) requires that we calculate the Fourier transform ~(2'TTI11w) of
p(E) with respect to E; the variable of this transform will ~be 2called
2'TT I 11w for the lack of a better name. The absolute square I a I gives
us the 'power spectrum' II(2'TTI11w) of p(E), i.e., the Fourier transform
of the autocorrelation< p(E)p(E +e)> according as (14.12).
The formEla (16.16) can be interpreted as the Fourier representation of p(E), if we consider the exponent of each term
2'TTi(M, 10 )111 as a function of E. Therefore, the squares of the absolute values for the coefficients A(E,M) in (16.16), if properly summed
up, are directly involved in the autocorrelation of p(E).
Quite generally, the phase of a particular term in (16.16) changes
with the energy E as the period (2'TT I 11) (M, olol oE) = 2'TT I 11wo, calculated for fixed M. Since 11 w0 increases as I M I, if the energy and
the frequency ratios are kept constant, terms in (16.16) with different
M are completely out of phase (incoherent), as E varies in the neighborhood of £ 0 , unless they share the same value of w0 . Our job is then
to sum up the squares I A(E, M) 1 2 of the amplitudes in (16.16) which
belong to the same value of the energy E near E 0 , and to the same value
of the frequency w0 near w.
If the reader finds the formal manipulations at this point
Take
discombobulating, the following steps are recommended.
IA(E, M) 1 2 in (16.16), multiply with the necessary 8-functions,
8(E- E 0 ) and 8((2'TTI11w 0 ) - (2'TTI11w)), where w is the required constant value of w0 . Now consider the integral over the f + 1 variables
E, M 1 , ••• , M 1 ; replacing the sum over theM's by an integral is justified, because each term has the small factor we{- 1 . Since w1 = M1w0 ,

16.6 Level Clustering in the Regular Spectrum

271

however, and the energy E can be considered as a well-defined function of WJ, ... , Wf (cf. the latter part of Section 14.4), we now switch to
the integration variables w0 , w 1, ... , Wf; without the help of the local
coordinates, the Jacobian is given by (w 1oE/ow 1 + ... )/we{+ 1• At this
point, the integral over w 0 is carried out with the help of its
8-function, and we are left with an integral over all frequency space,

def (~k)

where we have already used the local coordinates in the denominators,
as in (16.16).
The last step converts everything to the local variables, and again
to the energy in order to get rid of 8(E- E 0 ). In particular,
dw 1 = dE/(oE/ ow 1 ), and the additional terms in the numerator
vanish. The integral over E is now done, which leaves us with an integral over the surface of constant energy Eo in frequency space.
The determinant in the denominator is nothing but the Jacobian
o(w2, ... , Wj)/ o([z, ... , Ij), which can be brought into the numerator by
inverting it. Thus, we get rid of the frequency space, and are now left
with an integral over the constant-energy surface in the action space,
as in (16.15). The final result is

The left-hand side is the 'power spectrum' I1(2'TT I Piw) of the density
p(E), i.e., the Fourier transform (in terms of the variable 2'TT/Piw) of the
autocorrelation function < p(E)p(E + e) >. The result of our labors
is given by the right-hand side, which turns out to be surprisingly simple, since it is independent of 2'TT I Piw; the energy occurs only because
all our calculations apply to a particular interval of energy around E.
Such a relation is called a sum rule; it sets the sum of the absolute
squares in an expansion like (16.16) equal to a quantity which is easy
to calculate like (16.15). Sum rules usually have a simple physical origin, not unlike Weyl's formula (16.2), which says that a particle needs
a minimum time to reach the boundary of a domain by diffusion. The
above sum rule, due to Berry and Tabor, has meanwhile found its explanation by Hannay and Ozorio de Almeida ( 1984) and will be discussed again in the next chapter.
Since the average density of states p 0 (E) in (16.15) is, in general,
not a constant, a fake energy U has to be defined such that the density
with respect to U becomes 1. Therefore,
U(E) = Pi-!

(16.19)

272

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

where E>(x) = 0 for x < 0, and E>(x) = 1 for x ~ 0. The modified
spectrum is defined by the fake Hamiltonian W(I) = U(H(I)), which
replaces H(I) everywhere in the preceding derivation, including the
formulas (16.14), (16.15), (16.16), and (16.18). The new density will
be called p1 (U) and its mean p 1o(U) = 1. The spectral density (14.12)
for the autocorrelation of p' ( U) reduces then simply to the value
1 /2'TT, independent of both the frequency w0 and the energy U0 .
The last step in finding the autocorrelation function for an
integrable spectrum relates directly the 'power spectrum' II with the
spectral distribution Q(x) (cf. Section 16.3). The reader is asked to
check the paper by Berry and Tabor ( 1977b) for the proof of the general formula,
Q(x)

=

1 +

f

+oc

-oc

dK eiKX (Il(K) - - 1- ] ,
2'TT

where we have abbreviated " = 2'TT/Iiw. Because of (16.18) and
Po = 1, the function Q(x) = 1; therefore, the energy levels are
spaced according as the Poisson distribution (again cf. Section 16.3).
In a very qualitative argument we could say that the energy levels are
randomly distributed because the 'power spectrum' (16.18) does not
single out any preferred frequencies.
Is the Poisson distribution for the energy levels in an integrable
system correct? The first numerical check was carried out by Casati,
Chirikov, and Guarneri (1985) on the simplest possible case, a particle
in a rectangular box, the two-dimensional version of (16.17). If the
ratio y of the square of the sides, at I a2, is rational, there are many degeneracies among the energy levels; they are explained by one of the
highly developed as well as non-trivial parts of number theory, the
quadratic forms of integers. To get away from these accidental complications, y is chosen to be irrational.
The authors put y = 'TT/3 and calculated 100,000 levels from the
simple formula E = y m 2 + n 2 . With this kind of statistics, even
seemingly minor deviations from the expected result quickly indicate
some major discrepancies. The most important discovery was the saturation of the rigidity; instead of increasing as L/15 with L, as indicated after formula (16.5), the rigidity X3(L) becomes effectively
constant rather abruptly for L > Lc ; the exact value of the critical
length Lc depends on the sample chosen, i.e., the range of a in (16.5).
According to Casati, Guarneri, and Valz-Gris (1984), the saturation is explained by the underlying structure for the energy spectrum
of an integrable system, namely a simple grid of points. The number
of levels between two energies E and E + e is quite random as a function of E, as long as e is small, i.e., Lis sufficiently small in (16.5), say

16.6 Level Clustering in the Regular Spectrum

273

of the order 15. If L becomes much larger, however, the elliptic
annulus between E and E + e in the plane of actions (/1, h) contains
a good portion of the regular grid structure, and the random character
gets lost. The rigidity then approaches the constant value corresponding to the harmonic oscillator.
Seligman and Verbaarschot (1987) and Verbaarschot (1987) have
studied various statistical measures for the spectrum of independent
non-linear oscillators. Using the ideas of Berry (1985), some of which
were discussed above, and others that will be brought up in the next
chapter, they succeeded in explaining the saturation of the rigidity
analytically, in addition to making extensive numerical checks. Nevertheless, their arguments apply only to scale-invariant systems where
the potential energy is a homogeneous polynomial in the position coordinates, while the reasoning of Berry and Tabor is more general. The
deviations from Poisson statistics for the spacing o:f energy levels in
integrable systems need further work to be fully understood.

16.7 The Fluctuations in the Irregular Spectrum
The evidence for a connection between nuclear energy levels and random matrices remained inconclusive for almost 25 years after the pioneering work of Wigner. Haq, Pandey, and Bohigas (1982) then
analyzed the whole body of high-quality data, 1407 resonances corresponding to 30 sequences of 27 different nuclei. They investigated
both the spacing of the energy levels P(x) and the rigidity (16.5) as a
function of L, both shown in Figure 48. "Astonishingly good agreement" was found between the experimental data and the Gaussian
Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), although there are no parameters to fit.
Further statistical analysis is given by Bohigas, Haq, and Pandey
(1985).
Bohigas, Giannoni, and Schmit ( 1984a) applied the same statistical
technique for the first time to an artificial spectrum. They chose Sinai's
billiard, a unit-square with a circular hole of radius R in the center, and
hard reflections on the boundary. Its classical behavior is known to be
strongly ergodic; there exists a good asymptotic formula for its level
distribution, (16.3), including the terms in the length of the boundary
and its curvature. Fluctuations are, therefore, easily separated from the
smoothed density of levels. Berry ( 1981) had earlier established an
efficient algorithm for finding the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in this
domain, with the help of the Kohn-Korringa-R ostoker method from
band calculations in solid-state physics.

and Pandey ( 1983)].

Since the domain allows for a group of symmetries with eight elements, the results have to be segregated for each particular symmetry
of the wave functions with respect to reflections on the median lines
and the diagonals of the square. If the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian
are antisymmetric with respect to every one of these reflections, the
wave functions vanish on the symmetry lines, corresponding to
Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectrum is the same as for the
reduced domain that consists of a right-angled isoceles triangle from
which a pie-shaped piece has been removed on one of the corners. The
deviations from the ideal GOE curves can be accounted for by the finite sampling, i.e., the finite upper limit to the reliable eigenvalues.
The success of the GOE statistics was further confirmed by data
on atomic spectra of rare-earth metals by Camarda and Georgopoulos
(1983), as well as in simple molecules such as N0 2 by Haller, Koppel,
and Cederbaum (1983), at least as far as Wigner's surmise (16.10) for
the spacing of levels (further data are given by Zimmermann et al. 1987
and 1988).
Large-scale calculations of energy levels were carried out for the
stadium by Bohigas, Giannoni, and Schmit (1984b). They computed
not only the rigidity 'K 3 and the spacing P(x), but also the variance L 2
as given in (16.6), as well as the skewness and the excess. The agreement with GOE is unexpectedly close and complete. It led to the
speculation that GOE statistics is a "universal" characteristic of the
energy levels in classically chaotic systems.

16.7 The Fluctuations in the Irregular Spectrum

2 75

Deviations from this norm were soon found, however, in two systems with the hard form of classical chaos. The first of these, the
eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a compact smooth surface of constant
negative curvature, will be discussed in Chapter 19; it should have been
the ideal example, but subtle distinctions seem to be at work which are
not understood. The second system is the Anisotropic Kepler Problem
where Wintgen and Marxer ( 1988) have recently obtained some 5000
levels, shown in Figure 49. Significant deviations from GOE appear in
all the statistical measures for L > 7, although the fit for L up to 2
or 3 is quite good; the deviations all tend toward the Poisson distribution.
Those physicists who want to find universally valid simple rules
found themselves disappointed in their hopes, whereas those who look
for a rich variety of different behavior felt encouraged. The search is
now on, both for reasons explaining the departures from GOE, and for
getting better numerical data to see where GOE breaks down in spite
of the classical chaos. Some features might then be discovered
whereby different types of quantum chaos can be recognized, if not
explained.

16.8 The Transition from the Regular to the Irregular Spectrum
Since the statistical properties are so clearly different for the regular
and the irregular spectra, the question about the transition from one to
the other arises immediately. The theory of random matrices gives no
clue concerning the connection between the two types of statistics.
While there are good arguments to associate regular spectra with classically integrable systems (cf. Section 16.5), and irregular spectra with
the classically chaotic ones (cf. the next section as well as the next
chapter), the intermediate regime is poorly understood. Nevertheless,
a number of numerical studies have been undertaken, and some will
be mentioned in this section to give the reader an idea of the extent to
which this general problem has been investigated.
The computations of this kind require a continuous sequence of
dynamical systems which go from integrable at one end to chaotic at
the other end. A particularly obvious example comes from the conformal maps of the unit-circle, such as the simplest quadratic map
proposed by Robnik (1984), w = Az + Bz 2 where w = u + iv and
z = x + iy are complex variables, and the ratio B I A is the parameter
starting from 0 at the integrable end of the sequence. The image of the
unit-circle is the domain for a billiard with reflecting walls; its area is

density 1 of eigenvalues for the Laplacian according to Weyl's formula.
This scheme suggests a relatively simple set of basis functions in
which to expand the eigenfunctions: indeed, if we use the variable z as
coordinate in the transformed unit circle, Schrodinger's equation becomes !:J.cp + 1\J(x, y)cp = 0, where J = I dw/ dz 12 and z is limited to the
unit-circle. If J = 1, the eigenfunctions are a well-known set of Bessel
functions, which can serve as a basis set when J =F 1; the Laplacian
acting on this set is easy to handle. The continuous distortion of the

16.8 Transition from Regular to Irregular Spectrum

277

eigenfunctions, as Bl A increases from 0, can be watched in detail, in
particular when two eigenvalues try to cross each other.
The distributions P(x) of the level spacings are plotted as
histograms for the increasing values of B I A. These plots are not very
striking, however, unless a great many levels have been computed.
They are, therefore, fitted with a set of distributions that was suggested
by Brody et al. (1981),
Pv(x) = ax"exp(-bx"+ 1 ) ,

(16.20)

where the real constants a and b are chosen to insure both the normalization JPv(x )dx = 1 and the average spacing JxPv(x )dx = 1. A best
fit with respect to v for a given B I A is obtained by minimizing the
mean-square deviation between the numerical results for the spacings
and Pv . There is a steady transition from the Poisson distribution
v = 0 to the Wigner surmise v = 1 with increasing BIA. Similar results
were found by Haller, Koeppel, and Cederbaum (1984) for two harmonic oscillators coupled by a fourth-order term in the position coordinates.
Seligman, Verbaarschot, and Zirnbauer (1984 and 1985) investigate a more elaborate coupling between two non-linear oscillators;
they work out both the rigidity "Ll3 and the spacing P(x) as a function
of the coupling strength. The spacings are fitted with a modified
Gaussian ensemble of random matrices: the off-diagonal matrix elements ~k in the ensemble are subject to a cut-off factor
exp( - U- k) 2 I a 2 ). Poisson statistics requires a = 0, whereas a = oc
for GOE. There is a smooth transition from a=O to a::: 1, as the coupling strength increases.
As a last example, we mention the work of Ishikawa and Yukawa
( 1985a and b) who study the billiard in the oval given by
r = ro( 1 + cos 2cp) in polar coordinates. The eigenfunctions are expanded in the Bessel functions Jn(kr) exp(incp) where E = ll 2 k 2 12m,
so that the matrix elements M 1n(k) can be expressed analytically. The
authors compute a great many different statistical measures, including
the ones discussed above; they also calculate Lyapounoff exponents
(cf. Section 1.6) and the resulting entropy, i.e., the average over (10.6)
for many different classical trajectories. The qualitative conclusions
remain the same as in the previous examples.
Berry and Robnik ( 1984) pointed out a peculiar difficulty that affects the numerical results in this section. As long as the classical system is not fully ergodic, i.e., a typical trajectory does not go through the
whole energy surface, the phase space is divided into distinct parts,
which do not communicate classically. Experience with the Wigner
distribution functions (cf. Section 15.4) shows that the highly excited

278

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

eigenfunctions respect this classical break-up of phase space; such a
dynamically isolated region may be integrable, or nearly integrable, i.e.,
be covered with many remaining KAM tori; or it may be fully ergodic,
but separated from another fully ergodic region by a last KAM torus;
or finally the most common case, two regions may belong to different
exact symmetries in the Hamiltonian, and such symmetries divide the
spectrum into two entirely independent parts.
In all these cases, each dynamically distinct region of phase space
contributes a set of energy levels with its own statistics, such as Poisson
or GOE; but the superposition of two or more such independent contributions makes the result look as if the energy levels were totally uncorrelated. E.g., the existence of a single KAM torus may have the
effect of faking a Poisson distribution for the spacing P(x). Spectral
statistics has to be viewed with great caution and has to be supplemented with a careful examination of the classical system. But even
then, it may be hard to separate the parts of the spectrum that one may
vaguely attribute to one or the other region of phase space. Further
analysis along these lines is presented by Wintgen and Friedrich
(1987a) and by Honig and Wintgen (1989).

16.9 Classical Chaos and Quantal Random Matrices
If the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) is assumed, precise

statements about the statistical nature of the spectrum can be made,
some of which are confirmed to an unexpected degree of accuracy in
Hamiltonian systems with classical chaos, as shown in Section 16.6.
Can we understand this empirical result?
Two kinds of explanations have been offered so far: the first gives
an argument like that of Berry and Tabor in Section 16.5 where at some
crucial moment an explicit statement about the classical behavior is
used and is then transformed into a precise statistical proposition, e.g.,
the regular grid in the space of classical actions yields the Poisson distribution for the spacings. The second kind of explanation is more intuitive and general, but gives no more than a vague connection between
a particular symptom of classical chaos and some characteristic feature
of the spectrum.
The first kind is clearly preferable in the long run, but the only
useful approach so far for classically chaotic systems is due to Berry
(1985). It will be discussed in the next chapter, because it starts with
the trace formula; it ends up calculating the rigidity, and yields the
same value ( 16.11) as the GOE. The physics is hidden in a sum rule

16.9 Classical Chaos and Quanta! Random Matrices

due to Hannay and Ozorio de Almeida (1984), whose analog for
integrable systems is responsible for the result of Berry and Tabor (cf.
Section 16.5). Work by Balazs and Voros (1987) involving the zetafunction is of the same kind. Progress along this direction is badly
needed.
Zaslavski ( 1977) also starts from the trace formula; he gets a rather
explicit expression for the spacing probability P(x) which involves the
Kolmogoroff entropy, basically the average of (10.6) over the energy
surface. Such a relation would be very desirable; but Casati, Valz-Gris,
and Guarneri ( 1980) see no evidence for such a direct connection in
their calculation of eigenvalues for the stadium. Ishikawa and Yukawa
( 1985a and b) correlate the entropy directly with the parameter v in the
spacing distribution (16.17), but they make no effort to explain their
result quantitatively.
A more formal argument is given by Alhassid and Levine (1986)
who consider the transition strengths of a quantum system; y = Ix
where x = < f IT I i > is the transition amplitude from the initial state
i to the final state f through the observable T. The aim is to find the
most likely distribution of Q(x)dx, given the sum rule to be obeyed by
the transition strengths, such as the sum over the final states
L I <fIT Ii > 12 = < i IT+T il>. The likelihood for a particular distribution Q(x) is defined in terms of its 'entropy',
f dx Q(x) logQ(x), which is then minimized under the constraint of the
sum-rule. Additional constraints to limit the spread of the transition
strengths from their mean eventually lead to distributions similar to
(16.20). A related argument is advanced by Wilkinson (1988) who
thinks of the matrix elements in the quantum Hamiltonian as executing
a random walk as a function of the perturbation.
The distribution P(x) of the level spacings in chaotic systems is
narrowly peaked, because level crossings are avoided as the strength of
the coupling between different degrees of freedom increases. Presumably, since the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian don't have any
simple pattern, their overlap integrals don't vanish, and degeneracies
are avoided. The energy levels try to stay away from one another as
best they can, and thereby account for the strong peak in P(x) at
x = 1. Gomez, Zakrzewski, Taylor, and Kulander (1989) illustrate
this point with examples such as the hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field, as well as the molecule Hf. Heiss and Sannino ( 1989)
consider quite generally the orientation of the eigenvectors in Hilbert
space, and their rotation as function of the perturbation parameters, to
explain the level repulsion.
Graffi, Paul, and Silverstone ( 1986) have related this phenomenon
directly to the overlap of classical resonances that was discussed in

f

280

The Energy Spectrum of a Classically Chaotic System

and applied this argument to a time-dependent
Section 9.4,
Hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom; but further work is
needed to explain avoided crossings in conservative chaotic examples.
Reichl and Lin (1986), as well as Lin and Reichl (1987 and 1988) have
worked out the idea of a quantum-resonanc e overlap to explain the
transition from regular to irregular spectra, and related manifestations
of chaotic behavior in quantum systems; but their examples are timedependent and one-dimensional, and will not be discussed here.
The idea that the overlap between many different states leads to a
GOE type spectrum has been formalized by Pechukas (1983); his
method was further developed by Yukawa (1985). We will follow the
latter. The Hamiltonian is written asH= H 0 +tV, where H 0 belongs
to an integrable system, and V is the coupling whose strength t increases from 0 as if it were the time. The eigenvalues of Hare x11 (t),
and the corresponding eigenfunctions are cf> 11 (t). The matrix elements
for the perturbation are Vmn(t) = < cf>m(t) I Vlcf>n(t) >. These quantities are shown by simple differentiation (perturbation theory) to satisfy
a number of 'equations of motion',

There are infinitely many 'constants of motion', because increasing the
coupling parameter t generates an orthogonal transformation in the
Hilbert space whose invariants, like the trace of various operators, stay
the same. Indeed, Nakamura and Lakshaman (1986) have shown that
the system ( 16.22) is completely integrable.

16.9 Classical Chaos and Quanta! Random Matrices

281

The problem is now shifted toward understanding a classical dynamical system of infinitely many degrees of freedom with as many
constants of motion. One could resort to statistical mechanics, and
consider a stationary distribution ( 1I Z)exp( - f3E - yQ) where Z is
the normalization constant, alias partition function. The 'inverse temperature' f3 and the 'chemical potential' y can be determined by prescribing the mean values Eo = < E > and Q0 = < Q >.
The
variables Pn and fnm are integrated out, so as to yield the distribution for
the eigenvalues Xn of the Hamiltonian H. The result is exactly the
probability distribution (16.8) for the eigenvalues in the GOE, and one
is tempted to recognize a mathematical justification for the random
matrix model; but the GOE now appears to be almost too generally
applicable to be of much value in the characterization of chaotic features in quantum mechanics.

CHAPTER 17

The Trace Fonnula

The main topic of this chapter gets its name from a spiritual ancestor,
the Selberg Trace Formula, which was discovered by the Norwegian
mathematician Atle Selberg in the 1950s. Whereas the original trace
formula claims the numerical equality of two rather unequal-looking
functions, the descendant makes this claim only in the limit of Planck's
quantum going to zero, or equivalently, in the limit of a wavelength
small compared to the size of the container. While the degree of validity for the new formula has been reduced, its domain of application
has been greatly enlarged.
Instead of a well-defined and crisp formula, we now have a basic
approach to making a connection between a function of time or of energy computed in quantum mechanics, on the left-hand side of the c=
sign, and another such function calculated in classical mechanics on the
right-hand side. The exact formal expressions on the right depend
somewhat on the behavior of the classical dynamical system, whether
regular, softly, or harshly chaotic; but the left side is independent of
this classical predicament. The main idea is to use the knowledge of the
classical behavior to compute the right-hand side, and then switch sides
so as to draw conclusions about the quantum mechanics of the system.
The author was the first to devise this general scheme (Gutzwiller
1970 and 1971) as a way to answer Einstein's question: how can classical mechanics give us any hints about the quantum-mechanical energy
levels when the classical system is ergodic? Similar issues were addressed by Balian and Bloch (1972 and 1974), although in the somewhat reduced context of waves inside a cavity; Colin de Verdiere
( 1973) and Chazarain ( 197 4) established the exact mathematical propositions for the free motion of a particle on a Riemannian surface;
Berry and Mount (1972) wrote an early review of the field. Dashen,
Hasslacher, and Neveu (1974) were the first to apply the main ideas
to high-energy physics.
The trace formula and its variants rely on the knowledge of the
classical periodic orbits, in order to understand the quanta! spectrum.
This approach has seen a number of significant accomplishments:

The Trace Formula

283

among others, the energy levels have actually been calculated in this
manner for the Anisotropic Kepler Problem (Gutzwiller 1980 and
1982), a system with hard chaos (cf. Chapter 11); the level repulsion
in the spectrum of a classically chaotic system was explained on this
basis by Berry (1985); and perhaps the most important, and satisfying
for both experimental and theoretical physicists, the correlations in the
spectrum of hydrogen in a strong magnetic field near the ionization
threshold has been reduced to a set of classical periodic orbits (cf.
18.6). Considering the scope of these ideas, the present chapter can
only provide some general guidance to the perplexed who are not used
to thinking in terms of periodic orbits.

17.1 The Van Vleck Formula Revisited
Van Vleck's formula (12.20), and its obvious generalization
(12.25), gives the classical approximation Kc(q11 q1t) to the quantummechanical propagator K(q" q' t). No effort was made in Section 12.5
to prove this fact; it was only shown that the convolution formula
(12.22) holds, provided the integral is evaluated by the stationary
phase method, and the phase loss of 'fT /2 at a conjugate point is taken
into account.
The discussion in Section 13.6 was designed to convince the reader
that the path integral (13 .14) for K(q", q', t) can be worked out in the
neighborhood of a classical trajectory, if we take only the second variation into account. The corresponding integral over these quadratic
fluctuations yields exactly the Van Vleck expression.
Another, more straightfroward argument comes from inserting
(12.20) directly into (13.4). The right-hand side does not vanish any
longer; but it can be written in a fairly compact form, after some nontrivial rearrangements of the terms. The calculation can just as well
be done with the general expression (13.2) for the kinetic energy operator in a Riemannian space. The resulting right-hand side of (13.4)
becomes

t? 1- (~" 1(;) K( II It)
2m JC V '-- c q q ,

(17.1)

/C"

in the Van
where the Laplacian acts only on the amplitude factor
Vleck propagator Kc(q'' q1 t).
The factor of Kc in ( 17.1) depends not only on q11 , but also on q1 and
t ; although it contains second derivatives with respect to q", its variation is independent of li, except for the factor 11 2 /2m in front. Thus

284

The Trace Formula

the whole right-hand side (17 .1) can be interpreted as an extra potential energy, comparable to V(q") on the left, but whose value is proportional to li 2 . Therefore, as Planck's quantum goes to 0, the classical
propagator Kc tends toward a solution of Schrodinger's equation
(13.4).
Green's function G(q" q' E) is obtained from the propagator
K(q" q' t) through the Fourier-Laplace transform (12.27) with respect
to the time. It transforms all other quantities from the time domain into
the energy domain, e.g., Kc goes into Gc. provided the stationary phase
method is used consistently. The right-hand side of the inhomogeneous
Schrodinger equation ( 13.11) acquires a term exactly as ( 17.1), with
D and Gc replacing C and Kc.
The ideal use of the sums over the classical trajectories, (12.25) for
Kc and (12.28)for Gc, would be to transform either one into a form
resembling as closely as possible (13.9) forK and (13.10) for G. The
author was able to carry out this program in the exceptional case of the
bound states for the hydrogen atom, in momentum rather than position coordinates (cf. Section 12.8). Although the expression (12.31) is not
the correct Green's function in momentum space, it has only poles for
the real part of E < 0; they are at the right place, and have the correct
residues.
The same kind of calculation was also carried out for the bound
states in a more difficult, but still separable problem. The pure
Coulomb potential was replaced by a spherically symmetric, screened
electrostatic field (Gutzwiller 1969).
The trajectory from
q' = (r', 81 ) to q" = (r", 8") lies on an invariant torus in phase space
that is characterized by the total angular momentum L and the energy
E. When projected into position space, the invariant torus has to cover
the starting point q' and the end point q"; at fixed E, the angular momentum L can vary only over a limited range.
The detailed construction of the possible trajectories is typical for
integrable systems with more degrees of freedom. Each trajectory between the fixed endpoints is characterized by two integers, v to count
the complete circuits between extremal points in the radial direction,
and X for each completion of 27T in the angular motion. The angle
around the origin increases by 27T + y when the radial distance r goes
through one cycle between the extremal values, r 1 < r2 , as in the discussion of Section 6.1. For the screened Coulomb potential, y > 0,
yielding a precession of the trajectories (by contrast, Figure 10 shows
the situation for y < 0, called regression of the orbit). The angle y is
not a simple function of E and L, however, since it vanishes for sufficiently large values of L when the trajectory stays completely on the
outside or on the inside of the screening cloud.

17.1 The Van Vleck Formula Revisited

285

The angle a covered before reaching the extremum r2 for the first
time, and the angle {3 after the last passage through rz must be computed; the details are worked out in the paper mentioned above. Given
the energy E, the angular momentum Lis fixed by the ratio A./v, with
some minor adjustments to accommodate the start and the finish of the
trajectory. Both the action integral S and the amplitude l'fJ must be
calculated for each trajectory.
As in Section 16.5, but moving in the opposite direction, the two
summations, over v and over A., are now transformed with the help of
Poisson's formula (16.13); the new integer variables are called n and
f. A pole is associated with each admissible pair (n, f), and its residue
is a product of two wave functions; the angular part of each is the
classical approximation to the Legendre function of order f, while the
radial part is the usual WKB approximation for the n-th radial
eigenfunction in the assumed potential and the given angular momentum (f + 1/2)1L The half-integer for the angular momentum can be
directly traced back to the count of conjugate points; it would be an
integer, if the problem had been treated in two dimensions.
The classical Green's function is, therefore, shown to yield the usual
approximation to the spectrum, as well as the wave functions, for
integrable systems. Nothing new has been achieved beyond the results
of Section 14.1 and 14.2; but we can now move forward into the unknown territory of chaotic dynamical systems, with the full assurance
that our method works well in all the cases that have been treated so
far without the benefit of Van Vleck's formula for Kc and its offshoot
Gc.

17.2 The Classical Green's Function in Action-Angle Variables
The classical Green's function Gc was explained in the preceding section, and hints were given toward its explicit calculation, for a particle
in a spherically symmetric potential. The motion was separated into a
radial and an angular component, but action-angle variables were not
used. As mentioned already in Section 6.1, they are artificial, because
they vary linearly with time, and perhaps more significantly, they are
not directly accessible to measurement. The four angular variables in
the three-body problem, e.g., Moon-Earth-Sun, can be associated with
the four angles that define the relative positions in the system as described in Section 4.4; but making the connection between the real and
the artificial angles is the main job of celestial mechanics, and it is very
difficult.

286

The Trace Formula

Nevertheless, the action-angle formalism is helpful when discussing
the general properties of integrable systems. Therefore, we will assume
in this section that the canonical transformation from the physical coordinates in phase space to the action-angle variables has been completed. The Hamiltonian is given by the function H(ft, ... ,If) as
explained in Section 3.3. The starting point of a trajectory is given by
the angles w' 1, ... , w'f , and the endpoint by the angles w" 1, ... , w"f . In
order to compute the time elapsed t, the energy E has to be specified;
then, a relatively tricky procedure is necessary to determine the actions

(3.3) tells us that Wj = oH/ oi.J; the direction of the normal to the
surface of constant energy E in action space is defined thereby. If we
assume, as always in these dicussions, that the determinant of the second derivatives o2H/oi.J oh does not vanish, the direction of the
normal will uniquely specify the point on the energy surface. The
action integralS= ft(w"t- w't) + ... +Ij(w"f- w1f) can then be
calculated to provide the exponent in the classical Green's function
(12.28).
The amplitude requires the second derivatives of the action S with
respect to w", w', and E. If we set WJ = w"1 - w'J , the second derivatives with respect to ware just as good. For the first derivatives, the
same argument that leads from (6.5) to (6.6), now yields
8(ft w1 + ·· · + I fWf) = I 18w1 + ·· · + If 8wf. The next derivative is
more complicated, because a change 8wJ entails both a change 8wk in
all the frequencies and a change 8t in the time elapsed, as the energy
stays fixed at E. If the derivative is taken with respect to E for constant
w's, however, the products wJ t have to remain fixed, while E varies.
Although these operations are not difficult, they require close attention; the author has found the function F(wi. ... , Wf) useful, which
was defined in connection with formula (14.15) and is the dual of the
Hamiltonian H(ft, ... ,If). The determinant D of (2.7) becomes
( -l)f + 1 det(F1'k)
D(w" w' E) =
(17.2)
where the indices on F indicate derivatives with respect to the frequencies w. The matrix of the second derivatives of F is the inverse of
the matrix of the second derivatives of H. If we use local coordinates
in the action space, as in Section 16.5, so that the direction of the
normal to the energy surface becomes the It -axis, (17 .2) reduces to
( -1 )f + 1 It f- 1 det' (Hjk)' where the prime on the determinant

where the phase <f> counts all the phase losses of 'IT /2 along the trajectory. As a rule, each increase of one of the angles w by 'IT implies a
well-defined number of conjugate points.
The classical trajectories in (17.3) can be visualized in ani-dimensional space of coordinates Wt. ..• , Wf similar to Figure 19. A rectangular grid of of cells is defined by the points whose coordinates are the
multiples of 2'1T; the starting point w' is put into the first cell of the
'positive quadrant'. The endpoint w" has a representative in each cell
of the grid; it is obtained by adding a multiple of 2'1T to one of the
components of w". The straight line connecting w' with one of the
w11 's represents a trajectory; its slope gives the direction of the frequency vector (wt. ... , w1), or equivalently, the direction of the normal
to the energy surface H(l) = E in the action space. Each cell is numbered by f integers ranging from - oo to +oo. Thus, the trajectories in
(17 .3) are characterized by an f-tupel of integers, exactly as the trajectories in the spherically symmetric potential of the preceding section
were numbered by the two integers v and 'A.
The classical Green's function (17 .3) is related to the quantummechanical expression (13 .1 0), but the correspondence between the
two expressions is not obvious. As we will show shortly, even the
motion of a particle in a square with periodic boundary conditions leads
to serious discrepancies between the classical and the quantummechanical Green's functions.

17.3 The Trace Formula for Integrable Systems
Since the full-fledged summation over all classical trajectories from the
starting point q' to the endpoint q" is so difficult to evaluate, we will
settle for considerably less. The trace in (13.10) is taken, namely
g(E)

well, if we use the decomposition

8(E- E) (17.6)

where e > 0. This form of the trace is sometimes more convenient
because the integral over q in (17 .4) may diverge for small q when G
is replaced by Gc.
In taking the trace of (17. 3), the endpoint w" is identified with the
starting point w', modulo 2'TT in every component. Therefore, we have
w"1 - w'1 = 2'TTM_j, where M1 can be any integer. The integral is taken
over the starting point, which is then allowed to sample the whole invariant torus by roaming through the first cell of the grid in w-space.
The integrand does not depend on w' as long as w" stays always the
same multiples of 2'TT away from w'. The corresponding trajectories are
periodic orbits that wind around the invariant torus M 1 times in the w1
coordinate.
The integral over w' contributes a factor (2'TT )f to (17 .3); the time t
in ( 17.3) is the period of the periodic orbit, and its frequency is,
therefore, w0 = 2'TT/t. With these minor manipulations, and remembering (17.6), the trace of (17.3) becomes identical with (16.16), at
least as far as the terms with M #:- 0 are concerned.
Since the original formula (12.28) is applicable for any pair of
points q" and q', there is naturally a term where q" - q' when the trace
is calculated. For that exceptional term, it is necessary to expand Gc
in powers of Iq" - q' I with the help of (2.5). The Green's function
is singular, however, and special tricks are necessary in order to obtain
a finite expression; e.g., the difference between the Green's function
and its complex conjugate is used, exactly as in (17 .6). This exceptional term in (12.28) leads to Weyl's formula for the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues; indeed, it is involved in the argument of
Mark Kac, which we sketched in Section 16.2. All further discussion
will deal only with the terms with M #:- 0 which are responsible for the
fluctuations in the spectrum.
The formula (16.16) has, therefore, been derived from the trace of
(17 .3 ), which in turn resulted from the classical Green's function
(12.28). Does the expression (16.16) indeed have 8-function like
singularities with respect to the energy? We could simply backtrack
from (16.16) through (16.14) to (16.12); a stationary-phase integral

17.3 The Trace Formula for Integrable Systems

289

has to be 'inverted', i.e., each term in (16.16) is recognized as the result
of a stationary-phase evaluation of the corresponding term in (16.14).
More directly, however, we can ask why there would be any
singularities in the sum over periodic orbits ( 16.16) as a function of the
energy E. Let us consider contiguous terms, i.e., two terms where only
one of the integers M1 is different, and differs only by 1. Constructive
interference takes place when the difference between the exponents
2'7Ti(M, 10 ) I 11 is a multiple of 2'7Ti. The change in the action S is given
by (6.6) in the limit of large integers M; constructive interference between contiguous terms requires, therefore, that each action Ik be a
multiple of 11, exactly as in the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization (14.1).
Had we included the count of conjugate points and the consequent
phase-loss in the derivation of (16.16) from the trace of Gc. i.e., had
we started from (17.3), this simple criterion would have yielded the
quantization condition (14.4), including the Maslov indices.
The author (Gutzwiller 1970) has investigated more closely how the
classical trace, i.e., the trace calculated from the classical Green's
function, depends on E in a number of simple integrable systems. As
pointed out in Chapter 12, Van Vleck's formula (12.20) gives the exact
quantum-mechani cal propagator for the free particle in three dimensions (12.21), and the stationary-phase method in the Fourier integral
(12.27) gives the same result (12.29) as the exact integration over
time. Therefore, the classical trace coincides with the exact trace for
the three-dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions. The
Cartesian coordinates q are the angle variables in this case, and the
formula (17.3) represents no more than the method of images in the
solution of Schrodinger's equation. The boundary conditions are enforced by matching each source with its image upon reflection on one
of the edges.
The two-dimensional box, however, does not work out so well, because the expression for Gc does no longer coincide with the solution
of the inhomogeneous Schrodinger equation (13.11) for the free particle. Gc is only the asymptotic form for large distances Iq" - q' I,
whereas the exact solution is a Bessel function. The method of images
is still applicable, however, and is expressed in (17 .3 ). The classical
density of states, as computed from (17.6) with (16.16), shows not
only 8-functions in the energy at the correct places, but also a continuous part whose average is 0. Thus, even in the mos.t favorable cases,
the classical trace may contain some very unphysical parts.
Rather than to start from the classical trace as the author did,
Keating and Berry (1987) started from the expression (16.12), and
inserted the expression for the energy levels in a rectangle, the same
as used by Casati et al. (1985; cf. Section 16.6). The number of states

290

The Trace Formula

below E, N(E) = f E p(E) dE, can be transformed by Poisson's formula
(16.13). The resulting exact expression, obtained without the help of
the stationary-phase method, can still be interpreted as a sum over periodic orbits. Each term has a spurious singularity, however, and one
could be fooled if the infinite sum is truncated too early; but upon
carrying the summation far enough, these false singularities disappear,
and the steps in the function N(E) appear rather miraculously at the
right places.
In both of these two elementary examples the particle moves in a
domain that can be made to tile or pave the infinite Cartesian space, i.e.,
copies of the domain are obtained by translation or other symmetry
operations, and they cover completely the infinite space without overlap; Keller and Rubinow (1960) have given other, non-trivial examples. This common feature allows Schrodinger's equation to be solved
by the method of images: Green's function for the domain is obtained
from Green's function for the whole space by taking the sum over all
the copies of either the starting point or the endpoint. That is exactly
the content of (17.3). Difficulties arise, however, if Green's function
for the open space is approximated, as in the two-dimensional
Cartesian space where the Bessel function was replaced by its
asymptotic expansion.
There are remarkable cases where the classical approximation to the
trace still gives the correct quantum-mechanical result, although the
classical Green's function Gc differs from the quantum-mechanical G.
Selberg's trace formula in two dimensions, for the spectrum of a particle on a surface of constant negative curvature, belongs to this category; its derivation, however, is no more than an application of the
method of images (cf. Section 19.5). To compound the mystery further, Gc coincides with G in the three-dimensional hyperbolic space,
just as Gc in three-dimensional Cartesian space is given by (12.29)
which happens to be the solution of the inhomogeneous Schrodinger
equation (13.11) for V(q) = 0.

17.4 The Trace Formula in Chaotic Dynamical Systems
Van Vleck's formula (12.20) and its offsprings, in particular the classical Green's function Gc in (12.28), are assumed to be valid approximations for chaotic Hamiltonian systems. The difficulty now lies in
finding all the classical trajectories from the starting point q1 to the
endpoint q", either in the given time t or at the given energy E, for a
chaotic dynamical system. Apparently, nobody has made sufficient
progress in this problem to publish any results. The construction of
quasiclassical wave functions, starting either from the classical
propagator Kc or from Green's function Gc, seems out of the question
for the time being.
The next best thing is to take the trace, say of Gc; this process is now
quite different from the calculation in the preceding section. Each term
in the sum over classical trajectories is treated separately and remains
separate in all the further developments. There is no simple way to
compare different trajectories, as in the preceding section where the
notion of contiguous orbits was used. The presence of sharp spikes,
like 8-functions in the density of states p(E), will remain a problem
without a general solution. The final result, called the trace formula,
can only be tested in special examples like the Anisotropic Kepler
Problem. These preliminary remarks are meant to put the rest of this
chapter into perspective, and to help the reader spot areas where
progress can be made.
The general argument was given by the author (Gutzwiller 1971),
and we will follow his development fairly closely; Littlejohn (1990)
gives a more general approach using Lagrangian manifolds. Most of
the formal manipulations have already been carried out in the earlier
chapters, so that we are left with relatively little tedious work at this
point. Let us call gc(E) the integral ( 17.4), where G has been replaced
by Gc as defined in (12.28). The starting point q' and the endpoint q11
coincide in the integrand, q" = q' = q , i.e., if we pick any particular
term in the sum over the classical trajectories, that trajectory has to
close. There is no need, however, for the trajectory to close smoothly;
the starting momentum p' may be different from the final momentum

"

p.

The integration in ( 17.4) requires that the common starting and
endpoint q vary continuously over all of the position space that is accessible at the stipulated energy E. The particular trajectory gets deformed thereby in a continuous manner, but it maintains its basic
shape. In the spirit of the stationary-phase method, the variation of the
exponent i S(q" q' E)/li, as the point q" = q' = q varies, is now of
crucial importance.

292

The Trace Formula

The formula (2.4) gives the derivatives of the actionS with respect
to q" and q'; therefore,

= p"- p'.(17.7)

If the trajectory does not close smoothly, i.e., p" :F p', the integration
over q tends to reduce the term by the destructive interference between
trajectories of the same kind, provided the action integrals S vary as
much as 2'1Th. If the trajectory closes smoothly, however, i.e.,p'' = p',
the contributions from different starting = end points q add up in
phase. Thus, the calculation of the trace Kc(E) is reduced to a summation
over all periodic orbits.

Each term in the sum (12.28) or (12.25) is now characterized by a
particular periodic orbit. Contrary to the situation in an integrable
system, the only parameter that can be varied continuously while
holding on to this special orbit, is either the energy E or the time t, to
be called the period from now on. The periodic orbit is isolated.
The integration over q will be carried out for a system with three
degrees of freedom, as in the discussion of periodic orbits of Sections
6.3 and 6.4; all the basic features are already present in this special
case. We use the results of Chapter 7 on the surface of section, to
construct a special system of canonical coordinates. The coordinate
q1 runs along the particular periodic orbit, while q2 and q3 belong to the
surfaces of section, which are always transverse to the periodic orbit.
For convenience, the origin for the coordinates (q2 , q3 ) in each surface
of section is the intersection with the periodic orbit.
As long as (q2 , q3 ) = 0, the action integral S(q q E) keeps the same
value S(E), independent of q1. When (q2 , q3 ) :F 0, however, the closed
trajectory is no longer a periodic orbit. Its action integral gets a correction to second order,
1
a2 s
2 < oq" oq"
where q = (q 1 , 0, 0) and ~q = (0, ~q2 , ~q3 ); the summation over the
indices 2 and 3 is implied.
The integration over q2 and q3 is done by stationary phase; only the
variation in the phase is important, while the amplitude is computed
on the periodic orbit. With the help of (12.23) and (12.24), the integral over q2 and q3 becomes

where the double signs refer to the eigenvalues of the quadratic form
in (17.8), and the prime on the determinant reminds the reader that
only the derivatives with respect to the variables 2 and 3 are involved.
The integration over q1 now becomes relatively simple. The action
integral S(q q E) does not depend on q1 ; we are left with the amplitude
in (12.28), i.e., the determinant D(q" q' E) of (2.7). It is simplified
with the help of the same argument that led to (2.9); take the derivative
of (2.8) with respect toE, keeping q'' constant; then notice that in our
special coordinates ()H/ op = q = (I 4tl, 0, 0). As in (2.10), we have

The expression (17 .9) and the square root of D from (17 .11) are
now combined to yield the integrand for the integration over q 1, i.e.,
along the periodic orbit. If we go through Section 6.3 and 6.4, we find
that the result can be expressed directly in terms of the function F(A.),
which is defined by (6.11). Actually, we need its value for A. = 1,
which becomes
- 4 Sinh 2 (x/2) for a direct hyperbolic orbit ,
0 for a direct parabolic orbit ,
F(l) = 4 sin 2 (x/2) for an elliptic orbit,
(17.12)
4 for an inverse parabolic orbit ,
4 Cosh 2 (x/2) for an inverse hyperbolic orbit,
for each degree of freedom transverse to the periodic orbit. We have
omitted the loxodromic case because no example will be mentioned in
this book. Notice that the possible values of F(l) range continuously
from - oo to + oo; they are the residues in the work of Greene (1979),
as mentioned in Sections 6.4 and 9.8.
Elliptic periodic orbits are very important in systems with soft chaos
where we have to deal with small islands of stability; an interpretation
of this phenomenon due to Miller ( 197 5) will be discussed in Section
6. Direct parabolic periodic orbits are the hallmark of integrable sys-

294

The Trace Formula

terns; F(1) = 0 indicates that the periodic orbit is not isolated, because
the square-root ofF( 1) goes into the denominator of the integrand.
The two hyperbolic cases are characteristic of hard chaos, but they
occur in soft chaos as well. Indeed, if anything, they are typical of
chaotic systems, and our discussion will be focused on them. Our two
prime examples, the anisotropic Kepler problem and the motion on a
surface of constant negative curvature, have only direct hyperbolic orbits.
The integral along the periodic orbit, over q1, now becomes easy;
the only quantity in the integrand depending on q1 is the velocity I q I
in the denominator. Although the orbit may consist of the system going
around it more than once, the integral arises from integrating the trace
over all position space; every point should be covered only once.
Therefore, Jdq 1I I q I is the simple (primitive) period, to be called To
from now on, in contrast to the full period Tor the action integral S,
which may be multiples of the corresponding primitive quantities.
Conjugate points are associated with a change in sign of
D(q" q' E); their effect is contained in the multiple signs (17.9). Since
all our examples have two degrees of freedom, the discussion will be
restricted to this case. We assume that an odd number of conjugate
points in a hyperbolic orbit leads to the inverse hyperbolic case of
(17.12); the only change in the formula below is then to replace
Sinh(x/2) by Cosh(x/2). In this connection, it is comforting to know
that according to Littlejohn (private communication) the number of
conjugate points always increases with time, provided the kinetic energy as a function of the momentum is positive definite.
As in the transition from the classical propagator Kc to the classical
Green's function Gc in Section 12.7, the count of conjugate points may
change by 1 in going from Gc to gc. A careful discussion of the multiple
signs in (17.9) shows the following: the stable (or unstable) manifold
rotates in phase space by a multiple of 'TT, before closing the periodic
orbit. This multiple f is most easily recognized by the number of times
the stable manifold is 'vertical', i.e., oriented in the local p-direction ( cf.
Creagh, Robbins, and Littlejohn 1990).
Putting all the pieces together then yields the trace formula: the
classical approximation gc(E) to the quantum-mechanical trace g(E) is
given by the sum over the periodic orbits (po),

Each term in the sum over periodic orbits consists of a coefficient

the periodic orbit, are continuous functions of the energy E. As in the
integrable case (16 .16), the superposition of these smooth classical
functions of E is expected to yield at least an approximate spectrum for
the quantum-mechanical energy levels.
The mode of reasoning in this section has been extended by several
authors to quantum-mechanical objects of a more complicated type,
which can still be reduced to a trace with the propagator or Green's
function. Indeed, one could think of f d fq" d fq' F(q' q'') G(q" q' E),
where F is the kernel of some Hermitian operator. When Green's
function is replaced by its classical form (12.28), and the integration
is carried out by stationary phase, closed classical trajectories are
bound to arise quite naturally, although the exact kind of closure will
depend on the operator F and its classical analog. Wilkinson (1987)
has discussed some of the details; the important application of this idea
will come up in the next chapter, in connection with the transition matrix elements in optical emission or absorption.

17.5 The Mathematical Foundations of the Trace Formula
The trace formula for classically chaotic Hamiltonian systems seems to
be the only general tool available at this time to establish a quantitative
connection between the classical and the quantal regime. Before trying
to use this tool, however, we have to gain trust in its reliability. The
classical trace &(E), as written down in formula (17.13), has to be
understood more clearly as the limit for small Planck's quantum of the
quantum-mechanical trace (17 .4).
This section will offer, therefore, various comments on research
concerning the trace formula that appeared shortly after the author's
publication of the results in the preceding section. Most of the work
to be reported was done quite independently, and reflects slightly different interests and intentions, although the results are all closely related to one another.
Section 16.2 toward the end mentioned the results of Balian and
Bloch to derive higher-order corrections to Weyl's formula. The third
installment of their work (Balian and Bloch 1972) uses the same approach as the two earlier ones; but now, formulas for the fluctuations
in the spectrum are obtained which depend on finding the classical periodic orbits, just like (16.16) and (17.13). The argument is quite different, however, and well worth considering.
The propagation of waves inside a cavity is reduced to multiple reflections: a spherical wave is 'started' in the interior at q' at a given

296

The Trace Formula

energy E with the wave function (12.29), which is the correct Green's
function for a free particle in three dimensions. When this original
wave reaches the boundary, a reflected wave gets superimposed whose
form-is again (12.29); but the starting point q' is at the boundary, and
the amplitude depends on the value of the original wave as it reaches
the boundary, as well as on the stipulated boundary conditions. The
reflected wave generates a second-generation reflected wave in exactly
the same way the original wave caused the first-generation reflection,
and so on.
This manner of speaking, as if the consecutive reflections were following one another in time, is only valid by analogy. The fixed energy
E is, of course, equivalent to a fixed frequency, and all the reflected
waves form a permanent superposition for all times. If E is made
complex by adding a positive imaginary part, i.e., E -+ E + ie, the amplitude (12.29) decays exponentially with the distance I q11 - q' I, and
the consecutive reflections get weaker. The expansion in multiple reflections converges and can be broken off at some convenient order
depending on the value of li/ v2me compared to the size of the cavity.
This argument of Balian and Bloch for e > 0 is very similar to the discussion in Section 16.2, and leads to the smoothed-out spectrum, i.e.,
Weyl's formula and its extensions.
In order to get the fluctuations, however, e has to be reduced below
a critical value, and all the higher-order reflections have to be included
when writing down Green's function for the cavity. The trace g(E) in
(17 .4) now becomes a sum over all closed sequences of straight-line
trajectories, bouncing off the walls of the cavity. Each term has an
exponential factor, exp[i v2mE (rol + r12 + ... + rno)/li], where
rjJ + 1 is the distance between the j-th and the (j + 1)-th reflection
points on the walls, and the index 0 refers to the arbitrary starting =
end point. The integration over these n + 1 points is now done by
stationary phase and leads to the periodic orbits.
The geometrical details are worked out much more explicitly than
The
the rather formal discussions of the preceding section.
parallelepiped and the sphere are done in closed form, to nobody's
surprise, since they are integrable; but no chaotic systems are treated
in detail. In a subsequent paper, Balian and Bloch (1974) discuss
Schrodinger's equation using the same idea of multiple reflections by
starting from the integral equation for Green's function in terms of
Green's function for the free particle.
The program of Balian and Bloch was carried out by Berry ( 1981)
for Sinai's billiard (cf. Section 10.3). He first calculated the quantummechanical spectrum using the Kohn-Korringa-Rostoker method from
solid-state physics. The bounded region is translated so as to cover the

17.5 Mathematical Foundations of the Trace Formula

297

whole plane, and Schrodinger's equation is then solved as a multiplescattering problem in the resulting infinite grid. Berry was able to rearrange the final expression for the density of states so as to make it
look exactly like the multiple reflections from the boundary of original
domain.
Selberg's trace formula (cf. Chapter 19) is essentially equivalent to
the statement that Kc(E) as given by ( 17.13) is equal to the trace
(17 .4), for the motion of a particle on a compact surface of constant
negative curvature. The proof relies on the high degree of symmetry
of such surfaces, as does Berry's use of multiple scattering in the Sinai
billiard (cf. Section 16.7). Colin de Verdiere (1973) is probably the
first mathematician to prove a theorem similar to ( 17.13) in a case
where the symmetry arguments cannot be used. He still needs a compact surface of (non-constant) negative curvature, however, and he
derives his theorem for the heat equation, i.e., he replaces the time t in
Schrodinger's equation by a negative imaginary quantity -iT as in the
discussion of Section 16.2.
In a second paper, Colin de Verdiere (1973) proves a proposition
like ( 17.13) for the motion on a compact Riemannian surface without
any strong assumption about its curvature; the price for this new result,
however, is a rather subtle condition concerning the asymptotic relation between g(E) and Kc(E). The proof first constructs the equivalent of the propagator K(q" q' t), called the parametrix, and then
studies the space of all curves connecting the starting point and the
endpoint; the stationary-phase method is used eventually. A physicist
can only express his awe in front of such a difficult, technical development.
In a similar vein, Chazarain (1974 and 1980) investigates the wave
equation ( a2 I at 2 - ~)u(q , t) = 0 on a Riemannian surface, and the
corresponding propagator, say K(q" q' t). The construction of K uses
Hormander's theory of Fourier integral operators, based on the notion
of bicharacteristics, which are none other than the classical trajectories
in phase space. Taking the trace of K, and using again the stationaryphase method allows the detailed study of the singularities of the trace
on the time axis.
The trace is singular with respect to t on a set of isolated points,
0 :s; t 1 :s; t2 :s; .... with only a finite number of consecutive = signs;
each time tj is the period of a periodic orbit. Between these singular
values of the time, the trace is infinitely differentiable. Near them, the
trace can be expanded in an exponential multiplying a power series.
Although it seems difficult to extract the details of this last statement
from the formal mathematical context, these results seem to be about
the best a physicist can ever hope for. Unfortunately, the author is not

298

The Trace Formula

aware of any special, but non-trivial examples worked out along these
lines.
Another mathematically rigorous approach is due to Albeverio,
Blanchard, and Hoegh-Krohn (1982) who deal directly with
Schrodinger's equation in the usual form, although some mild restrictions are imposed on the potential energy. These authors apply
their own method to treat the kind of oscillatory integrals that are the
characteristic feature of Feynman's path integral. Like Colin de
Verdiere and Chazarain, they work mostly with the so-called Thetafunction 8(t), the trace of the propagator K(q" q' t); cf. also Voros
(1987).

17.6 Extensions and Applications
The trace formula is easy to write down in the two extreme cases of
classical mechanics: the formula (16.16) of Berry and Tabor is valid
for integrable systems without degeneracies, and the formula (17 .13)
of the author is good for systems with hard chaos. In both cases, the
main idea is to start from Green's function or the propagator, and then
reduce their trace to a sum over all periodic orbits to get an approximate spectrum. When dealing with soft chaos, however, or various
special situations in the two extreme cases, the formulas (16.16) and
( 17.13) have to be modified, while holding on to the basic idea.
The derivation of (17.13) from (17.12) suggests that a similar formula holds for isolated elliptic orbits, provided Sinh(x/2) in the de. nominator is replaced by sin(x/2). The author (Gutzwiller 1971)
already noticed the trouble with this modification when x is a multiple
of 2'1T. He proposed to remedy the difficulty by interpreting the angle
x as part of the count of conjugate points; the denominator is eliminated, and the exponent in (17.13) gets a term -ix/2 which includes
the contribution -if'IT/2 from the conjugate points. The sum in
(17 .13) is then restricted to a primitive periodic orbit and all its multiples; the resulting geometric series has well-defined poles, where the
action

So(E) = (2n'IT + x/2)1i.

Voros (1975) and Miller (1975) had a better proposal. They expanded
2i sin(x/2)

= To ( e-ix/2 +e-3ix/2 +e-Six/2 + ... ) .( 17 _14 )

The first term is the same as in the author's argument; the additional
terms generate poles whenever S(E) = [2n'IT + (m + 1/2)x + f'IT/2]1i

17.6 Extensions and Applications

299

for m ~ 0. Very ingeniously, (m + 1/2)/i is interpreted as due to the
quantization of a harmonic oscillator whose elongation is transverse to
the periodic orbit. Without going into the details of his reasoning, it
may be enough to note that the surface of section around a stable periodic orbit does indeed look like that of a harmonic oscillator. The
main energy level En gets broadened into a vibrational band
En+ (m + 1/2)/iw with liw = x/To.
The same reasoning can be applied to systems with more than two
degrees of freedom, and results in more vibrational frequencies transverse to the periodic orbit. The neighborhood in phase space is assumed, in effect, to be isolated from the rest, as if it were a small
integrable domain. This view led Miller (1972) to quantize some simple many-body systems: e.g., in helium-like atoms, two electrons on
opposite sides of the nucleus in a 'symmetric stretch' define a periodic
orbit; similarly, three identical particles with the same pairwise potentials, oscillating around their equilibrium positions in an equilateral triangle. The quantization of these isolated periodic orbits yields good
energies when compared with exact quantum-mechanical calculations.
The issue of isolated stable periodic orbits was taken up again by
Richens (1982) who pointed out that Miller's approach was equivalent
to replacing the surface of constant energy in action space by its tangent plane. The formula of Berry and Tabor has to be refined in this
situation because the curvature in the denominator of (16.16) would
be 0, and yet the physical interpretation is not difficult.
The neighborhood of a periodic orbit was analyzed in Section 6.3
by expanding the action integral to second order in the displacements.
The classification in Section 6.4 and in (17 .13) ignores the complications which arise when the relevant quadratic forms have vanishing
eigenvalues. Ozorio de Almeida and Hannay (1987) push the required
expansions to higher order, and use the Birkhoff normalization
(Sections 8.4 and 14.3) to find the trajectories. Different types of
resonances must be distinguished, as the difference e between some
eigenvalues in the quadratic form (17 .8) becomes degenerate. Since
the trace formula is valid in the limit li-+0, the necessary modifications
depend on the way e and li go to zero relative to each other.
The same technique is used by Ozorio de Almeida (1986) to study
the modifications of the trace formula (16.16) for integrable systems,
when small perturbations of order e destroy the structure of invariant
tori in phase space. If e/li remains small, the trace formula remains
correct as if the system was still integrable; the density of states is insensitive to the intricacies of the classical orbit structure. If eI li is
large, however, the periodic orbits have to be treated as isolated, and
(17 .13) applies.

300

The Trace Formula

Although conservative systems with one degree of freedom are of
no interest for the study of chaotic behavior, another idea of Miller
(1979) is worth mentioning, because it can be generalized to two and
more degrees of freedom. The classical trace gc(E) is easy to get in
terms of the periodic orbits for a double-well potential, if we are willing
to accept imaginary action integrals, if dq [2m(V(q) - E)]ll 2 , whenever V(q) >E. The corresponding exponential is real, whereas so far
we had a purely imaginary dependence. The effect of variops potential
shapes on the splitting of nearly degenerate energy levels comes out
very clearly.
Another twist was given to the trace formula by Tabor ( 1983) when
he applied it to an area-preserving map in the spirit of Section 8.6.
Percival (1979) had shown how to define the required action integrals
so that all of the machinery in the preceding section can be used to
derive the formulas (17.12) and (17.13). Greene (1979) had developed a scheme for locating periodic orbits in the standard map (9.14),
as explained in Section 9. 8, with the help of the residues ( 17.12). The
stable periodic orbits lead rather quickly to well-defined peaks in the
density of states; it looks, however, as if many more of the unstable
ones have to be found before their contribution leads to any recognizable structure. Similarly, Wintgen (1988) has used relatively few periodic orbits to get the level density for the hydrogen atom: in a
magnetic field.
The scars of periodic orbits in the quantum eigenstates (cf. Section
15.6) have been analyzed recently with the help of the trace-formula
idea. Bogomolnyi (1988) goes as far as (17.8) in the derivation of the
trace formula, i.e., he identifies the two endpoints q' = q'' = q in
Green's function, and restricts himself to the neighborhood of a periodic orbit; but he does not carry out the integration over the transverse
coordinates q2 and q3 • Therefore, he gets the oscillatory part in the
square of the wave function because the quadratic terms (17.8) now
remain in the exponent. All kinds of valuable information about the
scars in terms of the monodromy matrix and the phase along the periodic orbit is obtained in this manner.
Berry (1989) uses a somewhat different strategy: the classical
Green's function (12.28) is used to calculate Wigner's distribution
i'(p, q) as the integral (15.13) where the density matrix p(q", q1 ) is
replaced by Gc(q11 , q1 ). The double integration again is carried out with
the help of stationary phases in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit,
although all expansions are now made in phase space rather than position space. The calculations get quite involved because the expansions
must be carried to third order in the displacements lJq and 8p. The trace
formula ( 17.13) and Bogomolnyi's density in position space are then

17.6 Extensions and Applications

301

obtained quite naturally by performing the required averaging in phase
space. The nature of scars can now be understood against the full
background of classical mechanics.

17.7 Sum Rules and Correlations
The trace formula (16.16) for an integrable system was shown in Section 16.6 to yield the correlations among the energy levels. The crucial
step was to form the sum of the absolute squares of the coefficients
A(E,M) in (16.16), and then reduce this sum to the density of states
po(E) within a factor 2'1T.
An analogous sum rule, for the coefficients in the trace formula
( 17.13) of a dynamical system with only isolated periodic orbits, was
found by Hannay and Ozorio de Almeida (1984) (cf. also Hannay
1985); Berry (1985) then derived the spectral rigidities from the trace
formula. These developments will be discussed in this section, without
attempting to present all the formal arguments. Finally, a number of
related papers will be mentioned that took off from the remarkable
results of these two papers.
It would take a lot of space to do justice to all of the fine points that
are hidden in the article of Hannay and Ozorio de Almeida. The main
line of the argument, however, can be seen in the following simplified
manner. In order to visualize the reasoning, the various 8-functions
will have a finite width e; r stands for the full complement of coordinates in the 2/-dimensional phase space; r1 designates a point which
arises from the initial point r 0 after the time t. The time average
< .. . >1 is defined as

(17.15)

where a short, but fixed interval of time near 0 is excluded from the
integration for technical reasons.
As long as Tis kept finite, the formula (17 .15) represents a tube of
width e which surrounds the trajectory toward the past and toward the
future. The integral of ( 17.15) over all phase space yields 1. In the two
extreme cases of mechanics, the following assumptions are made for
an arbitrary trajectory,

systems; I is the vector of conserved action integrals, and n is the normalizing volume for the numerator. The upper formula is the ergodic

302

hypothesis: the typical trajectory fills the whole energy surface. We
will continue only with this part of (17 .16); the lower part would lead
to the earlier sum rule, cf. Section 16.5.
At this point, we proceed somewhat differently from Hannay and
Ozorio. To make explicit use of (17 .16), let us choose a particular
surface of section ~ in the surface of constant energy. The f- 1 pairs
of canonically conjugate coordinates in~ are collectively called s; they
are complemented by the additional conjugate pair (E , t) as explained
in Section 7.5. A trajectory starting in So intersects~ consecutively in
the points s 1 , s 2 , ... at the future times t 1 , t2 , ... , and in the points
s_ 1 , s-2 , ... , at the past times L 1 , L 2•....
The measure on the surface of constant energy E is now expressed
in terms Of the function 8(s - S) = 8(s- S) T(S) on ~' where T(S) iS
half the time for the trajectory to get from the intersections' preceding
s , and on to the first intersection s" with ~ after s. Instead of the
function 8(r- r1) in (17.15) and (17.16), we now use the more explicit, but somewhat disorderly looking function a(s , t ; sa) =
L 8(! - ln) 8(s - Sn) .
If a(s , t ; s0 ) is integrated over s with some fixed s0 , one obtains a
function of t with sharp peaks every time the trajectory starting in so
at t = 0 intersects ~. The time average of this function, as defined in
( 17.15), yields 1 because every peak is weighted with the time interval
(tn+ 1 - ln-I)/2.

The ergodic hypothesis (17.16) for ergodic systems now becomes
(17.17)
<a(s,t;s0 )> 1 = T(s)/T"(~),

where T"(~) is the average time between intersections with~- In terms
of the volume w(~) of the surface of section, and Q(E) for the surface
of constant energy, one hasT"(~) = Q(E)/ w(~). In this formulation,
the different parts of ~ are weighted according as the times T to next
intersection. The surface of section ~ is used only to give a welldefined coordinate system on the energy surface; but the measure on
~ is chosen such as to yield the same measure as in (17 .16), independent of ~.
The statement ( 17.16) excludes a set of measure 0 that contains any
initial point r 0 belonging to a periodic orbit, and similarly, (17 .17) excludes such a set; but those are exactly the points we need. Therefore,
the ergodic hypothesis will be reformulated- strengthened would perhaps be a better term - using a(s , t ; sa) on~. The trick of Hannay and
Ozorio is to identify sand s0 , i.e., to consider a(sa , t ; s0 ) as a function
of s0 . If there is a periodic orbit with the period t at the given energy
E, and the point so is near it, this function differs from zero, and will

17.7 Sum Rules and Correlations

303

be larger the closer s0 happens to be. If s0 is allowed to roam around
in phase space, all the periodic orbits of period t will be picked up.
Since the periods of periodic orbits are a discrete set of increasing
numbers, T1 :5 T2 :5 ... , including repetitions, we can write

J

d 1 - 1pd 1 - 1qa(s,t;s) = ,LBj8(t-1j),

(17.18)

J

with the intensities Bj . They will turn out to be closely related to the
coefficients for the periodic orbit with number j in the trace formula
(17.13).
The ergodic hypothesis ( 17 .17) is now generalized: the time average
of a(s, t; s) as a function of sis the same as the time average (1 7.17),
which was given in (1 7.17) as distributed on the surface of section with the
relative weight r(s) . Another way of phrasing this idea is to say that
most of the very long periodic orbits are almost indistinguishable from
the ordinary trajectories.
The hidden difficulty with this idea comes from the great proliferation of periodic orbits in chaotic systems. As explained in Section
10.5, their number increases exponentially with their length according
as their topological entropy, cf. (10.10). The length was originally
defined as the value of the action integral S; the mean of the ratio
SIT can be obtained by integrating (p, q) over the energy surface; it is
f W(E)/Q(E) where W(E) is the volume of phase space below the energy E. Formula (17 .18) in conjunction with the g~meralized ergodic
hypothesis (17 .17), and the definition (17 .15) for the time average,
now becomes

L Bj = 2 T.

ITJI < T

T -+oc

(17.19)

In words, if we assign to each periodic orbit the appropriate fraction
of the energy surface, the sum of these fractions for the periods in the
interval from T to T + dT adds up simply to dT. The 'appropriate
fraction' for a particular periodic orbit decreases as its instability increases; indeed, we see from the definition of a that it is then difficult
to get s and so close to each other when t is large.
It remains to establish the connection between the intensities Bj and
the coefficients A j in ( 17.13) for the periodic orbit j, which correspond
to the A (E,M) in (16.16) for integrable systems.
Since the
8-functions have a small width e, the point so in the surface of section
can vary by some small displacements 8s0 . The corresponding change
in the argument of a(so, t ; so) is given by (I- 8sr/ 8so)8so, where I
stands for the 2(/- 1) by 2(/- 1) identity matrix, while the matrix
of partial derivatives is exactly the same as in (6.9). The integration

304

The Trace Formula

over 8so yields B1 = To1 I det(l - iJstf iJs0 ) = T01 IF( 1) where F( 1) is
defined in (6.11); it occurs again in p7.12), as well as in the trace
formula (17.13), so that B1 = li 2 IA1 1 IT01 , in terms of the primitive
period ToJ
Before inserting this relation into ( 17 .19), a few comments are required. The behavior of the sum for large Tis dominated by the long
periodic orbits; very few of these are repetitions of shorter ones, so the
distinction between primitive and ordinary period is not necessary.
Upon forming the sum over IA 1 121To1 for large periods, the denominator T01 can be replaced by its limiting value T and taken outside the
sum. For ergodic systems, therefore, the terms in the trace formula
(17 .14) grow as
(17.20)
(For integrable systems, the analogous sum increases only linearly with
T.) This sum rule is now used for an argument similar to the one given
in Section 16.6.
The main energy dependence in both trace formulas, (16.16) and
(17 .13), resides in the exponent, S(E) I li; the rate of change of this
exponent with E is Tlli since T = dSidE. The coefficient A1 in
(17.13) can be directly interpreted as the Fourier transform of x(t) in
(14.13), with the following replacements: t - E, w - Tlli, and
x(t) - p(E). According to (14.12), the asymptotic behavior of I(w)

C(t) = < x(O)x(t) >. In the present interpretation, the correlations
for small energy differences are such that the probability P(x) dx for
finding two adjacent levels at a distance between x and x + dx goes to
zero as x-0. For integrable systems, the analogous sum rule implies
that P(x) - 1 as x-0.
These results have been greatly strengthened by the work of Berry
(1985). His procedure is more direct; he inserts the trace formulas
(16.16) and (17.13) directly into the definition (16.5) for the rigidity
!::. 3 (LI p 0 , a), where the range of integration has been relabeled so that
L becomes the average number of states. If L is small compared with
the base ap 0 , the energy dependence in the various terms can be approximated by expanding around a; again, this dependence is important only in the exponents of (17 .13). The analytical formulas show
that !::. 3 depends only on the periodic orbits of period greater than
2p 0 1il L, and, therefore, on the sum rule (17.20). If Lis safely below
an upper limit Lrnax. to be specified shortly, the rigidities come out as
Ll15 for integrable systems, and as (16.10) for ergodic systems.

17.7 Sum Rules and Correlations

305

The limit Lrnax arises from the term in the trace formula with the
shortest period Tmin. presumably the first term in (16.16) or (17.13).
This period gives the fluctuation in the level density with the longest
correlation, and it is a very special feature of the particular dynamical
It makes itself felt over distances of the order of
system.
Lrnax ~ hpo/ Tmin in the energy spectrum. Since the Po increases as
h-f, the limit Lrnax increases as Planck's constant goes to 0, or equivalently, as the wavenumber k becomes large. When Lin the calculation
of the rigidity becomes large with respect to Lrnax. the relevant expression in terms of the coefficients Aj in the trace formula (16.16) is
a convergent sum. As a function of L the rigidity for an integrable
system is then seen to saturate, as was first noted in the numerical
computations of Casati et al. (1985); cf. Section 16.6.

17.8 Homogeneous Hamiltonians
Many of the most popular Hamiltonian systems have a special property
that simplifies some of the analytical and computational work: all their
trajectories can be organized into one-parameter families, where the
individual family members are transformed into one another by
changing the scales on all the coordinates appropriately. The
Anisotropic Kepler Problem (AKP) belongs here as shown at the beginning of Section 11.2; so does the free motion of a particle inside a
region with hard boundaries, or in a Riemannian space, and also problems where the potential energy is a homogeneous polynomial of the
position coordinates; but the Henon-Heiles model and the Toda lattice
are not of this type.
The trace formula (17 .13) now becomes very simple. The numerical input is rather small and gives us hope of understanding more intimately the relation between periodic orbits and energy levels. As in
(11.5), the action integral can be written as a product

~

Jpdq =

o<l»,

(17.21)

where <!» is a purely geometric quantity belonging to a particular periodic orbit (like 2'1T for the circle), and all the physics is combined in o.

The Trace Formula

where R is a characteristic length for the region where the particle
moves, such as the radius of curvature of a Riemannian space or the
diameter of a cavity. The parameters for the AKP are explained in
Section 11.1.
The energy E determines the scaling factor in all these cases; the
classical trajectories are computed at some arbitrary reference energy.
For a fixed value of li, however, the eigenvalues of Schrodinger's
equation are not subject to scaling. In quantum mechanics, the parameter a can be interpreted as the wave vector. It has very simple
values in certain easy cases: it is an integer for both the particle in a
one-dimensional box and for the electron in the hydrogen atom; but in
the last example, the simplicity is bought at the price of a very high
degeneracy for the energy level.
Not only the action (17.21) simplifies, but also the other ingredients
in the trace formula: both the stability exponent x and the number of
conjugate points f are independent of E, and the period is given by
T = a/21 £1 in both examples (17.22). If a particular periodic orbit
comes from repeating its primitive progenitor n times, we will write
x = na and f = n/3, and end up with
a

for the classical trace gc(E) where the outer summation goes over all
primitive periodic orbits (ppo).
If a has values, say, larger than 1, it is tempting to drop the term
exp( -na) from the denominator. Such a simplification would require
some corrections in Selberg's trace formula (cf. Chapter 19). The
term exp(- na) will definitely be dropped in Section 17 .10, when the
trace formula is applied to the AKP. Since the singularities in gc(E)
come from the long periodic orbits whose instability is invariably large,
there seems no great loss in simplifying (17.23) accordingly. If we do
so, the sum over n becomes a geometric series and can be carried out.
The next step in the reduction concerns the exact values of a and
{3. There are no conjugate points on a surface of negative curvature so
that /3=0. In the AKP, however, f3 =F 0; but its value depends in a very
simple manner on the periodic orbit, and is easy to incorporate into the
computations. On a surface of constant negative curvature 01. = cp;
in the AKP, the values of 01. vary quite a bit, although in the mean they
must increase linearly with cp, Indeed, if we write 01. ~ JLcp, the constant
of proportionality JL is the metric entropy of Section 10.3.
As a purely mathematical model of the trace formula, therefore, we
can assume a = JLcp and f3 = 0, so that

(17.24)

The only ingredients are the values of ~ for the primitive periodic orbits, and the entropy constant p.; the energy dependence is contained
in a through (17 .22). We can also study gc directly as a function of a
whose physical meaning is the wave vector conjugate to ~ and normalized to Planck's constant l'i.
The last expression for the classical trace can hardly be surpassed
in simplicity, and we can, therefore, hope to get some simple answers
concerning its validity, or usefulness in numerical computations. Can
we expect to find simple poles as a function of a, and are they located
on the real axis? Or even the preliminary question: does the sum over
the periodic orbits converge in the upper half-plane of a? There are
no good answers available at this time; this is not surprising since the
mathematicians have not succeeded even in the special case to be discussed in the next section.
Some of these questions can be reduced to a comparison between the
metric entropy p. and the topological entropy r (cf. Sections 10.3 and
10.5): the number of terms grows as exp(r~). whereas their absolute
value decreases as exp(- p.~/2). Absolute convergence requires that
Im(a) > r - p./2. Conditional convergence can be obtained, provided the complex phase exp(ia~) causes the right amount of destructive interference among terms with similar values of ~- If the phase
angles are distributed at random, we can indeed expect a further reduction in absolute value by the square root of the number of terms,
i.e., by a factor exp(- r~/2). If Pesin's theorem holds (cf. Section
10.5), i.e., r = p., we find the right-hand side of (17.24) convergent for
positive Im(a). The fluctuations of the action integral~ for different
periodic orbits enter as a crucial ingredient into the validity of the trace
formula, as was pointed out by the author (Gutzwiller 1986a); one is
tempted to speak of a third entropy, although nothing has been done as
yet to develop this idea.

17.9 The Riemann Zeta-Function
There exists a special mathematical model for the set of action integrals
~. which is almost too good to be true: ~ = logp where p runs
through the set of prime numbers. According to the Prime Number
Theorem (cf. Section 16.1), the number N(~ < ~) ~ e~/~ so that the
topological entropy equals r = 1. Therefore, we set p. = 1 in ( 17.24);

The first equality gives the usual definition, while the second represents
the infinite sum as an infinite product. The proof is almost trivial, although it took Euler to think of it; the second expression is referred to
as Euler's product for Riemann's zeta-function, a peculiar nomenclature since Euler lived a century before Riemann; formula (17 .25) results from differentiating the logarithm of Euler's product. Euler used
the divergence of the sum for Re(z) < 1 to show the existence of infinitely many primes.
The zeta-function is probably the most challenging and mysterious
object of modern mathematics, in spite of its utter simplicity. The
reader will find a concise introduction in Chapter XIII of Whittaker
and Watson's treatise (1927 and later), and a more exhaustive presentation in a book by Titchmarsh (1951); but the best source for the
mathematical novice is a monograph by Edwards (1974), which includes a lot of the historical background as well as the recent numerical
results.
The main interest comes from trying to improve the Prime Number
Theorem, i.e., getting better estimates for the distribution of the prime
numbers. The secret to the success is assumed to lie in proving a conjecture which Riemann stated in 1859 without much fanfare, and
whose proof has since then become the single most desirable achievement for a mathematician.
The zeta-function t(z) is well defined and analytic in the whole
complex plane with the exception of a simple pole at z = 1. It can
rather easily be shown to vanish when z is a negative, even integer,
t(- 2m) = 0 form integer and positive. Otherwise t(z) ¢ 0 outside the critical strip 0 < Re(z) < + 1. The Riemann Hypothesis states

17.9 The Riemann Zeta-Function

that all additional zeros are located on the critical line Re(z) = 1/2, the
median of the critical strip.

axis and an upper limity = Im(z) < Y can be estimated for large Y,

these 'non-trivial' zeros are at first rather sparse (aty1 = 14.135,.Y2 =
21.022, y 3 = 25.011, ... ), but eventually manage to have a density
p 0 (Y) = (1/2'1T) log(Y/2'1T) going to oo very slowly.
The numerical check of Riemann's hypothesis gets very difficult as
y increases, but the evidence for this conjecture is overwhelming since
it has now been established for y < 109 . Moreover, Odlyzko (1987)
has computed the first 105 zeros above 10 12 + 1 with an accuracy of
to- 8 . The latest work of Berry (1988) is based on this sample, but
his motivation for interpreting these data in the light of the general
trace formula (17 .13) dates further back.
Already Selberg had hoped to find a connection between his trace
formula (cf. Chapter 19) and the Riemann conjecture, but without
avail. A classical mechanical system with a well-behaved Hamiltonian
is needed, which also has a good quantum-mechanical relative, such
that, on the one hand, the lengths of the periodic orbits are given by the
logarithms of the prime numbers, and on the other hand, the energy
levels are the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. If we set a = E,
the comparison between (17.24) and (17.25) shows that our mathematical model for the trace formula has a simple pole with residue 1
at each one of the non-trivial zeros z = 1/2 + Yi withE= Yi.
The existence of a corresponding mechanical analog is not necessarily 'an impossible dream'. Most remarkably, the asymptotic distribution ( 17 .27) is realized for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in the
non-compact Euclidean domain that is bounded by the positive
Cartesian axis and the hyperbola xy = 1. Steiner and Trillenberg
(1990) have shown, however, that the further terms in (17 .27) do not
agree with the asymptotic distribution in the equivalent of Weyl's formula (16.3) for this particular domain. In any case, the closer study of
Riemann's zeta-function will help us to understand the trace formula.
A first analogy comes from the distribution of the zero spacings; it
conforms very closely with the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE),
which is similar to the GOE of Section 16.4; but its elements are the
Hermitian matrices, whose spectrum is invariant under (complex, linear) unitary transformations. The GUE is natural in chaotic systems
without time-reversal invariance; the analog of Wigner's surmise
(16.10) for the spacing of neighboring eigenvalues b{!Comes

for the GUE, and is again very close to the exact result. Berry ( 1986)
argues that such statistics for a set of numbers { Yi} are not easy to
justify, in contrast to a Poisson distribution, unless the eigenvalues of
a complex Hermitian matrix are involved.
A more compelling argument goes back to the analysis at the end
of Section 17.7. Instead of the rigidity, Berry (1988) computes the
number variance V(L, x), the mean square of the difference between
the actual and the average number of zeros in an interval of length L
near x; the distribution is normalized by studying the values
x1 = N(y1 ) with the help of (17 .27). Against all the rules of mathematical rigor, the poorly convergent series (17 .24) is inserted, and
V(L, x) is expressed as a sum over the periodic orbits, i.e., the prime
numbers.
The limit of very large prime numbers yields the number variance
to be expected from the GUE for moderate values of L. As L becomes
greater then 5, however, the short periodic orbits become dominant in
the formal expression for the number variance; V(L, x) deviates
strongly from the slowly increasing function of L for the GUE. Such
behavior was already noted at the end of Section 17.7.
The resulting highly unexpected behavior is plotted in Figure 50,
which shows the practically perfect fit with the data of Odlyzko. Most
remarkably, the mechanical interpretation has yielded a sharp mathematical result. At the same time a model has been found for investigating the level statistics in bona fide mechanical systems where the
available data are not in general as extensive as for the Riemann zetafunction.
The short periodic orbits obviously play a significant role which will
come out even more clearly in the next chapter. Formula (17 .24)
seems to suggest that singularities in gc(E) arise from the vanishing of
a denominator which is associated with a particular periodic orbit. The
author (Gutzwiller 1971) promptly succumbed to this temptation when
he tried to apply the newly found trace formula (17.13) to a system
with isolated unstable periodic orbits. He had computed only the simplest periodic orbit in the AKP so that (17.24) had only one term; the
quantization condition reduces to o<I> = 2m'TT with positive integer m.
Such a simple-minded interpretation of the trace formula has received
support from Ozorio de Almeida (1989) who studies the homoclinic
neighborhood of a periodic orbit. Nevertheless, great care is required
because the primitive periodic orbits proliferate exponentially.

semiclassical approximation (continuous line); the GUE result increases
monotonically as a logarithm, and fits only up to L = 3 [from Berry (1988)].
The mathematical background for this difficulty has been exposed
by Voros (1988). The denominators in (17.24) and (17.25) can be
directly reduced to the individual factors in Euler's product (17.26).
The Riemann zeta-function f(z) does not have poles at the zeros in the
Euler product because the latter does not converge at the presumed
location of these poles on the imaginary axis. It is the conspiracy of the
periodic orbits that leads to the singularities in the trace, but as Berry
(1985) and the author demonstrated, it takes relatively few primes in
(17.24) to bring out the zeros of f(z). The sparseness of the spectrum
greatly favors such a simple and mathematically dubious approach. For
the AKP and the free motion on a surface of constant negative curvature (cf. Section 19.6), an enormous number of periodic orbits are required to isolate the energy levels.
Before ending this section, the reader has to be warned that the term
'zeta-function' is commonly applied to a different function of the
spectrum,

312

(17.29)

where Ej is the j-th eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian H. The Riemann
zeta-function (17 .25) is associated with the harmonic oscillator as the
simplest conceivable example. Voros (1980) has studied the case of
the quartic oscillator in one dimension, and Steiner (1987a) has investigated various integrable billiards. Itzykson, Moussa, and Luck
(1986) have obtained sum rules for the zeta-function in the case of
two-dimensional flat billiards and used them to get lower bounds for
the low lying states. The relevance of ( 17 .29) for chaotic systems was
brought out in an article by Balazs, Schmit, and Voros (1987) which
will be discussed in Chapter 19.
The reader should also be aware of a whole class of 'zeta- functions'
which are related more directly to the trace formula. They were used
by Selberg (cf. Section 19.5) who recognized the formal similarity between (17.24) and (17.25); indeed, this similarity was his main inspiration for studying the flow of geodesics on a surface of constant
negative curvature, which is the main topic of Chapter 19. The analogy
was carried further by Smale ( 1967) for whom the zeta-function served
mainly as a means to enumerate the periodic orbits. Ruelle (1986) has
recently given a fairly general realization of this idea; it has become a
favorite mathematical object in the study of collisions (cf. end of Section 20.1, in particular Gaspard and Rice 1989). One of its basic
properties is inherent in the formulas (17 .37) and (17 .38): the classical
approximation for the energy levels is given by the zeros of a zetafunction that can also be defined as an infinite product over all periodic
orbits.

17.10 Discrete Symmetries and the Anisotropic Kepler Problem
Even a chaotic dynamical system may have discrete symmetries; e.g.,
the Hamiltonian ( 11.6) of the AKP remains the same if we change the
signs in both components of the conjugate pairs (u, x) or (v,y). (As
explained at the end of Section 11.2, the radial coordinate p is called y
when the angular momentum M = 0, in order to stress the planar nature of the trajectories.) Most trajectories, and in particular most periodic orbits, do not have any of the symmetries of their Hamitonian;
and yet, the spectrum is well known to split into sets of eigenstates
characterized by these discrete symmetries. How can the trace formula
accommodate this contrast between classical and quantal behavior?
The answer was given for the first time by the author (Gutzwiller 1980

17.10 Discrete Symmetries and the AKP

313

and 1982 with the details provided in the later paper); the same ideas
were formulated more generally by Robbins (1989)..
Rather than to set up general rules, we will discuss the AKP where
all the typical features of the problem are present. There are two reflection symmetries: the X-symmetry transforms a particular trajectory,
i.e., a solution of the equations of motion (11.7), into another trajecx+Xx = - x, and
tory by sending u+Xu = - u, v+Xv = v,
y+ Xy = y ; the Y-symmetry transforms a trajectory according as
u+Yu = u, v+Yv = - v, x+Yx = x, andy+Yy = - y.
In quantum mechanics, these two reflection symmetries allow us to
split the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian into four distinct, and mutually
orthogonal sets, each characterized by the obvious names:
X-even: <J>(Xq) = <J>(q) ,
X-odd: <t>(Xq) = - cp(q) ,
(17.30)
Y-even: <J>(Yq) = <J>(q),
Y-odd: cp(Yq) = - cp(q).
We will discuss the effect of the X-symmetry on the trace formula in
some detail, and only quote the results for theY-symmetry.
Let us give the names <P to the X-even states, and '1/1 to the X-odd
ones; the expansion (13.10) for Green's function then becomes,

The X-even and the X-odd parts can be separated from each other so
as to have a Green's function Ge for the X-even eigenstates, and Go for
the X-odd ones:
Ge(q" q' E) = [G(q" q' E) + G(Xq" q' E)]/2,
Go(q'' q' E) = [G(q" q' E) - G(Xq" q' E)]/2.
0 7 ·32)
The definitions ( 17.4) for the trace g(E) and (17 .6) for the density of
states p(E) are now applied to the X-even and the X-odd Green's
functions to yield the corresponding traces and densities of states; they
are distinguished by carrying the appropriate indices.
The derivation of the trace formula in Section 17.4 has to be repeated for Ge and for G0 • The new feature is the second term on the
right-hand side of (17.32); if q" = q' = q, then we have to deal with
an excitation of the system in q and its response in Xq, rather than with
the response in the same place q as the excitation. When G on the
right-hand side of (17 .32) is replaced by Gc, we have to consider trajectories that start in q and end in Xq ; they are not closed any longer.
As the starting point q ranges over the whole position space that is
classically accessible at the stipulated energy E, the endpoint Xq runs

314

The Trace Formula

over the mirror images with respect to they-axis, while the trajectory
connecting them deforms smoothly.
In the spirit of the stationary-phase method, we ask as in ( 17. 7) for
the rate of change of the exponent S(Xq q E) I li with respect to q ; it
now becomes Xp" - p' . Constructive interference in the integral over
q requires that the trajectory from q to Xq end up with a momentum
that is X-symmetric with respect to the starting momentum. Such a
trajectory will be called an X-periodic orbit; it actually closes smoothly
like an ordinary periodic orbit, if it is continued to twice its running
time.
The trace formulas for ge(E) and for g0 (E) look just like (17.13);
but apart from an overall factor 1/2, the sum over periodic orbits is
now extended to include the X-periodic orbits. Notice that these new
orbits are affected with different signs, + for X-even trace gec(E) and
- for X-odd trace g0 c(E).
The same reasoning applies to the mirror symmetry with respect to
the x-axis, called the Y -symmetry. At this point, however, the basic
three-dimensional nature of the problem makes itself felt. With the
angular momentum around the x-axis M = 0, the eigenstates can depend only on the absolute value of the radial distance which is y in our
nomenclature. Therefore, we will consider only the Y-even states, and
their Green's function.
The traces ge and go will from now on be understood as belonging
to the even Y-symmetry. Nevertheless, the trace formula (17 .13) gets
further amplified by the inclusion of the Y -periodic as well as the
XY-periodic orbits; but the signs are determined by the X-symmetry.
Notice that the collection of periodic orbits gets larger as the set of
corresponding eigenstates becomes smaller because of their symmetry.

17.11 From Periodic Orbits to Code Words
The most remarkable feature about the AKP was the possibility to code
all the trajectories with infinite binary sequences, in a one-to-one and
continuous manner (cf. Section 11.3); all the periodic orbits can be
enumerated by the binary sequences of even length (cf. Section 11.5).
Before trying to calculate the trace formula (17 .13), this scheme has
to be enlarged so as to include the three new kinds of periodic orbits.
An X-periodic orbit ends up on the same side of the x-axis, whose
intersections define the binary code; there is an even number 2k of
intersections between q and Xq, say the sequence (a1. ... , a 2k). When
the trajectory is continued, it will close itself smoothly after 2k more

17.11 From Periodic Orbits to Code Words

315

intersections with the x-axis; but the intersections take place at the
X-symmetric locations on the x-axis, so that corresponding binaries are
(Qj, ... , a2k) where iii= -a;. As one keeps on running around the Xperiodic orbit and its extension, the binary sequence consists of alternating segments with opposite signs.
This feature is important when the length of the X-periodic orbit is
approximated by the formula (11.15), which uses the binaries directly.
The second summation in (11.15), for j from - oo to +oo was defined
by stipulating that a1 + 2k = a1, but this condition for extending the
summation now gets changed into a1 + 2k = -a1. This change in sign
will allow us in the next section to see how the quantum-mechanical
spectrum actually divides into completely separate sets.
TheY-periodic orbits have to be treated in the same manner. Their
endpoint has the opposite y-coordinate from the starting point; therefore, an odd number 2k + 1 of intersections occurs in between; let the
corresponding binary sequence be (a 1, ••• , a2k + 1). As the Y-periodic
orbit is continued until it closes smoothly, the same sequence of intersections with the x-axis takes place. This sequence of length 2k + 1
repeats itself indefinitely; the formula (11.15) stays again the same,
except that the first summation, over i, goes from 1 to 2k + 1, and the
second summation requires that a1 + 2k + 1 = ai.
The trace formula was originally derived in order to find an approximate spectrum for a classically chaotic system on the basis of the
classical trajectories. Einstein (1917) was the first to recognize that a
real problem lay ahead when the classical system was no longer
integrable. If the summation over all the periodic orbits can be carried
out, the singularities in the £-dependence can be identified as energy
levels. The results of Berry (1985) as reported in Section 17.7 apply
only to the correlations in the spectrum, but not to the calculation of
individual energies. This challenge will be taken up in this section,
based upon the author's work (Gutzwiller 1980 and 1982) on the AKP.
The starting point is the expression ( 17.23) where we have to insert
the approximation (11.15) for the normalized action integral in terms
of the binary sequences that characterize the periodic orbits, including
the modifications of the preceding section due to the discrete symmetries. The trace formula now becomes a sum over binary sequences;
two comments of a general nature are called for.
The binary sequences constitute a code. Such a code describes the
dynamical system almost as well as the original equations of motion,
provided it is supplemented with a formula like (11.15) for the action
integral. Hard chaos, in contrast to soft chaos, is expected to offer a
good code for its systems; the problem is no longer how to solve the
equations of motion with general initial conditions, and for arbitrarily

316

The Trace Formula

long times, but to find the appropriate code. The AKP must be an exceptionally simple case in this respect, but general procedures to establish appropriate codes have been in use for some time to describe
the geodesics on a surface of negative curvature. Some special cases
will be discussed in Chapter 20.
The general requirements for the use of a code in connection with
the trace formula can be gathered from the way it works out in the
AKP. The connection with classical statistical mechanics is hard to
avoid. A binary sequence, in conjunction with a formula like (11.15),
is the most elementary model of a spin system. The imaginary factor
io is replaced by the real negative quantity -1 I k B T, with the
Boltzmann constant kB and the absolute temperature T. Notice that
the signs are correct: if the energy E in the formulas (17.22) is replaced
byE+ ie with a positive e, we go smoothly into statistical mechanics.
The method of transfer matrices in the next section is taken from there,
although much more is demanded of it in our context than in its field
of origin.
Before applying this method to the trace formula (17 .23), the stability exponent a and the phase loss {3 in the primitive orbit have to be
determined. The rule on {3 is simple: each crossing of the x-axis, or
equivalently each binary, leads to a loss of 'IT. The corresponding two
conjugate points are found, the first somewhere between two consecutive crossings, and the second at the crossing itself. The latter arises
only in three dimensions where the whole plane of the trajectory is rotated around the x-axis. The restriction to Y-even orbits and the extra
conjugate point are the main differences between two and three dimensions, exactly as in the ordinary Kepler problem.
The stability exponent a cannot be handled so convincingly. The
numerical data from all the periodic orbits up to 10 binaries (cf.
Gutzwiller 1981) show that they cannot be approximated by as simple
a formula as (11.15) for the action «1>. If the mean for each length of
orbit (in terms of binaries) is taken, a fairly good proportionality with
the number of binaries is seen. Without thinking of the entropy, the
author originally settled for the value a = .75, and noticed only many
years later that this value is tantalizingly close to log(2). The discrepancy, if it is real, could probably be found in the wide scatter of the
«1>-values for a given binary length; it is such as to cover the average of
the actions for both shorter and longer orbits. For the numerical calculations, a= 2ka0 was assumed, with a0 = .75, for an orbit of 2k
binary length.
If the binaries are used as independent parameters for the sum over
the periodic orbits, each orbit is overcounted by the number of binaries
defining the period. This difficulty is actually more subtle, because if

17.11 From Periodic Orbits to Code Words

317

the periodic orbit is the repetition of a shorter one, the overcounting
factor is only as large as the length of the primitive periodic orbit;
moreover, some orbits have symmetries with respect to the two
coordinate-axes and/ or time-reversal. These are reflected in their binary representation and lead again to lesser overcounting. All these
features, however, tie in perfectly with the primitive period To which
multiplies each term in the trace formula. Everything is accounted for
if To is replaced by TIN, where T is the ordinary period, and N is the
number of binaries.
A further step in the reduction of ( 17.23) uses T = dS I dE, and the
fact that neither a nor {3 depend on E. Both sides can be integrated
with respect to E, leaving the lower limit open. Thus, we arrive at
E

gc(E) dE= exp(io4>) , (17.33)

where the inner sum goes over the binary sequences of length N . The
Y-periodic orbits are already included in the terms with odd N. Their
phase loss of '1T yields the factor ( -1 )N. The uniform binary sequences
( + + + ... ) or (--- ... ) are included in the addition, although they have
no correspondent among the periodic orbits in the AKP, but their
contribution can be calculated in closed form, and subtracted. Similarly, we keep the term N = 1, although there are no such Y-periodic
orbits. The separation into an X-even and an X-odd part according as
(17.32) has not been carried out as yet at this point.

17.12 Transfer Matrices
In order to explain the idea of the transfer matrix, the expression
(11.15) is simplified for the time being. Instead of two binaries a; and
aj contributing according as exp( - y li- ;!), however far apart, the
range of interaction is limited to the f nearest neighbors; therefore,

it is always assumed that a;_ N = a;. The coefficients A, B, ... , L are
positive and decreasing. The peculiar combinations ( 1 - a,a; _ 1 ) have
been chosen to make sure that 4>=0 when a 1 = a2 = ... =aN.
A 2' by 2' matrix Te is now defined, where the rows are labeled by
the binary sequences (a;, a;_ 1, ... , a;_ e + 1), and the columns by the
the matrix element is
binary sequences (a;_ 1, a;_ 2 , ... , a;_ e);
exp(ioci>) as given by (17 .34). As an example,

where a = exp(2ioA) and b = exp(2iaB).
The inner sum of ( 17.3 3), over the binary sequences of length N, can
now be expressed as the matrix multiplication of (T e)N; the reader will
need a little patience to see this fact clearly. Te effects the transfer
from the subsequence (ai _ 1, ai _ 2, ... , ai _e) to the subsequence
( ai, ai _ 1, ... , a; _ e + 1), hence the name transfer matrix.
The invariance of ~ with respect to the transformation aj - - aj
for j = 1, ... , N allows us to split T 2 into two square blocks of equal
size along the diagonal, by a similarity transformation S 2,

If f =1, each block has only one row and one column; the upper block

is 1 +a, and the lower block 1 -a. For f > 2, these blocks have a
simple structure, provided ~ is given by the expression (17 .34); cf.
Gutzwiller (1988a).
Notice that this method could equally well take care of an expression for~ that includes terms such as Ma;a; _ 1a; _ 2a; _ 3 , in addition to the ones in (17. 3 4). The splitting into two diagonal blocks is
still feasible, as long as there are only terms of even order in the binaries; that requirement goes directly back to the time-reversal invariance
of the AKP.
When taking the trace of (Te)N, the chain of binaries gets wrapped
around according as ai _ N = ai , corresponding to the ordinary periodic orbits. The closure condition ai _ N = - ai for the X-periodic
orbits is obtained, if all the binaries are inverted before taking the trace.
This inversion J is accomplished by inserting an 2e by 2e matrix which
has 1's in the diagonal from the upper right to the lower left, and O's
elsewhere. After the similarity transformation (17 .36), the inversion
J takes the 2-block diagonal form, with + 1 in the diagonal of the upper
block, and -1 in the diagonal of the lower block, with O's elsewhere.
Again, the reader has to check these elementary facts.
At last, the X-even and the X-odd traces can be worked out by
combining (17.32) with (17.33), and summing over the binary sequences of length N by taking the trace of (T e)N. Since the trace of a
matrix does not change under similarity transformations, the blockdiagonal form (17 .36) of T e is applied. The X-even trace gee( E) uses

17.12 Transfer Matrices

319

only the upper block, while the X-odd trace g0 c(E) depends only on the
lower block.
If f = 1, the upper trace reduces to ( 1 + a )N and the lower trace to
(1 - a)N. Iff> 1, however, each block has to be diagonalized. The
diagonal elements of Teare the eigenvalues Am(o) with m = 1, 2, ... ,
2 e - 1; their dependence on the physical parameter o is kept explicitly
in view. For f = 2, the two eigenvalues in each block can be obtained
from solving a simple quadratic equation in accordance with (17 .36),
but one can hardly avoid numerical calculations for f > 2. The dependence of the eigenvalues Am( o) on the parameters A, B, ... , L is not
easy to visualize.
The trace of the transfer matrix in terms of the eigenvalues A is now
inserted into (17.33),
N

which is valid both for the X-even and the X-odd spectrum, provided
the appropriate eigenvalues A are used. Miraculously, the sum over N
is the expansion of log(l + x). If both sides are exponentiated, and
we recall the original expansion ( 17.4) for the quantum-mechanical
trace g(E), we get the final formula,

The ~ sign refers mainly to the classical approximation that justifies
the right-hand side, but also to a number of minor details such as a
constant factor, which were neglected in the derivation.
The classical approximation to the spectrum is now obtained by
finding the values of o where one of the factors on the right vanishes.
The explicit computation of these zeros is based on inserting
A(o) = - exp(a0 /2) into the characteristic polynomial of the transfer
matrix, so that
(17.39)
det ITe(o) + exp(a 0 /2) I = 0.
If f = 1, this condition becomes trivial, because T1 is already diagonal after the similarity transform (17.36). The solution is multiplevalued because o occurs in the exponents of the matrix elements
a, b, .... Thus,
X-even: 2oA = (2n + 1)'1T- i log(1 + exp(a 0 /2)),

(17 .23) over the periodic orbits, cf. Gutzwiller (1980 and 1982).

the energy levels is obtained, with alternating X-even and X-odd
states; the lowest state is X-even.
This lengthy development was explained to the reader because it
gives a systematic method for finding approximate energy levels from
the trace formula (17.13), assuming that the periodic orbits have been
coded. In exactly this way, the author (Gutzwiller 1980 and 1982) was
able to get a spectrum for the AKP, the first time such a calculation for
a chaotic system had ever been completed on the basis of the classical
periodic orbits.
The relation between the binary code and the action integral is given
by ( 11.15) in the AKP. The coefficients decrease exponentially and
do not have a finite range f as in (17 .34 ). The transfer matrix is infinite; but its simple structure allows an approximate treatment (cf. the
1982 paper), and leads to rather good results as shown in Table I which
gives the comparison with the recent extensive calculations of Wintgen,
Marxer and Briggs (1987).
Nevertheless, ( 17.40) shows that we have to expect to find complex
quantum numbers a, if the right-hand side of the trace formula ( 17.14)

17.12 Transfer Matrices

321

is evaluated. In other words, the density of states Pc(E) does not consist of 8-functions, but rather of some broadened peaks. In the case
of (17.40), the imaginary part, log(l + exp(ao/2)) = .88 for ao =log
2, has to be compared with the separation 2'1T between the levels of the
same symmetry; the result is satisfactory. There is no general argument
available at this time, however, to suggest that the trace formula always
performs at least that well. Our confidence still rests mainly on the
Selberg trace formula which gives perfect results as will be explained
in Chapter 19.
The locations of the singularities in the complex plane were calculated by the author (Gutzwiller 1988a) for a finite range of the interactions A , ... , L, rather than for the infinite range that leads to Table
I. Even for f up to 4, the zeros keep drifting away from the real £-axis.
This phenomenon may be related to the correlations found by Pandey,
Bohigas, and Giannoni (1989) when the number m +an+ {3k are
mapped onto the unit-circle; m, n, k are integers (cf. Section 10.2).
Cvitanovic (1988) together with Eckhardt (1989) has proposed a
different method for numerically summing the right-hand side of the
trace formula (17.13). They generate all the periodic orbits in terms
of a few elementary 'cycles'; those are the simplest periodic orbits. If
appropriately chosen, all the terms in (17 .13) can be very nearly compensated with the right combination of cycles, at least when the reciprocal of the zeta-function is calculated; this object is the exponential
of the left-hand side in (17 .33) or (17 .4) and becomes the product
TI(E- Ej), exactly what was calculated in (17.38).
This new scheme has been worked out for the scattering from the
circular disks in the open Euclidean plane, and gives excellent results
for the poles in the scattering amplitudes; it has not been tried as yet
for bound states as in the AKP. The trajectories or periodic orbits are
essentially reduced in a symbolic manner to the combination of the
simplest of their kind; this construction of the symbolic sequences appears somewhat different from the binary sequences for the AKP in
Chapter 11, or similar ones to be discussed in Chapter 20. It may
possibly yield a more direct access to the singularities of Green's
function than the transfer matrices of this section, or it may ultimately
turn out to be quite similar.

CHAPTER 18

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

The effect of a magnetic field on an atom has been studied for a long
time and has played a crucial role in the understanding of atomic
physics. The magnetic fields available in the laboratory are small,
however; their action in the atom used to be well explained by perturbation theory. The evidence for strong magnetic fields was first
found by the astronomers in white dwarfs some twenty years ago, and
extremely strong fields are assumed to exist in neutron stars. This discovery led to laboratory experiments that somehow manage to imitate
the extraordinary conditions in these exceptional stars.
The main idea is to prepare the atom in a very highly excited, but
still bound state, so that the orbit of the electron encloses a large area,
and thus a large magnetic flux even in a relatively small field. Perturbation theory is then no longer applicable; the dominant term in the
Hamiltonian is no longer the linear one (in the field strength) which
leads to the ordinary Zeeman effect.
By contrast, the quadratic term in the Hamiltonian is ordinarily not
as interesting, because it comes into play only when the atom or molecule does not have a magnetic moment to start with, and it leads to a
small negative magnetic susceptibility, called diamagnetic rather than
the much larger positive paramagnetic one. The quadratic, or
diamagnetic term, however, eventually leads to chaotic classical motion, whereas the linear, or paramagnetic term can be effectively eliminated by using a rotating frame of reference as in Hill's theory of the
Moon (cf. Chapter 5).

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

323

Experiments on atoms near the ionization threshold have become
possible in the last decade because of the great strides in optical technology, as well as in the preparation of atomic beams and vapors.
Whereas the pioneering work was done on alkali metals and alkaline
earths, the last few years have produced detailed spectra for hydrogen
atoms. They seemed at first utterly confusing, but they now appear
understandab le in terms of classical periodic orbits, isolated and unstable like the ones in the preceding chapter. The underlying classical
behavior is probably a case of soft chaos since the system is integrable
in both limits, very weak and very strong magnetic fields.
This chapter does not try to discuss all the recent work in this active
area nor is it possible to offer a definitive picture since not all the evidence is in as yet. We will, therefore, concentrate on the aspects most
directly related to our main concern, the symptoms of chaos in quantum mechanics and their explanation in terms of classical orbits.
Atomic physics in high magnetic fields has been surveyed by Gay
(1984 and 1985); extensive reviews on the Diamagnetic Kepler Problem have recently been written by Hasegawa, Robnik, and Wunner
(1989) as well as by Friedrich and Wintgen (1989).

18.1 The Hamiltonian in the Magnetic Field
The magnetic force on an electric chargee has its origin in the theory
of relativity. It arises only when the charge is moving, and its strength
is proportional to the ratio of its velocity to the velocity of light. The
equations of motion in the combined electric field F and magnetic field
B are given by

(18.1)

where the symbol 1\ indicates the vector product. The second term on
the right is called the Lorentz force, in honor of H.A. Lorentz who was
one of the first to reduce atomic physics to the interplay of electric
charges around 1900. Both the electric and the magnetic fields are
assumed to be known functions of the position q = (qi, q2 , q3 ) =
(xi, x2, x3) = (x,y, z) and the timet.
Maxwell's equations, which govern all of electrodynamics, allow us
to introduce the four-component vector potential (Ao, AI, A2, A 3 ), which
determines the electric and magnetic fields through the relations

where the indices i,j, k are a cyclic permutation of (1, 2, 3). The
0-component Ao is the ordinary electrostatic potential, usually called
V = e Ao. The vector potential is not uniquely determined by the
fields F and B, however, because the fields on the left in (18.2) remain
the same if we replace A by A', where

i.e., the equations (2.2) yield (18.1), if applied to (18.4). This
Hamiltonian can be obtained from the expression (7 .11), if we set
M = m 2c 2 , and solve for p 0 ; if the resulting square root is expanded in
powers of the three spatial components of the momentum, the lowest
term is indeed (18 .4). The intrinsic angular momentum of the electron,
the electron spin, is completely left out of the discussion in this chapter.
Most remarkably, the Hamiltonian involves the vector potential,
while the equations of motion contain only the fields. The Hamiltonian
is sensitive to the transformation (18.3), but the equations of motion
(18.1) are not; this property is called gauge invariance, because the
vector potential, in particular the electrostatic potential Ao = V/e,
defines a gauge (voltage) for any measurements.
Since Schrodinger's equation is taken directly from the
Hamiltonian, it is sensitive to the choice of the gauge as well. A change
of the gauge (18.3) has to be compensated by a change in the phase
of the wave function 1/;(x, y, z, t) -+ t/.; 1(x, y, z, t), where

where Lz = x Py - y Px is the angular momentum in the z-direction; the
right-hand side contains the kinetic energy, the Coulomb potential, the
(paramagnetic) Zeeman energy, and the (diamagnetic) quadratic term.
We will now switch over to quantum mechanics without much ado, and
assume that the reader is familiar with elementary atomic physics.

18.2 Weak Magnetic Fields and the Third Integral
Until recently, the last term in (18.6) was always assumed to be much
smaller than the third in the usual applications, unless the angular momentum Lz happened to vanish. To a first approximation, the last term
was neglected. Since Lz commutes with the Hamiltonian, every level
in the hydrogen atom is split by the Zeeman energy eliB /2mc according
as the z-component of the angular momentum. That leaves a large degeneracy, because for each principal quantum number n, there are n
different values of the total angular momentum f ; a particular
eigenvalue f z of Lz can belong to different values of f . The further
splitting according as f is due to the diamagnetic term, but its calculation by perturbation theory is not easy and cannot be pushed very far.
A deeper understanding of the Kepler problem involves the RungeLenz vector
(18.7)
Since the scalar product (L, A) = 0, the Runge-Lenz vector lies in the
plane of the Kepler orbit. It points toward the perinucleus (point of
closest approach to the nucleus), and its length, A2 = 2mEL 2 + m2e4,
differs by a factor m 2e4 from the square of the eccentricity.
In quantum mechanics, the operators associated with L and A generate a group that is isomorphic with the rotations in a fourdimensional space, rather than only the three-dimensional rotations
from L alone. A commutes with the Kepler Hamiltonian just as L does;
the spectrum of the Kepler problem can be treated, therefore, exactly
as the spectrum of a particle on a four-dimensional sphere. Pauli
(1926a) was the first to exploit this fact to obtain the levels in the hydrogen atom by purely algebraic manipulations. Fock (1935) then
made the connection explicit by going into momentum space; the discussion in Section 12.4 and 12.8 is based on this idea.
How much of this high degeneracy survives in a magnetic field? The
first indications came from calculations by Zimmerman, Kash, and
Kleppner (1980) who obtained the energies as a function of the field
strength for even parity, 4 = 0 states with principal quantum numbers
n from 1 to 22. When plotted against B 2 , the individual levels run along

326

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

roughly straight lines that converge to their points of degeneracy at
B = 0. Since there is no symmetry left in the problem, these lines are
not expected to cross, or even get very close. They should repel and
avoid one another like the two branches of a hyperbola. Such is indeed
the case for n < 8. For 10 :::; n :::; 16, however, the 'anti-crossings'
become ever tighter as n increases, and they do so with an exponential
dependence on n.
Robnik ( 1981) found evidence in the classical surfaces of section
that the diamagnetic Kepler problem is less chaotic than our inability
to solve the equations of motion seemed to suggest. Reinhardt and
Farrelly (1982) used the Birkhoff-Gustavson normalization (cf.
Sections 8.4 and 14.3) to match the results of Zimmerman et al..
Delos, Knudson, and Noid (1983) obtained the energy as a function
of three actions I by perturbation theory, and then calculated the
spectrum as in an integrable system, again with good results beyond
expectations.
The explanation involves a 'third integral' like the one invoked by
the astronomers to explain the motion of stars in the galactic
gravitational potential (cf. Section 8.1). The first concrete proposal
came from Solovev (1981 and 1982), and Herrick (1982) who had
discovered an approximate third integral for the He-atom (Herrick and
Sinanoglu 1975). Hasegawa with Harada and Lakshmanan (1983,
1984, and later) as well as Delande and Gay (1984) worked out many
more of the geometric details; Deprit together with Coffey, Ferrer,
Miller, and Williams (1986 and 1988) applied the perspective of celestial mechanics and the mathematics of dynamical systems.
A linear combination of A;+ A} and AJ, whose coefficients are
independent of the field B, is the best thing one can hope for as a third
integral. When the time derivatives of these two quantities are calculated, the terms proportional to B 2 can be canceled out in
2
2
2
(18.8)
K = 4 (Ax + Ay) - Az ,
provided the time derivative of K is averaged over a periodic orbit. The
explicit construction of such an approximate constant of motion, and
the particular criterion for justifying it, seems to be new in classical
mechanics. There may be other problems where this method leads to
a better understanding of an almost integrable system.

18.3 Strong Fields and Landau Levels
The terms in the Hamiltonian (18.6) are ordered in decreasing strength
for the case of a weak magnetic field; the diamagnetic term was treated

18.3 Strong Fields and Landau Levels

327

as a perturbation to the Coulomb potential. In very strong magnetic
fields, the ordering is opposite; the Coulomb attraction to the nucleus
becomes a small disturbance. This situation was first studied by Yafet,
Keyes, and Adams (1956). It arises near the impurity in a semiconductor, both because the effective mass of the electron is small, and
because the dielectric constant of the crystal is large (cf. Section 11.1),
which does not affect the two magnetic terms in (18.6), however. The
whole question was reviewed by Hasegawa (1969).
The lowest order approximation ignores the Coulomb potential; the
electrons are free except for the presence of the magnetic field, a situation encountered in metals, and that was first investigated by Landau.
Classically, the electron moves along a helix whose axis is parallel to
the magnetic field. The motion is uniform in the z- direction, whereas
it is a uniform rotation in the xy-directions, on a circular track of radius
2mE - p} I mwc. The rotational speed is the cyclotron frequency
we = eB/mc. Notice that the time for the electron to go around its
circular track is independent of its kinetic energy E - p} /2m in the
xy-plane; that is the basic idea behind the original cyclotron accelerators.
The quantum description is more complicated and somewhat confusing because various gauges for the magnetic field can be used.
Contrary to the treatment in the books' on solid-state physics, we will
stay with the symmetric gauge; the location of the atom and its
Coulomb potential will be the origin for the coordinate system. The
wave function becomes a product of a plane wave exp(ikz) in the direction of the magnetic field, and a two-dimensional harmonic
oscillator function in the xy-plane. The paramagnetic term in (18.6)
makes us organize the oscillator states according as their angular momentum, but the energy of the electron,
E = (N + 1/2) liwc + li 2k 2 /2m,
(18.9)

V

does not depend on the value Mli of Lz. For fixed k, the spectrum looks
like a harmonic oscillator with steps liwc, although each level is highly
degenerate; these are the Landau levels.
Garton and Tomkins (1969) were the first to see a Landau-like
spectrum near the ionization limit of Ba in a field of 2.4 Tesla. Very
surprisingly, however, the spacing was in steps of about 1.5 liwc, aresult that was consistently confirmed in later measurements on other
hydrogen-like atoms in very high magnetic fields. An explanation was
given by Edmonds (1970) using the Bohr-Sommerfeld (or EBK)
quantization condition ( 14.4) for the motion at right angles to the
z-axis. Although such an argument seems quite arbitrary, it does give

328

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

an answer in accord with the experiments, and has to be considered
seriously.
The momentum Pz is set to 0 for this calculation; polar coordinates
are used in the xy-plane, with the radial distance p and the conjugate
momentum pP' The quantization condition is f pP dp = (A + 1/2)'1Tii,

the integration is between the limits PI and P2 where Pp = 0, all at a
fixed value of z. If z is very large, the Coulomb potential becomes small
for all p so that we are left with the pure magnetic field, and the Landau
spectrum is obtained. As z decreases, however, the energy differences
increase, while remaining roughly constant as a function of E. When
z = 0, the steps are 1.58 liwc around E = 0, as in the experiment.
Fonck, Tracy, Wright, and Tomkins (1980) went up to 4 Tesla in
both barium and strontium and got almost perfect agreement with the
formula (18.10) for the spectrum near the ionization threshold. More
comprehensive data of the same kind are reported by Gay and
coworkers (1980). The individual lines in the quasi-Landau spectrum
have a very complicated shape with many subsidiary peaks that still
have to be explained; on this finer scale the spectrum looks quite chaotic.
A remarkable interpretation of these details was given by Castro,
Zimmerman, Hulet, Kleppner, and Freeman (1980). The spectra for
sodium in magnetic fields from 1 to 5.5 Teslas, in roughly even steps
for B 2 , show that after a very complicated intermediate region, the
oscillator strengths tend to group themselves preferentially around the
lines of the quasi-Landau spectrum. Some of the details can be seen
in the results of a straightforward diagonalization of (18.6) in a basis
of zero-field eigenfunctions for the Coulomb potential.
More sophisticated calculations were carried out by Clark and
Taylor (1980 and 1982) in a Sturmian basis, i.e., using again the
eigenfunctions of the Kepler problem, but with the scale in the
Laguerre functions independent of the principal quantum number.
This basis is complete without requiring the positive-energy
eigenfunctions and still preserves some of the advantages of the hydrogen eigenfunctions. Delande and Gay (1986) provide the arguments for the best choice of the Sturmian functions on the basis of the
underlying group theory.
The resulting spectra are quite complicated. They arise from the
mixing of states that were either degenerate or well separated in a zero

magnetic field. Thus, there are two regimes as the field increases: in
the f -mixing, states with different values of the total angular momentum fli, but belonging to the same principal quantum number n, get
scrambled; in the n-mixing regime, states from different levels in the
field-free atom get mixed. Of course, the spectrum observed in the
laboratory consists of transitions between these energy levels; in the
absence of selection rules, only a plot of the computed oscillator
strengths gives a realistic picture of the difficulties in the physical interpretation. Figure 51 shows such a plot; the impression of chaos is
hard to avoid.

18.4 Scaling the Energy and the Magnetic Field
The structure of the classical trajectories in phase space has to be freed
of all incidental features, in order to establish a connection between the
classical and the quanta! regime. Three physical parameters occur in
(18.6): the mass m, the squared charge e 2 , and the magnetic field Bin
the combination of the cyclotron frequency we = eB/mc. As in any
good non-linear classical system, like the Toda lattice (cf. Section 3.6)
or the Henon-Heiles model (cf. Chapter 8), all dynamical quantities
can now be scaled in a natural manner; the reference distance a is given
by Kepler's third law, m w~a3 = e 2, and so on. We will call these the
classical units. The nature of the trajectories in phase space depends

330

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

on the value of the classically normalized energy, which will be given
the special symbol Ec.
When the transition to quantum mechanics is made, Planck's quantum enters as a fourth physical parameter, and can, therefore, be expressed in terms of the classical units in the problem. Among them is
the magnetic field B in this case, so that fi gets measured in terms of
m, e, and B. Clearly, it is now more natural to measure Bin terms of
m, e, and fi; for this purpose, we define y as the ratio of the ground state
fiwc/2 in the Landau spectrum (18.9), with the ground state of the
Kepler problem, 1 Ryd = me4 /21l 2 . Thus,
(18.11)
B = y ( m 2e 3cI fi 3) = y • 2.35 • 10 s Tesla ;
the speed of light c can be eliminated from this formula, because the
fine-structure constant e 2 /fic !::= 1/137 is a pure number. In terms of
these atomic units, the various quantities will be designated by their
usual symbols. In particular, if the energy E is measured in Rydbergs,
then the classically normalized energy Ec = E/y 2 13 •
This scaling argument has been made by a number of authors, e.g.,
Robnik (1982), Harada (1983), and Hasegawa (1983); but its impact
on the interpretation of experimental or computational spectra was
first realized by Wintgen and his coworkers (1987a and b), and we will
follow his line of reasoning. As a first step which has become the tradition in this trade, we use Hill's trick in the treatment of the lunar orbit
and give our coordinate system a uniform rotation of angular speed
n' = - wc/2 around the z-axis. A check with (5.11) shows that the
Zeeman term, WL Lz, is thereby eliminated from the Hamiltonian
(18.6). This transformation to rotating coordinates is an application
of Larmor's theorem in atomic physics and the frequency WL = wc/2
is known as the Larmor frequency WL = eB/2mc.
Cylindrical coordinates (p, cf>, z) are natural; the coordinates are
expressed in the atomic units, as stated above. (The classically scaled
distances are then obtained by multiplying with y 2 13 , momenta with
y- 113, time withy, angular momentum with y 113 ; and the value of the
classically scaled Hamiltonian Ec follows by dividing with y 2 13 .) The
Hamiltonian (18.6) becomes

which is measured in Rydbergs. In order to explain Wintgen's ingenious use of scaling, we continue his arguments in a somewhat simplified
form while giving concrete details about the computations.
Semiparabolic coordinates (JL, v) are used: p = (JL 2 - v2 )/2, z = JLV,
and r = (JL 2 + v2 )/2. Schrodinger's equation becomes

If we assume that E < 0 and fixed, the two first terms in (18.13) rep-

resent two decoupled two-dimensional harmonic oscillators of angular
momentum £z· The third term is a sixth-order perturbation, whereas
the last term, coming from the Coulomb potential, is simply a numerical constant.
Harmonic-oscillator wave functions are called for; they are used in
some standard form, wm(ll) and wn(v). Their matrix elements, for the
kinetic energy T = - 1:!.11- - f:lv, for the harmonic potential
V = (ll 2 + v2 ), and for the anharmonic potential W = ll 2 v2 (1l 2 + v2 )
are simple numbers. The corresponding matrices are very sparse, with
non-vanishing elements close to the diagonal. We are still able to pick
a scale b, which means that lJI(Il, v) is expanded in terms of the functions wm(ll/b)wn(v/b). The eigenvalue problem is now written as
[ b- 2 T- E b 2 V + (ib 6 /4)W- 4] 1J; = 0 ,
in terms of the standardized matrices T, V, and W.
There are different ways of choosing the scale b ; but if we want to
get back to the classically scaled energy Ec, we have to use b = y- 113 .
The condition for 1J; now becomes
[ Ec V - (1/4)W + 4] 1J; = 13 T!J; ,
(18.14)

i

where Ec is given some fixed value, while we try to find y such that
(18 .14) is satisfied.
The problem has been turned around: rather than to find the energy
levels for a given magnetic field B, we now determine the special values
of y 213 where an eigenstate exists for a given classically normalized
3 are found again by solving an
energy Ec . These special values

3 Ec. Another way of stating this result: in a plot of E
through E1 =
versus y, we get the intersections 'YJ of the curves Ej(y) with the curve

yJI

yJI

E

= y2/3 Ec.

The trace g(E) as defined in ( 17.4) becomes a function of y; the
typical denominator E- E1 is replaced by Ec(y 213 ·- yJI 3 ), where Ec
has a fixed value. If we use the trace formula ( 17.13) to evaluate the
classical approximation gc(E), the main object is to write the exponents
as functions of y.
The classical action S(E) around a particular periodic orbit depends
on the magnetic field in a very simple manner, once Ec is given. S(E)

332

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

in ( 17.13) is f p dq in atomic units; but since the classically normalized
energy Ec is held fixed while the magnetic field varies, it is natural to
evaluate S(E) in classical units, indicated by a bar, and then revert to
the atomic units.
In the discussion preceding (18.12), we stated that ij = y 2 13q and
p = y- 1/3p ; therefore,
1/3 (18.15)
~(Ec) = 2'1T(n + {3k),
Sk(E) = ywhere ~(Ec) depends on the periodic orbit (indexed by k), but is independent of y, because the magnetic field does not appear in the
Hamiltonian if classical units are used. The first equality simply relates
the action integral in the atomic and in the classical scale. The second
equality goes further, however, and applies the quantization rule for
integrable systems (14.4). The Maslov index f3k arises from the count
of conjugate points as usual. The conditions under which this last
equality is valid will be discussed at some length in Section 18.5.
To complete the discussion of the trace gc(E) according as (17 .13),
the amplitudes A also can be expressed in both systems of units. Thus,
the period To = y- 1~ , while the the stability exponent x and the
number of conjugate points do not depend on y at all. The remarkable
feature in this interpretation of (18 .15) is that the action is a linear
function of the variable y- 1/3.
Therefore, the trace formula gives the Fourier analysis of &(E) with
respect to the variable y- 1/ 3 . Such an analysis can be carried out directly on the experimental or computational density of states, p(E) at
constant Ec and varying magnetic field y- 113 . For the lack of a better
name, the variable in the Fourier transform PF is called y 113 ; a plot of
PF versus y 113 should then have strong spikes at y 113 = S(Ec) for any
periodic orbit at the clasically normalized energy Ec . The evidence for
this striking result will be discussed in the next section; in essence, the
rather chaotic looking spectrum of the diamagnetic Kepler problem can
then be understood in terms of the periodic orbits at the classically
normalized energy Ec .

18.5 Calculation of the Oscillator Strengths
The standard experiment for studying the energy levels in an atom or
a molecule is optical absorption. The frequency of the light can nowadays be very sharply controlled with the help of tunable lasers. If the
atom is initially in the state designated by !f>i, the probability for ending
up in the state designated by If>! rather than in some other state, is given
by the oscillator strength,

where Dop is the component of the dipole operator in the direction of
polarization of the absorbed light;< <f>JiDop ~i >is the matrix element
between the initial and final state. The reader will find this formula in
any textbook on modern optics; in the further development, we follow
the paper of Du and Delos (1988).
The interesting final states for the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field
are near the ionization threshold; the level density is very high, and it
is often not possible to separate out completely one particular state.
In order to define the proper average, we start with the formula (13.10)
for Green's function. Then we take the difference between its values
for E-+E + ie and E-+E- ie, exactly as in (17.6), but without the in.

over q fl = qI = q ; thus,
G,(q''q' E) = (i/2'1T) [G(q"q' E + ie)- G(q"q' E- ie)].
(18.17)
This function of the energy E is now smoothed with the help of a
function 8(£) which has a somewhat broadened peak near 0, and yields
(i(q" q' E) = JdE 8(E' -E) G,(q" q' E'). The smoothed oscillator
strength is defined as
f(E)

where the variables q" and q' in G, have been integrated over when the
matrix elements were calculated. The factor (E- EJ should be included into the smoothing operation (18.17); but it can be taken outside, if the smoothing function is narrow compared with the energy
difference E - Ei .
Green's function in (18.18) is now replaced by its classical approximation (12.28), to yield the classical oscillator strength.fc(E), exactly
as in the derivation of the trace formula ( cf. Section 17.4). There is
an important modification, however, which was first discussed in detail
by Du and Delos (1988). The initial state <f>i is close to the ground state
of the hydrogen atom. It extends over a few atomic units at best, while
the final states may have a radius 1000 times as large. The magnetic
field has very little effect on the initial state; the electron leaves the
neighborhood of the proton as in a pure Coulomb fic~ld. On the other
hand, the classical approximation to the hydrogen wave-functions near
the nucleus is poor, and it is better to use the exact Green's function
out to a distance of 50 atomic units. The computational labor is manageable, because the electron leaving the neighborhood of the nucleus

334

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

has an energy E ~ 0; the asymptotic form for the wave functions can
be used.
The electron is first represented by an outgoing wave for a small
distance. Then it follows a classical trajectory for the main part of its
journey. Finally, it reaches again the sphere of transition near the nucleus, and becomes an incoming wave. The integration over the initial
and the final coordinate with the dipole operator Dop takes place in the
wave region. The amplitude A for a particular trajectory consists,
therefore, of several factors: the dipole operator Dop at the departure
and at the arrival provides some dependence on the polarization of the
absorbed light, on the angular momentum of the trajectory, as well as
on the initial and final angle with respect to the z-axis. The trajectory
itself contributes a factor related to the stability exponent, just as in the
trace formula.
The critical energy dependence is in the phase factor, however,
which has the usual form: the action-integral S(E) = fp dq for the
whole trajectory, minus ., 12 for each conjugate point along the way.
Planck's constant li does not appear explicitly because we are using
atomic units. These trajectories are periodic only in the sense that they
start at the nucleus and end up there again, but the initial and the final
momenta may have different directions.
Delos and coworkers (1988) have investigated the structure of trajectories at low magnetic fields, in an effort to understand the transition from the elliptical, Kepler-type regime to the helical, Landau-type
behavior; bifurcations play a critical role. More generally, but in less
detail, Delande and Gay (1986a) have calculated surfaces of section
for different values of Ec. The first signs of chaos appear when
Ec~ -.5; the radial trajectory in z = 0 that was used in connection with
(18.10) is seemingly the last to become unstable, at Ec = -.127.
Around the ionization threshold, the orbits out of the nucleus and
back into it are isolated, i.e., they have only the energy as a continuous
parameter; moreover, they maintain their basic shape over a relatively
wide range of the energy, including E = 0. The magnetic field tends
to confine them, at least in the x, y - directions because of the
diamagnetic term in ( 18.12) and forces them to turn around rather than
to escape to infinity.
The phase S(E) is, therefore, written as an expansion in powers of
the energy, <I> + E T. The elementary relation (2.4) has been used
to get T = dS I dE; both the phase <I> and the period T are evaluated
at E = 0. The typical period Tis very large in atomic units; if it is expressed in classical units, i.e., in terms of the cyclotron period 2w I we,
it will be called Tc which is smaller by a factory. Du and Delos give a
list of 65 periodic orbits, probably all with Tc < 10; the list includes the

18.5 Calculation of the Oscillator Strengths

335

various factors that make up the amplitude A, as well as the period Tc
and the phase ~- They also provide a picture for each; since the classical angular momentum y 113 fz is negligible, the orbits are confined to
a plane through the z-axis. A coding scheme has been found only recently by Eckhardt and Wintgen ( 1990), a major achievement that will
be mentioned in Chapter 20.
The classical oscillator strength fc(E) is now given by a formal expression very much like the trace formula ( 17.13), but we still have to
carry out the smoothing operation which got us from (18.17) to
(18.18). Very reasonably, Du and Delos argue that the averaging over
an interval of width f:.E is achieved, if the summation over the periodic
orbits is restricted to T < 2'1T I t:.E. This idea will be given a mathematically clean expression in the next chapter on the basis of Selberg's
trace formula; but in the absence of a rigorous fommla, we continue
to depend on physical arguments.
The various ingredients from the last few paragraphs now yield

the individual orbits are distinguished by the index k, and are assumed
to be ordered according as their period Tk; the sine rather than the exponential appears because of (18.17). The finite resolution t:.E is
normal in a Fourier series such as (18.18), if the sum is limited toperiods smaller than 2'1T I t:.E.
The discussion in the preceding section was phrased in terms of the
usual trace g(E), whereas in the present section we have concentrated
on the oscillator strength f(E). In both cases, we derived a classical
expression for a quantum-mechanical function of the energy, with the
help of the same reasoning which went into the trace formula (17 .13).
The trace gc(E) in the preceding section was treated as the Fourier expansion of g(E) in the variable y- 1/ 3 for fixed Ec, whereas (18.19) is
the Fourier expansion of f(E) in the variable E. Th{~ scaling with the
help of y- 1/ 3 applies just as well to the oscillator strengthfc(E).
The expansion parameter y- 113 has been interpreted so far as relating mostly to the magnetic field B through (18.11). Another view
has a wider range of application, although it seems rather artificial: at
a fixed value of B, the parameter y- 113 varies as 1I Jl. Wintgen's use
of the trace formula is tantamount to a Fourier series in 1/fi, where
each term exp(iSI!i) corresponds to the frequency S, and 1lfi plays the
role of time. The classical limit appears in the same light as a Fourier
series in the limit of large time.

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

18.6 The Chaotic Spectrum in Terms of Closed Orbits
The Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field has inversion symmetry through the origin, and is, therefore, expected to obey
Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) statistics in spite of the lacking
time reversal, because the Hamiltonian (18.6) is symmetric with respect to inversion at the origin. This fact has been confirmed through
numerical calculations of the spectrum in strong fields by Wintgen and
Friedrich (1986) as well as Delande and Gay (1986a), although there
are deviations in the higher-order correlations such as the rigidity.
Poisson statistics applies in the low-field region as expected, so that the
Diamagnetic Kepler Problem provides a fine example of a transition in
the spectrum from integrable to chaotic.
Optical absorption in a beam of hydrogen atoms going through a
strong magnetic field can be measured with very high resolution. The
reader has to study the experimental details in the papers of the group
working in Bielefeld comprising Welge and his coworkers, in particular
Holle et al. (1986) and Main et al. (1986). The spectrum can be sorted
out experimentally into a fixed angular momentum and parity both in
the initial and in the final state. Many of the lines are as narrow as .1
em- 1 which is the resolution of the UV-laser, and are spread over a
typical range of 60 em- 1 A layperson looking at a plot of the output
signal such as Figure 52, cannot help but call this kind of data chaotic,
although it is quite reproducible.
The reliability of these results comes out very clearly, when they
are compared with the spectrum which is obtained from diagonalizing
a large matrix such as (18.14). The agreement is excellent, as shown
in the work of Wintgen et al.( 1986), covering dozens of lines, including
their oscillator strengths; more such comparisons are given in Holle et
al. (1987). Still, these results only show that Schrodinger's equation
gives the correct foundation, but they do not really help us gain any
insight into the physical processes involved.
The argument of Edmonds (1970), leading to the formula (18.10),
is certainly a step in the right direction; it was put into a more convincing form by R~inhardt (1983). He started from a formula for the
dipole photo-absorption cross-section quoted by Heller ( 197 8),

(18.18); it uses the propagator Krather than Green's function G, and
emphasizes the time development of the dipole moment.

argument; any reliance on classical trajectories leads to the same results
as in the past two sections.
This kind of analysis got a big boost when Holle et al. (1986) made
a complete Fourier analysis of their data and found a second peak
corresponding to a level spacing of .64 liwc, in addition to the spacing

338

The Diamagnetic Kepler Problem

of 1.5 liwc. These authors also identified the classical orbit leading to
this spacing: it takes off in the nucleus at a 54° angle with respect to the
xy-plane; its projection into that plane is not a straight line; its period
is, of course, longer than for the purely radial orbit, and accounts for
the reduced spacing of .64 liwc. Further spacings of this kind were
found by Main et al. (1986), and some beautiful pictures of these orbits
are given in Main et al. (1987).
Du and Delos ( 1987) were the first to make a more detailed analysis
of the Bielefeld data on the basis of the theory in the preceding section.
A particularly critical element in their calculation is the phase <})k in
(18 .19), which is a large number in the atomic units whose value,
however, is important only modulo 2'TT. It turned out that two otherwise unrelated orbits, with separately large amplitudes Ak, had very
close periods Tk. Their phases, however, differed almost exactly by 'TT,
so that their combined amplitude was small after all, in agreement with
the optical data!
Recently, the experiments have been modified; the frequency of the
UV -laser is varied at the same time as changing the magnetic field, so
as to keep Ec = E/y 213 constant; the scaling of Section 18.4 is built
into the apparatus! The Fourier analysis with respect to r-=21 3 is carried
out as explained in Section 18.4, and yields the values of Sk(Ec).
Holle et al. (1988) have varied Ec in small steps from -.5 to +.2 ;
the values of y 113 where the Fourier amplitude is large, lead to a set of
curves in the Ec versus y 113 plane which gives a good picture of the
classical orbit structure. The authors have identified a number of
classes of orbits, called primary vibrators, primary rotators, and "exotics," whose representatives can be followed from the regular into the
chaotic region, including various bifurcations. The origin of the chaotic
features in the experimental spectrum is, therefore, directly related to
the classical orbits. Figure 53 shows both the experimental spectrum
and its Fourier transform with respect to y- 113 ; the most prominent
peaks are identified with closed orbits.
In contrast to the original analysis which led to the quasi-Landau
spectrum by Garton and Tomkins (1969), the regularities associated
with the classical orbits are not easily recognized in the output signals
of these more sophisticated experiments. The classical periodic orbits
manifest themselves as correlations that are found when the spectrum
is subjected to a Fourier analysis.
The analysis has not been pushed to the point where the confusing
set of sharp peaks can be shown to result directly from a superposition
of terms as in (18.19) that would require very many terms with long
periods, i.e., a much smaller energy interval/lB. The second equality
in (18.15) gives a qualitative idea of the physical process leading to the

formation of regular features in the spectrum, such as the bunching of
energy levels at the intervals specified in ( 18.19); but this relation does
not give us the exact location of approximate eigenvalues, as one expects from the WKB quantization condition.
The apparent fallacy of quantizing a single isolated periodic orbit
was mentioned at the end of Section 17.9, and appears now in a new
light. The condition (18.15) gives the energies in whose neighborhood
the level density is higher than average. The shortest periodic orbits
have the strongest effect. In intervals of low average level density, as
at the bottom of the spectrum, they may even yield the individual energy levels, as happened in the author's earliest work on the
Anisotropic Kepler Problem (Gutzwiller 1971). It may not be possible
to recognize such short periodic orbits in the lowest eigenstates, however, because the corresponding wave functions have long wave lengths
and very little structure.

CHAPTER 19

Motion on a Surface of
Constant Negative Curvature

The first concrete example of a dynamical system with hard chaos was
given by Jacques Hadamard in 1898. Although he was primarily a
geometer, to use the traditional name for the members of the mathematics section in the French Academy of Sciences, he saw the physical
application immediately. A short account of his work in the same year
carries the title, On the billiard game on a surface of negative curvature.
His arguments are all given in the language of differential geometry;
this field started as the study of arbitrary two-dimensional curved surfaces imbedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Hadamard
chose to express himself in this manner and make his ideas easily accessible and intuitively appealing. As a bonus, he shows that all the
important features in this model depend on the curvature being negative, but not necessarily constant, and that most of the reasoning can
be phrased in terms of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (19.10).
While this approach is very helpful to the student who likes to have
a picture to fix her ideas, it does not embrace some interesting examples
of hard chaos; they can only be reached in the more abstract setting
of Riemannian geometry. Indeed, Hilbert (1901) proved that it is not
possible to imbed a smooth, compact, and complete surface of strictly
negative curvature into three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 .
Poincare and Klein, on the other hand, gave very simple and effective constructions of such two-dimensional Riemannian spaces of
constant negative curvature as polygons in the hyperbolic geometry of

Lobatchevsky. If the reader gets terrified by the idea of non-Euclidean
geometry, he should devote some time to get acquainted with
Poincare's model. The basic concepts of Euclidean geometry, such as
straight lines, angles, translations, and rotations around a point, are all
represented by traditional objects; in particular, nothing more complicated than ordinary circles are ever used and all the classical problems
can be solved by elementary means.
The calculations in this model are also reduced to what must be a
minimum of algebraic complication, namely dealing with groups of 2
by 2 real matrices, normalized to have a determinant = 1. Most remarkably, an amazing variety of different possibilities and phenomena
is contained in this seemingly tight, mathematical framework. The author (Gutzwiller 1980) was the first to emphasize that the many results
of hyperbolic geometry, in particular Selberg's trace formula (19.20),
are of central importance for the understanding of quantum chaos.
Although a systematic account of this rich field cannot be condensed
into one chapter, the essential ingredients will be presented to make
some of the recent work by physicists accessible to the reader.
The whole discussion will be limited to two dimensions. Some of
the methods can be generalized to three dimensions, while keeping the
elementary character of the Poincare model. A first step in this direction has been taken by Tomaschitz (1989), but there are significant
differences, both geometric and algebraic, that would require a whole
new chapter to explain (cf. Gutzwiller 1985b).
The goal is twofold: On the one hand, Selberg's trace formula is
explained in some detail, because it is the testing ground for the more
general form (17 .13) of the trace formula; the relation between classical and quantum mechanics in a chaotic system has to be understood
in this special context. On the other hand, the possibly chaotic features
of quantum mechanics itself, whatever they turn out to be, have a better chance to manifest themselves on surfaces of negative curvature
than anywhere else; also, they may be more easily computed thanks to
Poincare's model, as will be demonstrated explicitly in a scattering
problem.

19.1 Mechanics in a Riemannian Space
A particle of mass m which moves with velocity v on the surface of a
sphere of radius R, experiences a force directed toward the center of
the sphere, and equal to mv2 I R. If the surface is a triaxial ellipsoid, the
force keeping the particle there is given by (3.9) with (3.10). This view

342

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

of a particle, as being forced to stay on the given surface S by applying
the appropriate force along the normal, is unnecessarily complicated;
the equations of motion for the particle can be written directly in terms
of the two intrinsic coordinates on the surface, without using the third,
extrinsic coordinate.
The extrinsic coordinate is ambiguous in most cases; not only can
the location of S in R 3 be shifted, and its orientation turned; but it can
be deformed without in any way changing the trajectories with respect
to the intrinsic coordinates. It takes a rather difficult theorem to show
that a complete surface of strictly positive curvature, like the sphere
or the ellipsoid, can actually not be deformed; but an incomplete one,
like one-half of a grapefruit shell, or any piece of negative curvature,
can be deformed 'isometrically', a term to be explained shortly along
with the concept of completeness for a surfaceS.
Before going on, however, the notion of curvature has to be defined.
It starts again from imbedding the surface Sin R 3 ; at the point P we
erect the normal, and provide it with a direction called 'inward'. A
plane in R3 containing the normal, intersects Sin a curve C which has
a well-defined curvature " in P, positive if C is turned inward, and
negative if C is turned outward. As the plane through the normal is
allowed to rotate around the normal, " has a maximum value "I and a
minimum value K 2 . The Gaussian curvature K at P is defined as
K = "I"2·
If K > 0, the surface looks locally like a sphere, although it would

be more exact to compare it locally to an ellipsoid; similarly, if
K < 0, the surface looks locally like a piece of the one-sheeted
hyperboloid, i.e., like the top of a mountain pass. An approximate description of S in R 3 near P would have to specify not only K, but also
the mean curvature (KI + K2 )/2; the neighborhood of a point on an
ellipsoid (where "I :F K2) may look quite different from a point on the
sphere (where "I = K2 ), since the mean curvatures are different, even
though K = "I" 2 is the same.
Gauss discovered that K is all that matters when only the intrinsic
properties of a surface are of interest, i.e., those that are independent
of the wayS is imbedded in R3; it is called his theorema egregium where
the word egregious has its original meaning as 'outstanding'. In particular, the geodesics on S, the shortest connections between two, not
too distant, points do not depend on the mean curvature; they are also
the trajectories of a particle which moves freely on S.
The intrinsic description of an /-dimensional Riemannian space is
made in terms of the position coordinates q = (q 1 , ... , qf), and the
local metric ds. In an obvious generalization of Pythagoras's theorem,

19.1 Mechanics in a Riemannian Space

the distance of two neighboring points is given by a quadratic function
in the differentials,

where the metric tensor gjk is a sufficiently smooth function of the coordinates q.
Two Riemannian spaces, the first with coordinates q' and metric

called isometric if there exists a transformation q' -• q'' = h(q') such
that the distance elements ds' and ds" become equal.
The volume-element is dV =
dq1 ...dqf with g = det(gjk). A direction at a point q is given by a unit vector u = (u1 , ... , Uf) where

The tensor gjk is the inverse of gjk , i.e., Lgp gfk = 13jk .
The metric tensor is symmetric, and positive definite in Riemannian
geometry; in the better known application of Riemannian geometry to
general relativity, the metric tensor is semidefinite, with one positive
and three negative eigenvalues, as in the relativistic Hamiltonian (7 .11)
of the electron. Except for the formal similarities, such as for a
Hamiltonian like (7 .11), and the resulting equations of motion, the two
situations are entirely different; we will strictly adhere to the assumption of a positive definite metric. Also, except where stated explicitly,
we will stay with two dimensions, f = 2.
The curve r in the Riemannian space which is defined by a solution
of the equations of motion (1. 3) resulting from the Lagrangian (19. 2),
or (2.2) from the Hamiltonian (19.3), is called a geodesic. The integral
f ds along a geodesic, with ds given by (19.1), defines a length; distances in a Riemannian space will always be measured along a geodesic.
Since the velocity for the particle is defined as v = ds/ dt, its energy
becomes simply E = mv2 /2 as in Euclidean space. A Riemannian

344

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

space is called complete if every geodesic can be continued indefinitely,
as on a sphere, but not on a half -sphere.
If s is the distance from q' to q", as measured along a geodesic which
joins these two points, we find for Hamilton's principal function R and
for the action integral S,
R(q" q' t) = m s 2 /2t , S(q" q' E) = /2mE s , (19.4)
in exact agreement with (1.5) and (2.5) in Euclidean space.
The equations of motion for a geodesic through an arbitrary point
Po can be solved in powers of the timet, if we expand the metric tensor
gJk in powers of the coordinate difference q1 - q01 . In this way, we
obtain geodesic circles centered in Po as the locus of points at a fixed
distance r from P0 . The length L of the circumference, and the area A
of such a circle, become
L = 2'TTr- 'TTKr 3/ 3 + ... , A = 'TTr 2 - 'TTKr 4/ 12 + ... , (19.5 )
where the omitted terms in the expansions have higher powers in r.
The coefficient K combines various derivatives (up to the second) of
the metric tensor, all evaluated at P0 ; it is the Gaussian curvature at
P0 , which is now seen to have a simple, intrinsic, geometric meaning.
Obviously, such a definition makes no longer any reference to an imbedding in Euclidean space R 3 .
Let now r 0 be some fixed geodesic, and write its coordinates as a
function of the distance s measured along it; then consider a geodesic
r nearby. Through the point P on r 0 with the distance parameters,
draw the geodesic perpendicular to r o, until it intersects r; the distance
t(s) between the two geodesics at Pis defined thereby. The differential
equation for r, as obtained from the equations of motion for the particle, can be reduced to a linear second-order equation for t(s), in
lowest order with respect to the distance between r and r 0 ,
(19.6)
d 2t(s)/di = - K(s) t(s).
The coefficient K(s) is again the Gaussian curvature in P.
This relation is sometimes called Jacobi's equation; it may be used
to define the Gaussian curvature K at P. It tells us to what extent the
neighboring geodesic r gets pulled back toward f 0 if K > 0, or pushed
away from r 0 if K < 0. Thus, the Gaussian curvature K becomes a
local measure of the stability of the geodesic; K > 0 as on the sphere
means stability, whereas K < 0 implies instability; log/[( plays the
role of the Lyapounoff exponent in (1.6) or again in (10.7).

19.2 Poincare's Model of Hyperbolic Geometry
The hyperbolic world as first imagined and investigated by
Lobatchevski and Bolyay in the first half of the nineteenth century is
not so different from our own Euclidean world. It has all the familiar
objects, like straight lines and planes, and most importantly, it has the
same basic symmetries which lead to a six-parameter invariance group
of translations and rotations; distances and angles are defined in anatural manner. Can we draw pictures of it, even if they are distorted?
Among several equivalent models, we will use only Poincare's upper
half-plane U for the two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry because it
is technically the easiest to handle. There is a three-dimensional generalization that is even more amazing in its hidden richesse; but much
more work on the classical as well as on the quantal aspects has been
done in two dimensions. There is obviously still a large field waiting
to be explored.
Poincare's model can be approached from several directions; e.g.,
Balazs and Voros (1986) start with one sheet of a two-sheeted
hyperboloid in three dimensions, which they call the pseudosphere. We
will get straight to the final product: a Euclidean plane with a Cartesian
coordinate system (x, y), where we consider only the upper half y > 0.
There is a slight semantic problem with the names of the geometric
objects: since we are dealing with a model, one familiar object like a
circle in Euclidean geometry may represent a completely different object like a straight line in hyperbolic geometry. We will, therefore, attach the adjective 'Euclidean' or 'hyperbolic' whenc:!ver necessary, so
that the reader knows which one of the two interpretations is called for.
The points in U are best designated by a complex number
z = x + iy withy > 0; but we will not limit our attention to analytic
functions, also called harmonic functions f(x, y) satisfying Laplace's
equation t5:..f = 0, as is usual in the theory of complex variables. The
complex notation is useful, however, when the translations and rotations of the hyperbolic plane are investigated.
Hyperbolic geometry is invariant with respect to the Mobius transformations
az + b
z .... z ' =
with a d - b c == 1 ,
(19.7)
cz + d
where a, b, c, dare real numbers. It is easy to check that these transformations form a group under the usual multiplication of 2 by 2 matrices; we will write those sometimes in the flattened notation
[a, b; c, d ].

346

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

There are three continuous parameters in this group of Special (because their determinant = 1) Linear (if applied to vectors rather than
complex numbers) transformations of 2-component Real vectors
SL(2,R). When the quotient with{±/} is formed in (19.7), this group
is reduced to its Projective normal subgroup PSL(2,R) =
SL(2,R)/ { ± I}, also called the Mobius group. This group plays the
same role in hyperbolic geometry as the group of rotations in spherical
geometry, and the translation-rotation group in Euclidean geometry.
The distance s between two points, z 1 and z2, is given by the formula
dx2 + dy2

The second equation is obtained, if the left-hand side of the first
equation is expanded ins, and the right-hand side is expanded in powers of the coordinate differences; this metric is easily checked to keep
the same functional form under the transformation (19.7).
The angle a between two directions in hyperbolic geometry is the
same as the Euclidean angle of the corresponding two directions in U;
the model is, therefore, called conformal. The lengths, however, are
badly distorted. Notice that all the points on the x-axis are infinitely
far away, and so is the point at infinity, i.e., y-+oo while x = constant.
The integral f dy/y for the length along they-axis does not converge
as y goes either to 0, or to oo.
The geodesics are represented by Euclidean circles whose center is
on the real axis; they play the role of the straight lines. They are infinitely long; but in this model, they can be given two end-points, namely
the coordinates on the real axis, ~ and 1J, where the corresponding
Euclidean circle intersects the real axis. If these geodesics become the
trajectory for a particle, then there is a direction of motion. We will,
therefore, adopt the convention that the particle comes from ~ and
moves toward 1J, as in Figure 54a.
Instead of Poincare's upper half -plane U, it is sometimes convenient
to use a closely related model, also due to Poincare; U with coordinates
z = x + iy is mapped along with all its geometric objects into the unit
circle u 2 + v2 < 1 with the complex coordinates w = u + iv through
. 1 - w

(19.9)
w =
,z=z1+w·
z + i
Since circles go into circles in such bilinear maps of the complex plane,
and angles are preserved in any analytic map, the geodesics are now
represented by Euclidean circles which intersect the unit circle at a
right angle, as shown in Figure 54b. The metric in the unit circle is
given be ds 2 = 4(du 2 + dv2)j(1 - u2 -v2)2.

Figure 54 A straight line in Poincare's model of hyperbolic geometry is a
Euclidean circle that intersects the boundary at a right angle, (a) in the upper
half-plane U as well as (b) in the unit circle; the free motion of a particle goes
from the point~ on the boundary to the point 11·
The typical reasoning in hyperbolic geometry may be illustrated by
the following example: Let us try to calculate the curvature at some
arbitrary point z in U ! As a first step, z is moved into the point i ; according as (19.7), this requires finding [a, b; c, d] such that
z = x + iy = (ai + b)/(ci +d) with ad- be= 1. There is more than
one solution; this ambiguity simply means that we are still free to rotate
around the point i. Now we go into the unit circle with (19.9) so that
i goes into w = 0. The geodesics through 0 are represented by the
Euclidean straight lines, and there is circular symmetry around the origin; the hyperbolic distance of a point w = u + i 0 from the origin is
r = 2jdu/(1 - u2 ), so that u = tanh(r/2). The hyperbolic circumference of a geodesic circle with radius r is L = 2'17" 2u/(1 - u2 ); if we
insert for u its value in terms of r, it follows that L = 2'17" Sinh(r).
Finally, we apply (19.5) to find the Gaussian curvature K = - 1.
One could have used a general formula forK in terms of the metric
tensor gjk and its derivatives; this might have entailed some tedious, but
not difficult calculations. Instead, we have used first the translational
invariance to move z into i, and then the invariance with respect to rotations around the origin in the unit-circle model. The calculations
become almost trivial, and they allow us to understand the overall picture much better.

19.3 The Construction of Polygons and Tilings
A polygon in Riemannian geometry is a simply connected domain of
finite area whose boundaries are geodesics, i.e., straight lines. This
definition applies to the familiar Euclidean plane, as well as to the
hyperbolic plane, and to the sphere where the great circles play the role
of straight lines. A polygon is said to tile the plane if its isometric
copies can be arranged so as to cover the whole plane without gaps or
overlaps. There are many polygons in all three cases; but in the
Euclidean plane and on the sphere, only very few of them are able to
tile the whole available space. As a consequence, the trace formula for
integrable systems hardly ever applies, as discussed at some length in
Section 17 .3.
There is a very general formula for the area of polygons in
Riemannian spaces, which is the global version of Jacobi's equation
(19.6). Consider ann-sided polygon with the vertices Ph ... , Pn, enclosing the simply connected domain D; it is assumed to be on the left
as one goes counterclockwise around the polygon, as shown in Figure
55. The tangent vector has to rotate counterclockwise through the
outer angle aj at the vertex Pj ; we will restrict this angle to
- 'IT < aj :S + 'IT, although one could allow larger or smaller angles at
the price of considering multiple coverings of D.
The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that

J

K dS = 2'1T-

L aj;

(19.10)

j

in words, the sum of the outer angles fails to add up to 2'1T by the
amount f K dS, i.e., the total Gaussian curvature inside D.
This proposition contains as a special case the statement from elementary geometry (K = 0) that the sum of the inner angles equals 'IT in
a triangle, whereas in spherical geometry (K = 1/R 2 ), the area equals
(2'1T - ~aj) R 2 . In hyperbolic geometry, this last relation is reversed
since we get the area of a polygon as (~aj- 2'1T)/ I Kl. We will pay
special attention to singular polygons in the last sections of this chapter,
where aj = 'IT; the vertex Pj is then located on the real axis of U or at
oo.

The simplest kind of tiling is obtained as follows: copies of the original polygon are translated and rotated so as to join along boundaries,
until a simply connected domain is filled without gaps or overlaps. In
the case of the sphere, a finite number of polygons fills out the full area
of 4'1T; the most famous tilings are the projections onto a concentric
sphere of the five regular polyhedra , tetrahedron, cube, etc.; but there

are others which can be derived from them. If the radius of the sphere
is fixed at 1, none of these tilings has a further parameter to vary.
The Euclidean plane is already much trickier. If we insist on the
required translations and rotations of the original polygon forming a
group, there are very few groups, although the shapes of the polygons
can vary within certain limits. The group property is the crucial ingredient in finding an integrable system and being able to apply the
method of images. Some tilings have a continuous parameter besides
a scale, e.g., parallelograms with different angles and side ratios. Quite
recently, tilings of the Euclidean plane without the group property have
been discovered and are studied extensively (cf. Grtinbaum and
Shephard 1987); some of these are projections of regular tilings in
spaces of higher dimensions. Maybe some method of images still applies, and the trace formula takes on a pseudointegrable appearance.
There is a large variety of tilings in the hyperbolic plane, all of them
with continuous parameters besides the Gaussian curvature; we will set
K = - 1 henceforth. The construction of a tiling polygon will be explained in this section; but we will not attempt to show how to obtain
all possible tilings. The octagon F will be our principal example for a
compact tile; the simplest non-compact tile of finite area will be
disussed in Section 19.7. A slight knowledge of topology will be helpful; but every reader will be able to follow the simple arguments.
The transformations (19. 7) preserve the orientation; we will not
consider reflexion symmetries in this simple discussion; the polygons

350

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

will always be moved from one location to another by pushing them
around, without ever lifting them off the plane and flipping them over.
The circumference of the octogon F will be given a counterclockwise orientation, so that the interior is to the left of a person
traveling in the prescribed sense. There is an even number of sides, and
they are associated in pairs; for the discussion of the octogon, let us call
the corresponding segments, including their orientation, a and a', f3 and
/31 , y andy', 8 and 8'. A picture (see Figure 56) of the octogon is easier
to draw, if the hyperbolic plane is represented by the inside of the unit
circle, i.e., after mapping U according as (19.9). Each side of the
octogon is part of a Euclidean circle which intersects the unit circle at
a right angle; the order of the sides is important.
A copy of the original octogon F is moved around in the hyperbolic
plane until one side of the copy is brought into congruence with its
partner in the original octogon; e.g., a in the copy is brought into
congruence with a' in the original. Notice that when the two octogons
are put next to each other, the arrow on a in the copy points in the direction opposite to the arrow on a' in the original. If a curve is trying
to leave the original octogon through the side a', it reenters the copy
through the side a. If we want to continue showing the curve in the
original octogon, we have to transform the neighborhood of a' back
into a; the name for this operation is A. Similarly, we define the operations B: /3-/3', C: y' -y, and D: 8-8'; notice the slight differences
in these definitions.
Thus, four hyperbolic transformations, A, B, C, and D, each given
by a 2 by 2 real matrix of determinant 1, have to be found to define the
four congruence operations for the octogon. Among the many possibilities, we will discuss only the assignment in Figure 56, where the
counterclockwise sequence of the sides is a f3 a' /31 y 8 y' 8'. Will this
assignment give a tiling of the hyperbolic plane? This question can be
answered if we know how the various copies of the original fill out the
angle 2'11' around a particular vertex. Again without going into the
deeper reasons for this crucial step in the argument, let us just follow
the recipe. The reader will find an exhaustive, yet readable account of
this combination of geometry and algebra in the textbook of Beardon
(1983).
Suppose that we are trying to go counterclockwise around the vertex numbered 1 in Figure 56, where the side 81 joins the side a, starting
in Po on a and moving as indicated by the little arrow. When our little
circuit hits 81 , we have to move over to 8 using the operation D- 1 ,
which brings us near the vertex called 2 in Figure 56. Now we continue
to go counterclockwise, but this time around the vertex 2, until we hit
the side y, and we have to move over to y' with the help of c- 1 so as

to continue our trip around the vertices. We are now near the vertex
3, and will hit the side 8 before long, as we go counter-clockwise; the
operation D then gets us to the vertex 4 on ll. As we continue
counterclockwise around 4, we hit y' and need C to get to vertex 5 on
y, and so on.
Eventually, after the counterclockwise journey around vertex 8 has
been completed, and the operation A has brought us back to a near
vertex 1, we find ourselves in a point P 1, which is a copy of the starting
point P0 • The neighborhood of Po has undergone a succession of
transformations, first D- 1, followed by c- 1, then D, etc., and ultimately A. By the vicissitudes of the customary notation, this whole
sequence gets its name in the reverse order, ABA- lB-lCDC-lD-l.
The eight vertices of the octogon are now recognized as representing only one single point. Similarly, each side and its partner can be
viewed as one segment, if we agree to deal with the octogon in the
hyperbolic plane in the same manner as with a parallelogram in the
Euclidean plane, and identify opposite sides. In a somewhat strained

352

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

analogy with polyhedra, the octogon F has effectively v = 1 vertices,
e = 4 edges, and of course, f = 1 faces. Euler's celebrated theorem
tells us that, viewed as a surface, the octogon has the genus g given by
2(g- 1) = - f + e- v = 2, i.e., the octogon is equivalent to the surface of a sphere with two handles. The reader will find proofs of this
formula, as well as an explanation of the other concepts from topology,
such as the homotopy group in the next section, in any introductory
textbook on topology, e.g., Seifert and Threlfall 1934 (with English
translation 1980), Lefschetz 1949, Hocking and Young 1961. An
equally instructive demonstration can be found in figuring out a few
special examples like the sphere or the torus.
Figure 57 shows such a surface imbedded in R3; we will also call it
a double torus henceforth. It can be converted into a simply connected
domain by making four cuts, all of which start at the same point P, and
return to it, as indicated in the figure. If the sides of each cut are given
the names a and a', f3 and 13', and so on, and the double torus is laid out
flat, the reader will recognize our octogon F of Figure 56; it is like
stretching out flat the hide of an animal. All these arguments, although
quite elementary and intuitive, may take a while to sink into the reader's mind.
To what extent can F in the hyperbolic plane be compared to the
double torus of Figure 57 ? It is natural to associate the single vertex
of the octogon with the point P on the double torus from which the four
cuts were made. P does not have any distinguishing features; it belongs
to a neighborhood where the double torus is smooth. In particular the
eight corners, which come from the four cuts, fit together so as to fill
out the full angle of 2'11 around P. The same situation has to obtain for
the octogon.
The condition to be imposed on the octogon requires, therefore,
that upon completion of the circuit around the vertex, the neighborhood of the starting point Po in the hyperbolic plane coincides with the
neighborhood of the endpoint PI; or equivalently,
ABA-I B-I CDC-I D-I = J(ldentiy),
(19.11)
in terms of the 2 by 2 matrices. This condition also insures that the
eight angles on the vertices ofF add up to 2'11; we shall not attempt to
show that this condition is indeed sufficient for the tiling.
Since the sum of the inner angles in the octogon equal 2'11, the outer
angles add up to 6'11; the Gauss-Bonnet theorem yields, therefore, the
area 4'11 for the double torus, the same as for the sphere. As a consequence, Weyl's formula tells us that the average density of states for
the Laplacian on the double torus is 1. The simplest realization of the
octogon makes all the inner eight angles equal to 'IT I 4; the octogon then

takes the regular shape shown in Figure 56; we will rder to this special
case as the regular octogon.
It is important to count the number of parameters which this construction allows us to choose freely. Each real 2 by 2 matrix with determinant = 1 has three parameters; since we have to find four such
matrices, there are twelve unknowns to be determined. The equation
( 19.11) spells out the equality of two matrices, where the condition on
the determinant = 1 is already satisfied on both sides; thus, (19 .11)
represents three independent algebraic equations for the matrix elements of A, B, C, and D. The location of the octogon in the hyperbolic
plane is not relevant; two solutions of (19.11), A, ... and A', ... , describe the same octogon, if they differ only by a change of coordinates,
A' = T- 1 A T, where Tis an arbitrary regular matrix. Therefore, with
twelve unknowns, three algebraic equations, and three parameters to
locate and orient the octogon in the hyperbolic plane, we are left with
six essential parameters.
A systematic procedure to define these six parameters in terms of
certain natural quantities on the double torus has been discussed by
Keen (1966a and b). One particular choice is shown in Figure 58: the
six closed loops, C 1 , ... , C6 , are topologically different; as will be discussed in the next section, there is exactly one closed geodesic (periodic
orbit) for each such topologically independent loop. The lengths of
these six closed geodesics, r 1 ' ... , r 6. determine the shape of the
octogon. Two octogons with different sets of these lengths are not
isometric, i.e., they cannot be mapped into each other so that the length
of all corresponding curves is preserved.

354

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

Figure 58 Six closed loops whose minimal length uniquely characterize a
double torus; they can be interpreted as giving the physical parameters for a
particle that is trapped in a two-dimensional double well.

Although this six-parameter family of double tori was constructed
in a rather abstract manner, it has an appealing physical interpretation.
Each torus represents a box in which the particle moves; these two
boxes are coupled by the pipe connecting them. The shape of each box
is specified by two parameters, the lengths of r 1 and r 2 for the first
box, and the lengths of r 5 and r 6 for the second box; notice that a
Euclidean box, i.e., a parallelogram, is also specified by two parameters
in addition to a scale. Finally, the pipe between them is specified by its
length as given by the length of r 3 , and by its circumference as given
by the length of r 4 • The octagon is seen as a purely geometric model
for a particle in a two-dimensional double well, with all the freedom to
imitate the various features of a realistic physical situation, such as the
hindered rotation in a molecule.

19.4 The Geodesics on a Double Torus
The construction of the geodesis on a surface of negative curvature is
closely related to its topology, as Hadamard (1898) was the first to
recognize; the essential tool is the homotopy group G which was invented by Poincare. A point like P in Figure 57 is chosen; the four
oriented loops a, {3, y, and 8 are defined so as to start in P and return
to it; every other contour r on the double torus, from P and back, can
be obtained by deforming continuously a particular sequence of a, {3,
y, 8, and their inverses.
These oriented contours form a group; the product of two contours,
f 1f 2 , is the contour which first follows f 1, and then r 2 ; the inverse,

19.4 The Geodesics on a Double Torus

355

r -I, is the contour r with its orientation reversed. There are many

equivalent contours which can be deformed into one another by continuous deformation, without changing the orientation; the elements
of the homotopy group G are the classes of equivalent contours. On a
complete surface of negative curvature, there is exactly one geodesic, from
P and back, for each element in the homotopy group.
The existence of such a geodesic may be a problem for the mathematicians; but the uniqueness follows immediately from Morse's theorem in Section 1.5. If fo is a geodesic from P and back, belonging to
a particular element of the homotopy group, then a neighboring
geodesic r satisfies Jacobi's equation (19.5). If both start in P, they
will not intersect anymore; there are no conjugate points when the
Gaussian curvature K < 0. Therefore, the second variation of the
length of r 0 is positive; the geodesic realizes a minimum in its equivalence class of contours. There is no second minimum of this kind,
because if the first geodesic could be deformed continuously into the
second, they would be separated by a contour with vanishing first variation, i.e., a geodesic, but not with a positive definite second variation.
The trace formula requires a knowledge of the periodic orbits, or
equivalently, of the geodesics which close smoothly after a finite
length. If a particular equivalence class of contours is chosen, and the
point Pis varied continuously, the length of the geodesic in this class
has a first-order variation with respect to the displacement of P. If the
space of negative curvature is not only complete, however, but also
compact, there is a minimum with respect to the variation of P, yielding
a unique closed (periodic) geodesic.
There is no maximum of length in the particular equivalence class,
however, because there is no upper limit to lengths of the geodesics,
asP is allowed to roam freely. As an example, we might start with a
very short geodesic loop like a in Figure 59. Then Pis taken on a trip
around the double torus. When it passes by its original place, it can
be said to have followed along the contours of some equivalence class,
say 7". Thus, by letting P run around without restrictions, the class a
has become the class T- 1a'T, where 'T can be any element of the
homotopy group G. Quite generally in group theory, two elements {3
and T- 1a'T are called conjugate. A periodic orbit is, therefore, defined
by a conjugacy class of the homotopy group G.
The actual construction of a particular periodic geodesic in the
octogon of Figure 56 is not difficult; let us take the conjugacy class of
{3 as an example. The side {3 can be viewed as going from a to a'; but
it is not the shortest connection between these two sides, because otherwise it would cut both of them at a right angle. The problem, therefore, is to find a Euclidean circle that intersects the boundary of the

356

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

Figure 59 The original contour a on the double torus is deformed by moving
the point P around the contour T; the resulting contour, starting and ending
again in P, belongs to the element,.- 1aT of the homotopy group G, and to
the same conjugacy class as a.
hyperbolic plane (unit circle or real axis) at right angles, and does so
also for a and a'. The solution, either geometrically or algebraically,
is straightforward; it can also be interpreted as finding the shortest loop
around the right-hand torus in Figure 57.
Before getting the same information directly out of the 2 by 2 matrices A, B, C, and D, the elements of the group SL(2,R) have to be
put into equivalence classes. For this purpose, we look at the fixed
points; they result from (19. 7) by setting z' = z , which yields a quadratic equation in z; its discriminant is D = (a + d) 2 - 4. Three cases
arise:
i) elliptic for Ia + d I < 2: there is a single fix-point in the upper
half-plane U; if it is shifted into i, and thence into the origin of the
unit circle, the transformation becomes a rotation around the origin by an angle cp where cos(cp) = (a + d)/2;

19.4 The Geodesics on a Double Torus

357

ii) parabolic for I a + d I = 2: there is one fix-point which is located on the real axis; if it is shifted to oo, the transformation becomes the Euclidean translation z' = z + b ;
iii) hyperbolic for I a + d I > 2 : there are two fix-points on the
real axis; we can call them~ and TJ, and interpret the transformation as moving the hyperbolic plane away from~ and toward 71; if
~ is shifted into 0, and 11 into oo, the transformation becomes
z' = az/ d with ad = 1, i.e., a similarity of the whole upper halfplane; the points on the imaginary axis are moved upwards by the
hyperbolic distance 2a, where I a+ d I= 2 cosh( a).
For our construction of the periodic geodesic f3 to succeed, the matrix A which transforms a' into a, has to be hyperbolic. Indeed, if the
periodic geodesic f3 exists, then it can be transformed into the imaginary axis of U; the Euclidean circles corresponding to a and a' both
become circles around the origin; otherwise they don't intersect f3 as
well as the real axis at right angles. The hyperbolic distance a from a'
to a is given by 2 cosh (a) = trace A.
By the same arguments, the other 2 by 2 matrices, B, C, and D, are
also hyperbolic; and so are ABA- 1B- 1 and A- 1B- 1CD, which correspond to the thickness and the length of the pipe connecting the two
tori; see Figure 58. Quite generally, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence
between the homotopy group and the group of 2 by 2 matrices that is
generated by A, B, C, and D, subject to the condition (19.11). This
restriction means that the contour af3a' /3 1y8y' 81 can be contracted to
the base point P, as can be seen either from Figure 56 or from Figure
57.
The exact shape of the octagon F depends on the matrices A, B, ... ;
and conversely, the octogon with the identification of sides in Figure
56, as well as the sum 2'11 for the angles on the vertices, defines the
group G of matrices which is generated by A, B, ... . The octogon is,
therefore, called the fundamental domain of G. The hyperbolic plane
U is divided up into fundamental domains by G, an idea that leads to
the expression F ~ U I G .
The hyperbolic geometry of the double torus F, the combinatorial
properties of the homotopy group G as defined by the generators a, {3,
y, 8, and their inverses, and the subgroup of PSL(2,R) generated by the
corresponding matrices, and also called G for simplicity's sake, are
obviously different interpretations of the same underlying mathematical structure; but lest the reader thinks that all our questions can,
therefore, be answered, a look at the literature on the subject will tell
otherwise; cf. Magnus, Karass, and Solitar (1966), Beardon (1983),
Balazs and Voros (1986).

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

The effective enumeration of all the periodic geodesics remains an
elusive goal; all the words in the alphabet of a, /3, y, 8, and their inverses
can be written down, and any occurrences like a a- 1 or a- 1a can be
eliminated. The resulting group is called a free group on four generators; but the condition (19.11) is essential, and the resulting group on
four generators with one relation is different when long words in the
eight-letter alphabet are considered. The problem is further complicated by the requirement of finding the conjugacy classes; an algorithm
was found by Dehn (1911) and worked out by Greendlinger (1961),
to decide whether two words are equivalent, or even conjugate; but the
number of steps in the algorithm increases quickly with the length of
the word. We will discuss a very different method for finding a code
at the end of Section 20.2.

19.5 Selberg's Trace Formula
Schrodinger's equation in a Riemannian space can be derived from the
classical Hamiltonian by applying the usual procedures for going from
the classical dynamical variables to the corresponding linear operators.
The ordering of these qperators is determined by the rule that the
probability density 11/J I has to be conserved; also the expectation
value of the kinetic energy has to be positive definite, and its expression
in terms of the metric tensor has to remain the same in all coordinate
systems. Thus, one finds that

The potential energy V(q) will be a multiple of the Gaussian curvature K(q) in two dimensions. In higher dimensions, the curvature becomes a rather complicated tensor; but its trace Kover the components
is not trivial and can be used for V. The curvature term is included in
Schrodinger's equation, because Van Vleck's approximation then becomes exact in a three-dimensional space of constant curvature, provided V(q) = 1i 2K/2m. In two dimensions, Van Vleck's formula
becomes exact only in the limit of large distances
q' 1 2 > > 1/ K, provided V(q) = li 2 K/8m. When applied to the
I q" sphere, this extra term changes the eigenvalues from the usual
+ 1)1i 2 to the more intuitive (E + 1/2)2fi 2.
The stationary Schrodinger equation is, therefore, written as

" can be interpreted as the wave number with respect to the radius of
curvature
-1/ K ; occasionally, we will use the customary
A. = " 2 + 1I 4 for the eigenvalue of the Laplacian. When the coordinates in U are written as z = x + iy, the Laplacian becomes
~ =y2 (a2jax2 + a2;ay2). We will be interested in the spectrum of
the Laplacian for various domains; if it is a polygon that does not tile
U, then the boundary conditions have to be specified, e.g., the Dirichlet
condition cf> = 0.
If the polygon does tile U, however, we naturally choose periodic
boundary conditions, cJ>(z') = cJ>(z), where z' = T z, and Tis one of
the transformations ( 19.7) which define the polygon. Functions of this
type are called automorphic, without necessarily being eigenfunctions
of the Laplacian. Their automorphism refers to the specific tiling
polygon like F, or equivalently, to the corresponding homotopy group
G. Again, the reader has to be warned about overlapping nomenclature: a lot of mathematical results have been accumulated about
automorphic, analytic functions; they can be regarded as the kind of
functions we are looking for, but belonging to the eigenvalue 0 of the
Laplacian; obviously, there are not many of them for any fixed
polygon.
The essential steps in the derivation of the Selberg trace formula
(STF) will now be recounted, without any of the detailed mathematical
arguments, but with some hints concerning the purely algorithmic or
computational aspects. The purpose of this short exposition is to convey an idea of the reasoning behind the STF, and to show how it differs
from the justification of the trace formula in Section 17 .4. The details
can be found most completely in the first chapter of Hejhal's treatise
(1976a); the relations with the Riemann zeta-function are emphasized
by Hejhal (1976b). A somewhat abbreviated version was given by
McKean (1972) and Randol (1984); the book of Terras (1985) presents an appealing mixture of ideas and insights; Balazs and Voros
(1987) as well as Steiner (1987b) discuss the fine points in the derivation of the STF.
The first ingredient is a quite arbitrary function k(z 2 , z 1 ), which is
defined for any pair of points, z1 and z2 , in U; but which depends only
on their h~perbolic distance s, so that we can write it as
Q( lz2- Zt I IY2.Yd in view of (19.8). Such a function is used as a
kernel to define a linear operator M on the functions in U, and gives
us the first unexpected, although not difficult resul1t: If f(z) is any
function in U which satisfies (~ + A.)f = 0, thtm it is also an
eigenfunction of the operator M,

where the function A(K) depends only on the function Q, but not on
the eigenfunctions f(z); equivalently, the linear operator M and the
Laplacian commute.
The function A can now be computed explicitly in terms of Q by
inserting the particularly simple eigenfunction f(z) = y iK + 112 • If the

Since the hyperbolic distance along the imaginary axis is u = log(y),
the function f(z) = y iK + 112 represents a plane wave; its amplitude is
because of the distortion in the x-direction by the factor 1I yin the
metric. With a minor rearrangement, one can write,

Instead of functions which spread indifferently all over U, let us
now specialize f(z) to be an automorphic function for our octogon F.
Since f(z) repeats itself in every tile gF of U, where g is an element of
the homotopy group G, the integral (19 .14) can be divided into a sum
over all the group elements g E G, and an integral over each tile. The
linear operator M on the automorphic functions in F is now

Both points, z1 and z2 , belong to F, but z2 is spread over all of U by the
action of the group elements g e: G. The convergence of the sum over
G in the definition of the kernel K(z 1 , z2) requires that the function Q
in ( 19.15) go to zero sufficiently quickly for large hyperbolic distances.
The operator M can be expanded in its eigenfunctions <Pj(z); but
according to (19.14), they are also eigenfunctions of the Laplacian,
and since F is compact, the spectrum is discrete;

Now the trace is taken, yielding L A(K1) on the left-hand side, and that
is already one-half of Selberg's trace formula. On the right-hand side,
we go back to the definition ( 19.17) of K as a sum over all elements in
the group G.

19.5 Selberg's Trace Formula

361

This sum is now broken into conjugacy classes, exactly as it came
up in the discussion of the periodic geodesics in the preceding section;
but this break-up requires some care, and the reader has to be convinced that there is no double counting or leaving out of certain group
elements. The conjugacy class Cq of q E G has a primitive element
p € Cq, such that all the other elements of Cq can be written as
g- 1 pn g with positive integer n. Every element in Cq is generated exactly once when n runs through the positive integers, and g runs
through GIGp; these are the cosets in G with respect to the centralizer
Gp ; the latter is the subgroup of all the elements of G which commute
with p. The proof of these statements depends on all of the 2 by 2
matrices representing G being hyperbolic.
The integrand of any particular term in the trace on the right of
(19 .17) now becomes k(g- 1pngz , z) = k(pngz , gz), since k depends
only on the geodesic distance. The integration can then be made over
the tile gFwith the integrand k(pnz, z). The sum over these tiles, where
g € G I Gp, is a domain Fp that is determined by p alone; it can be
constructed quite easily as soon as p has been given the simple form
(p., 0; 0, 1/p.) by an appropriate choice of the coordinates. Fp is then
bounded by the horizontal lines aty = 1 andy= p.2 in U. The primitive
element p gives rise to a primitive periodic orbit of length
f(p) = 2log IL·
If we now go back to the function Q( Iz2- ztl 2IY2Yt) as in (19.13)
and (19.14), and set z2 =pnz = p. 2nz as well as z1 =z, the trace for

of P(u) is simply u = t(pn) = n f(p), where f is the length of the periodic geodesic belonging to g E G.
Before writing the final formula, however, we must treat the exceptional term in ( 19.19) that belongs to the conjugacy class of the unit
element in G. It requires the integration over F of k(z, z) = Q(O), according as (19.17) and (19.14); thus, we get simply 4'1T Q(O), since the
area of the octogon F is 4'1T. The function A(tc) on the left-hand side,
and the contributions from all the other conjugacy classes on the
right-hand side, are directly expressed in terms of the function P(u);
therefore, the definition of P(u) in terms of Q(v) according as (19.16)

362

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

is now inverted. This inversion is known as Abel's integral equation ( cf.
Courant-Hilbert vol. 1, a particularly simple treatment is given by
Hejhal 1976a, p.37), and requires no more than elementary manipulations.
As a last step, the exceptional term is expressed as a function of
A(K), because it will ultimately be shifted to the left-hand side, so that
the right-hand side depends only on the fluctuating part of the spectrum. Selberg's trace formula now becomes

f_:oc v A(v) tanh( 'TTV) dv
co

(19.20)

f(p)

+ ~ n~I 2 Sinh[n f(p)/2] P(n f(p))
The summation over the primitive conjugacy classes (pee) is, of course,
equivalent to the summation over the primitive periodic orbits (ppo).
Notice that A(K) and P(u) are Fourier transforms of each other; the
derivation of (19.20) can, therefore, be carried out for any pair of
functions A, P with good convergence properties, such as the example
given with (16.13).
In order to make contact with the more general, but only asymptotic
trace formula ( 17.13), we notice from the definition ( 19.16) that P( u)
is symmetric in u.
Therefore, we can set P(u) =
2
exp(i I u IV 2mE/Ii ), and give E a small positive imaginary part so
as to make the exponential vanish for large I u I. The Fourier integral
(19.16) is elementary, and yields A(Kj} = ili/2E/m /(E- Ej),
where we have set Ej = li 2 K}/2m. To recover (17.13), the expression
(19.4) for the action integral is used, and the primitive period To is
obtained as the primitive length f(p) divided by the the velocity
/2£/ m ; finally the instablility exponent x is equal to the length
n f(p) because of Jacobi's equation (19.6), and there are no conjugate
points for the same reason.
Sieber and Steiner (1990) have generalized the trace formula
( 17.13) for billiard systems, and probably homogeneous Hamiltonians
in general (cf. Section 17.8). An equation like (19.20) with an arbitrary pair of functions A(K) and P(u) is obtained, which leads to absolutely convergent series on both sides of ( 19.20). Although this version
of ( 17.13) is correct only in the limit of small li, it could be used for
numerical calculations similar to the ones in the next section.
Many authors have pointed out that Selberg's trace formula is a
generalization of the Poisson formula (16.13), because it equates two
summations, the first with the function A(K), and the second involving
its Fourier transform P(u). Whereas Poisson's formula is based on the

19.5 Selberg's Trace Formula

363

group of discrete translations in one dimension, the STF comes directly
out of the discrete group G whose fundamental domain is F. Such an
interpretation relies on the tiling of the hyperbolic plane, and does not
really account for the more general, but asymptotic trace formula
( 17.13). Conversely, if we apply ( 17.13) to an arbitrary polygon in the
hyperbolic plane, we get (19.20) with a ~ sign, and it is not clear why
there is an equality when the polygon tiles the plane. Nevertheless, the
STF gives a large class of examples where the general trace formula
( 17.13) can be greatly strengthened.

19.6 Computations on the Double Torus
Charles Schmit of the Nuclear Physics Institute in Orsay (France) was
the first to carry out large-scale computations in order to obtain the
spectrum of the Laplacian on a surface of constant negative curvature.
Unfortunately, his results have not been published systematically;
some of them are appended to the report by Balazs and Voros (1987),
and others are in a paper by Balazs, Schmit, and Voros (1987); but
further work that investigates the relation between the spectrum and
the periodic orbits remains in the realm of private communications.
This work is restricted to triangles in the hyperbolic plane with
Dirichlet boundary conditions; this limitation is both a matter of
choosing the most practical shape and of being able to apply a stable
computing algorithm. A discussion of Schmit's work must start with
explaining in more detail these two aspects.
Reflection symmetries were explicitly excluded from the construction of the tiling polygons in Section 19.3. Most members of the
six-parameter family of double tori do not have such symmetries, and
their spectra cannot be obtained by a method which relies on them.
Aurich, Sieber, and Steiner (1988) have worked out a scheme which,
at least in principle, is free of this restriction; most of the eigenvalues
for the regular octogon have to be computed by this method. Meanwhile, they have confirmed some of Schmit's results; their numerical
check of Selberg's trace formula will be discussed at the end of this
section.
Just as with the 14 Bravais lattices in three-dimensional Euclidean
space, the double tori in the hyperbolic plane and the paving they generate can be distinguished by the additional symmetries in the group G
of 2 by 2 matrices which is generated by A, B, etc. The largest number
of such symmetries is undoubtedly found in the tiling of the regular
octogon (cf. Figure 60); when placed at the center of the unit circle,

364

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

the symmetry lines divide the octagon into 96 congruent triangles. The
angles in one of them are 'TT/2, 'TT/3, and 'TT/8; their sum misses 'TT by
'TT /24 = 4'TT /96, and that is its surface according to the Gauss-Bonnet
theorem (19.10). By way of comparison, the most symmetric Bravais
lattice in the Euclidean plane is the square lattice; its reflection symmetries divide the square into only eight congruent triangles.
The spectrum for the regular octagon divides itself essentially into
96 subspectra, because the various reflection symmetries all commute
with the Laplacian. Each subspectrum is characterized by the way the
eigenfunction in one of the small triangles repeats itself in any of the
other 95. The most obvious of these transformations is a reflection at
the boundary with a change in sign of the eigenfunction. The
eigenfunction then vanishes at the boundary of the triangle, yielding
the Dirichlet condition. The corresponding eigenvalues are large even
for the lowest state, compared with the eigenfunctions with vanishing
derivatives, or other conditions, across the sides of the triangle.
The eigenfunctions are constructed for the triangle OEF in Figure
60 as follows: Schrodinger's equation is solved in Euclidean polar coordinates (p, cf>) around the center of the unit circle; the variables separate, and the angular dependence is the usual exp(i£cp) with integer f;
the radial function is a Legendre function with the indices (iK+ 1/2)
and e, where K can be any real number at this point; e, however, is
limited to multiples of 8 by the Dirichlet boundary condition along the
sides OF and OE. The eigenfunction then becomes

L Ct FK st(P) sin(8fcp) ,
co

1/JK(p, cf>) =

(19.21)

£= 1

where FK st(p) is the appropriate, real Legendre function.
The boundary condition on the side EFis now enforced: let a be the
hyperbolic length along EF, and call p(a) the polar coordinate of EF
as function a; it is then required that
foL da FK st(p(a)) sin(mra/ L)

= 0, for n = 1, ... , N ;(19.22)

the hyperbolic length of EF is called L. If the sum (19.21) is truncated
at e = N, a set of N linear conditions for the N coefficients Ct is obtained; its determinant is set to zero, and then yields a discrete set of
values for "· The integral condition turns out to be crucial for the stability of the computation. Although the general idea of this calculation
is easy to explain, its execution is a delicate task.
The resulting 369 eigenvalues A. are listed by Balazs and Voros
(1986); they fit Weyl's asymptotic distribution very well, but it is necessary to include the boundary and curvature terms as in (16.3). There

inner angles 'TT/2, 'TT/3, and 'TT/8; Schmit calculated the spectrum of the
Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions for this triangle.

are a few near-degeneracies, however, which would be very unlikely in
a sample of this size, if the GOE were applicable. The reasons are not
clear at this time; but the regular octagon where this particular triangle
originates has very high symmetry contrary to most of the other tiling
octagons. The generic octagons conform to the GOE statistics according to the recent calculations of Aurich and Steiner (1990). Also,
Schmit has calculated the eigenvalues of the Laplacian with Dirichlet
boundary conditions for the hyperbolic triangle with the inner angles
'IT/8, 'IT/2, and 67'1T/200. Although it differs minimally from the previous triangle, but does not tile the hyperbolic plane, it has a spectrum
with very good GOE statistics, and no near degeneracies.
The fluctuations in the spectrum for the triangle OEF were investigated by Balazs, Schmit, and Voros (1987) with the help of a larger
sample of 1500 eigenvalues. The zeta-function ( 17 .2:9) is examined in
the complex z-plane; its values for Re(z) > 1 can be calculated from
the known sample, because the series is convergent; the authors ask
whether the function can be continued analytically to the left of the line
Re(z)= 1. The known poles are directly related to Weyl's asymptotic
distribution; convergence for Re(z) < 1 requires each term in (17 .29)

366

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

to be compensated on the basis of Weyl's formula. The fluctuations
become ever more drastic as z moves down the real axis, and the
method fails below z = 0. This way of looking at the spectrum merits
further attention.
This work has an interesting antecedent which is significant for the
later discussion in this section. The formula ( 17 .25) for the logarithmic
derivative of the Riemann zeta-function t(z) has a summation over all
prime numbers on the left, which converges for Re(z) > 1. This sum
can be continued analytically into Re(z) < 1 with the help of the Prime
Number Theorem ( cf. Section 16.1); but this procedure comes to a halt
at the poles on the right-hand side of (17.25) which are located at the
famous zeros of t(z). The convergence in the sum over the primes
should, therefore, be particularly poor when z gets close to one of these
zeros. The sum on the left of (17.25) can be truncated by p < P, and
its value calculated as a function of a; the compensation with the help
of the Prime Number Theorem yields indeed finite values except near
the zeros. Thus, in spite of the mathematical wisdom at the end of
Section 17.9, they can be located rather easily with a few figures accuracy, even while truncating at P = 100; Berry (1985) and the author
independently found that this calculation works like a charm. It is, of
course, directly related to the remarks at the end of the preceding
chapter.
Aurich and Steiner ( 1989) have recently developed a method for
finding the spectrum on a double torus without Dirichlet boundary
conditions along the symmetry lines. They have used the 200 lowest
energy levels to make a numerical check on Selberg's trace formula.
Such a task requires that the periodic orbits be enumerated and calculated; the mathematicians have worked on this problem for some time,
and have established, in the special case of constant negative curvature,
a number a theorems for what they call the length spectrum of a
Riemannian surface. In particular, Huber (1959) showed that the

the
confirms
the limit of large e; this estimate
and the metric entropy which was discussed in Section 10.5; indeed,
the Lyapounoff number is 1 on a surface of constant negative curvature, as shown by (19.6).
Again, Aurich and Steiner ( 1988) have calculated the length spectrum for the octagon F to some upper limit. The author had done the
same thing in 1979; but he only discussed the results with a few colleagues; his failure to publish anything had the following reason. The
analogy with Riemann's zeta-function has just been recalled; the length
spectrum is given by the logarithm of the prime numbers, and the
eigenvalues are the zeros of t(z); even a short list of prime numbers

yields remarkably good values for the zeros. Our main goal, to get the
quantum-mechani cal energy spectrum from the classical length spectrum, as we did in the AKP, seemed to be within easy reach.
But Weyl's formula (16.2) shows that the mean spacing of the
eigenvalues A. = K 2 + 1I 4 on the double torus is 1 because the area
A = 4'1T. If we want to resolve the N-th excited level against the
(N + 1)-st with the help of the STF (19.20), we have
!1A. = 2 "dK!::::: 1, or dK!::::: 1/2(N + 1/2) 112. For a resolution of dK in
the Fourier transform (19.16), however, the integral over u has to be
extended to 2'1T I dK, as evidenced by the example given together with
Poisson's formula (16.13). In the context of (19.20), the sum over the
periodic orbits has to be extended to f(p) ~ 4'1T(N + 112) 112. There
are ~ exp(f) I periodic orbits of length ~ so that the sum over the
periodic orbits requires ~ exp(4'1T(N + 1/2) 112)/ 4'1T(N + 112)1/2
terms to yield even the N lowest excited states; thus, the computation
seemed impossible.
In order to get the length spectrum for the double torus, the
conjugacy classes of the homotopy group G have to be enumerated,
and the lengths of the periodic geodesics are then obtained from the
trace of the corresponding 2 by 2 matrices. The enumeration can be
done as mentioned at the end of Section 3; first, all the words in the
alphabet are written down systematically, and all adjacent pairs of letters like a- 1a are eliminated right away; then follows the difficult

e

e,

368

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

process of checking whether any words can be simplified because of
the relation (19.11), and whether they can be shortened by conjugation. For words up to length 11, the work is not prohibitive; but the
proliferation of periodic orbits is terrifying; also, some rather long
primitive words can yield short lengths, so that a complete list of all
geodesics up to a certain length is hard to get.
Aurich and Steiner generated a sample of 5 • 106 periodic orbits;
such a number would not even let us clearly isolate the second excited
state (N = 2) according as the above estimate of the expected resolution. A peculiar symmetry argument seems to come to our help,
however; the computation simplifies in the special regular octogon that
the authors used: the identification of different sides in the octogon of
Figure 60 is not made according as Figure 56, but by identifying opposite sides. The resulting compact double torus has a large group of
discrete symmetries so that many different periodic orbits have the
same length. According to Aurich and Steiner (1988), the traces of the
corresponding 2 by 2 matrices have the value m + n/2 , where n
runs through all th~ositive integers, and m is the positive odd integer
that minimizes Iy2 - m/n I; this remarkable result is complicated
by the degeneracies which Bogomolnyi and Steiner (1990) are now
able to calculate.
The pair A(K), P(u) in formula (19.20) is first chosen to be
(19.23)
e- (K- IC)2/e2 + e- (K + /Cl2/,2 ' (e/F) cos(l(u) e- ,2u2/4'
where I( is a parameter that varies from 0 to oo. As a function of K, the
left-hand side (lhs) of STF becomes a series of peaks, located near KJ,
e. The right-hand side (rhs)
and of root-mean-square width !1"K =

10,000 primitive ones; Figure 61 shows both sides of the STF as a
function of A near the origin. The agreement is very impressive, and
seems to contradict our pessimistic estimate, at least for the highly
symmetric octogon.
A similar result with the two sides of STF playing the reverse role,
is obtained with the pair

the function P(u) is the heat diffusion in one dimension, from the
sources at u = L and at u = - L, over the time t. For sufficiently short
times these sources at the locations nf (p) are separated because of the
Gaussian nature of the heat kernel. The lhs yields these locations,
provided the summation is carried over a sufficiently large set of energy

19.7 Surfaces in Contact with the Outside World
A polygon was defined at the beginning of Section 19.3 as a simply
connected domain of finite area, which is bounded by straight lines.
The restriction to a finite area is artificial in Euclidean geometry, and
may just as well be replaced right away by the stronger assumption of
In hyperbolic geometry, howevf~r, non-compact
compactness.
polygons of finite area are easy to construct; they can also be regarded
as mathematical models for many physical situations where a particle
or a wave enters a container from the outside, coming from infinitely
far away as in a scattering problem.
Non-compact polygons of finite area, also called singular polygons,
have vertices that are infinitely far away, as measured in the hyperbolic
metric. In Poincare's upper half-plane U, such a vertex is located on
the real line; the two adjacent sides of the polygon are Euclidean circles

370

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

that are centered on the real axis and meet there; both of them intersect
the real axis at a right angle, and touch each other; the angle between
them is 0, the external angle of the polygon at that vertex is '". When
their meeting point is moved to the point at oo, they become two
Euclidean straight lines that are parallel to the imaginary axis. If they
are at a Euclidean distance a from each other, the hyperbolic area between them is a f dy I y 2 , which converges as the upper limit goes to oo.
The best known polygon of this kind is the modular domain D 1 ,
which is defined by the inequalities, -1/2 :5 x :5 +1/2 and
x2 + y 2 ~ 1 in U. It is a tri~le with the angles 0 at oo, and'" /3 at each
of the points ( ± 1 + i vf3 )/2; its area is 'TT/3 according to the
Gauss-Bonnet formula (19.10). The hyperbolic plane can be tiled by
D 1 with the help of the translation, z .... z' = z + 1, and the rotation by
180° around the point i, z .... z' = -1/z. These two operations, T =
[1,1; 0,1] and S = [0,- 1; 1,0], generate the modular group whose
elements are the 2 by 2 matrices [ a , b ; c , d ] with integer entries
a, b, c, d and ad - be = 1. The pieces numbered 2 and 3 in Figure 65
make up the modular domain.
The modular domain D 1 becomes a Riemannian surface, if the
points on its boundary are identified pairwise with the help of T and
S. There are two singularities on this surface besides the point at oo;
the neighborhood of the point i looks like a cone with a 60° opening,
and the neighborhood of the ,Q_oint (1 + i !3)/2 looks like a cone
with an opening of arcsin(4vf2 /9). Topologically, this surface is a
sphere; it has played a major role in number theory and in complex
variable theory; but as model for some simple physical system, it does
not appear to be very useful, because the second conical point has no
good physical interpretation. With a little imagination, the first conical
point can be understood as a localized electric charge, because a
geodesic near it makes a sharp U-turn, exactly as the scattering in a
Coulomb potential.
Three adjacent copies of D 1 can be put together so as to form a
singular triangle, i.e., a hyperbolic triangle whose vertices are all infinitely far away. The three vertices can always be brought into the
points x = 0, 1, oo on the real axis; this region D 2 has as its sides the two
vertical Euclidean lines x = 0 and x = 1, and the Euclidean circle
(x- 1/2) 2 + y 2 = 1/4; it is the gray region in Figure 65, above the
interval (0,1) on the real axis. The relation between D 1 and D 2 can be
seen in Figure 65. The group belonging to D 2 is obtained from the
modular ,.group by dividing out the threefold rotation around the point
(1 + i vf3 )/2, i.e., the elements TS and (TS) 2 .
The singular triangle paves the hyperbolic plane just as the modular
domain does; its group tells us how to continue a geodesic inside D 2 .

19.7 Surfaces in Contact with the Outside World

371

Clearly, the two vertical sides are mapped into each other by a translation parallel to the x-axis, while the bounding circle is mapped into
itself by a rotation of 1800 around (1 + i)/2, i.e., TST2S. The resulting
surface is topologically again a sphere; it has a point at oo, and a conical
point with a 60° opening angle. With some poetic Jicense, this geometry can be interpreted as relating to the motion of a particle that comes
from far away to settle on a two-dimensional sphere, with an attractive
Coulomb potential centered in a point opposite to the entry-exit.
The singular triangle D 2 can be doubled, to yield a singular square;
the corresponding group is obtained by dividing out the 180° rotation,
thereby getting rid of the last conical point. The new fundamental domain D3 is bounded by the two vertical Euclidean lines x = ± 1, and
the two circles (x ± 1/2) 2 + y 2 = 1/4, as shown in Figure 63. Opposite sides are identified as in the ordinary torus, with the help of the
maps A = [1,1;1, 2] and B = [1,- 1;- 1, 2]. The group which is
generated by A, B, and their inverses, can be characterized by the
arithmetical properties of the integers (a, b; c, d), though they are not
all that simple to state; it is also known as the commutator subgroup
of the modular group, which is again not very helpful. The reader will
find many fascinating details about this group in the work of Harvey
Cohen (1972).
The singular square D 3 has a rather convincing physical interpretation and can even be compared directly to a simple surface in threedimensional Euclidean space. Start with the square - s ~ x, y ~ + s
with s;:::l, where points on opposite sides are identified by translation;
then, cut the circular disk of radius 1 from the center of the square.
Into the gaping hole, attach a horn with the shape of a trombone, as
shown in Figure 64; it is centered on the positive z-axis, and its crosssection in the (x, z) plane is the so-called tractrix. Its equation in terms
of a parameter p ~ 0 is
x = 1/cosh p , z = p- tanhp .
(19.25)
This surface was called the pseudosphere by Liouville; it has the
Gaussian curvature K = - 1 as shown in the marvelous Introduction to
Geometry by Coxeter ( 1961).
The tangent to the curve (19.25) atz = 0 is horizontal; but its curvature is oo. Thus, the connection with the punched torus whose
Gaussian curvature is 0, of course, is not smooth; nevertheless , one
can imagine a particle or a wave swooping down the horn, and then
spreading inside the torus as inside a closed box in a highly chaotic
manner. This picture of something coming in from the outside, and
then bouncing around inside a container, becomes more obvious if the
domain D3 is rearranged in the hyperbolic plane, as shown in Figure

65; it looks like six copies of the modular domain set down next to one
another; the six circular arcs are identified in pairs by the maps A, B,
and C = (AB)- 1, while the two outside vertical lines are mapped into
each other by the translation R along the x-axis over six Euclidean
units.
The construction of the singular square can be generalized to a singular quadrangle D 4 • A closer look at Figure 63 shows that no more is
required than the existence of two hyperbolic transformations A and
B whose commutator is a parabolic transformation R,
(19.26)
ABA- 1 B- 1 = R .
As in the case of the double torus and the relation (19 .11), we can
count the essential parameters left to choose: R is parabolic iff
trace(R) = 2, so that (19.26) represents one algebraic condition on A
and B; moreover, an overall coordinate transformation Tallows for
three inessential parameters; e.g., three of the four vertices are still located in the points 0, 1, and oo as in Figure 63, while the location of the
fourth is somewhere on the negative x-axis, not necessarily in - 1.
Figure 65 gets modified into Figure 66; the six circular arcs are equal
only in pairs as indicated by the transformations A, Band C.
The two essential parameters determine different singular
quadrangles which cannot be mapped into one another isometrically.
Since our Riemannian surface is topologically a torus, we end up with
the same number of parameters for different hyperbolic tori, in addition to the scale factor K = Gaussian curvature, as in the Euclidean
plane; there, the shape of the torus is determined by the ratio of its two

sides, a and {3, taken to be complex numbers. Equivalently, we could
replace the punched square with the attached horn by a punched
parallelogram; the analogy breaks down, however, because the absolute size of the parallelogram now enters into the picture.
There is one essential parameter left, even after requiring the fourth
vertex to be located in x = - 1, so that D4 still looks exactly as Figure
63. In terms of e > 0, we have A= [ e, e; e, (1 + e2 )/e] and
B = [ e,- e; - e, (1 + e 2 )/e ]; when e changes, the fit between opposite sides in D 4 gets modified; they slide internally with respect to
each other, while keeping the endpoints on the real axis fixed.
Other singular polygons which tile the hyperbolic plane, and represent non-compact, complete Riemannian spaces of finite area, can be
constructed in this manner. Their homotopy group is represented in
terms of 2 by 2 real matrices. Instead of, or in addition to, relations like
(19.11), each point at oo contributes a relation like (19.26) where the
right-hand side is only required to be parabolic. As an exercise, the
reader may try to write down the relations for a torus with two points
at oo, and count the number of independent parameters. Such a surface
is a model for a metal ring with two leads attached, to allow a current
to enter in one lead, and to exit in the other lead; a magnetic flux can
traverse the ring, without generating a magnetic field in the space itself;
the current in function of the magnetic flux shows the Aharonov-Bohm
effect (cf. Gutzwiller 1986).

19.8 Scattering on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature
The singular square allows us to give a complete solution for a problem
in the scattering of waves where the behavior of the classical trajectories is known to be chaotic. The situation is most easily understood
with the help of Figure 65: the solution y 112 - iK of Schrodinger's
equation (19.13) represents an incoming wave which comes swooping
down along the imaginary axis; as we argued in (19.15), its waveis necessary to give a flux indevector is K, and the amplitude
pendent of y in the metric (19.8). The scattering process will be
explained in a language which implies a well-defined sequence of
events; but as in the discussion of Section 17 .5, we look at solutions
of the wave equation for a constant frequency, and the scattered waves
are present at all times. Only the more complicated ones have a smaller
amplitudes (for more details, see Gutzwiller 1983).
The incoming wave has to be continued upon reaching the lower
boundary, i.e., the six circular arcs in Figure 65. The procedure is
simple: what goes out in one arc, comes back in through the corresponding arc with the help of the transformations A, B, etc.; the incoming wave becomes

When any element g = [ a , b ; c , d ] is multiplied on the left by the
translation R = [1, r; 0,1] of (19.26), one finds Rg =
[a+ rc, b + rd; c, d] so that the scattered wave (19.27) remains the
same; therefore, it is enough to have only one representative for each
left coset with respect to the translations in the summation (19.28).
When we multiply with a translation on the right to get the right cosets,
we find gR = [a, b + ra ; c, d + rc ]; in the case of the singular
square, c and dare integers, and relatively prime because ad - be = 1,
while r is a multiple of 6. It is not trivial to show that every pair of integers with the greatest common divisor (c, d) = 1, and c 2!: 1, occurs
exactly once in the summation (19.28).

376

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

The complete wave function (19.28) can now be calculated; it can
be decomposed into Fourier components with respect to its dependence on x; but if we move very far along the imaginary axis, all the
Fourier components vanish exponentially except the term independent
of x; it is the only one to give an outgoing wave. Its amplitude and
phase can be obtained if (19.28) is integrated over x for the full width
r = 6 of Figure 65. The right cosets with respect to the translation are
correctly included, if that integration over x is extended from - oo to
+oo, and we are left with the condition (c, d) = 1 with 1 :5 d < c.
The integral over- oo < x < +oo of any one term in (19.27) can be
expressed in terms of gamma-functions, so that Jdx 1/J becomes

where the last summation is limited to 1 :5 d < c. The second term
represents exactly the outgoing wave, and the double sum gives the
amplitude and phase as a function of K.
The second sum in (19 .29) is equal to the number of integers, traditionally designated by cp(c), between 0 and c, which are prime relative
to c. The reader will find the explicit formula for cp(c) in any elementary textbook on number theory; it involves the decomposition of c into
primes. The first summation in (19.29) becomes, therefore, expressed
as a sum over all combinations of prime numbers, and it is not difficult
to see that one ends up eventually with the Euler product (17.26) for
the Riemann zeta-function.
With some minor manipulations, one finds that

where Z(z) = rr-=1 2 f(z/2) f(z). This function of the complex variable z is real on the real axis; the numerator and the denominator are
complex conjugates. The factor of y 112 + iK in (19.29) can, therefore,
be written as exp(2i/3(K)) where {3(K) is a real number dependent on "•
called the phase shift of the outgoing wave with respect to the incoming
wave. (The peculiar combination Z(z)= rr-=1 2 f(z/2) t(z) was shown
by Riemann to be symmetric with respect to the critical line Re(z) =
1/2, i.e., Z(z) = Z(l - z); therefore, Z(l/2 + 2iK) is real-valued for
real values of K; and the famous zeros of the Riemann zeta-function
are the zeros of this 'ordinary' function, which can be plotted like any
other.)
A more detailed, and mathematically complete derivation can be
found in the monographs of Kubota (1973), and of Lax and Phillips
(1976). While the formula (19.30) was obviously known to the

19.8 Scattering on a Surface of Negative Curvature

377

mathematicians for some time, they did not realize its importance for
the understanding of chaotic features in wave mechanics; the author
(Gutzwiller 1983) was the first to study the scattering in the singular
square from this viewpoint.

19.9 Chaos in Quantum-Mechanical Scattering
Before comparing this quantum-mechanical result to its classical analog, the phase-shift {3(K) will be examined more closely. The function
Z(z) is to be evaluated on the line Re(z) = 1; Riemann's zeta-function
f(z) does not vanish on this parallel to the critical line Re(z) = 1/2; this
fact is the essential step in the proof of the Prime Number Theorem (cf.
Section 16.1 ). On the other hand, {3(K) is basically the logarithm of the
f(z), so that the zeros of f(z) on the critical line become singularities
in the phase shift, and make themselves felt. The random nature of the
zeros (cf. Section 17.9) is found again in the phase shift {3(K), although
smoothened by the distance of 1/2, which guarantees a Taylor expansion in K - I( near any point K, with a convergence radius of 1/4 at
least.
A plot of the phase shift as a function of K bears out this impression;
since the factors .,-z/ 2 and f(z/2) in Z(z) make only additive,
monotonically increasing contributions to {3(K), we have plotted in
Figure 67 only the phase angle of f(l + 2iK) for large values of K. Although the Riemann zeta-function is an analytic function with the
deceptively simple definition (17.26), it keeps bouncing around almost
randomly without settling down to some regular asymptotic pattern.
The Riemann zeta-function displays the essence of chaos in quantum mechanics, analytically smooth, and yet seemingly unpredictable.
This chaotic feature has been demonstrated more dramatically by
Reich (1980) and Good (1981), in the form of the following amazing
theorem:
Let D be a disk of radius r > 0 in the complex plane, centered
on one of the points f.L + i m v, where 1/2 < f.L < 1 and v > 0
are fixed, while the integers m > 0; the size r of these disks is
limited by the condition that they have to be inside the strip
1/2 < z < 1; then choose an arbitrary non-vanishing,
holomorphic function f(z), whose Taylor expansion around 0
converges inside a circle of radius r. Now consider the set M

non-vanishing density, i.e., the number of points in M below
some large N > 0 is a non-vanishing fraction of N with a lower
bound greater than 0; this fraction depends, of course, on the
functionf(z) and on e.
In a more intuitive language, the Riemann zeta-function is capable of
fitting any arbitrary smooth function over a finite disk with arbitrary
accuracy, and it does so with comparative ease, since it repeats the
performance like a good actor infinitely many times on a designated set
of stages.
Instead of a wave entering the singular square with a fixed wave
vector K, one can construct a wave packet from the superposition of
such waves, with a spread of LlK around /C. The width of the wave

19.9 Chaos in Quantum-Mechanical Scattering

379

packet in position space is !lu ~ 2'1T I IlK, and the average speed
v = Iii" /m as usual, where m is again the mass of the particle. The
wave packet gets distorted, of course, when it wanders around the singular square; but if the spread IlK is small enough, the outgoing wave
packet has an average position u = Vi- o(K"), with a backward shift
in position o given by d{3/ dK. Thus, the derivative of the phase shift
with respect to the wave vector can be interpreted as a delay in the
outgoing wave.
Wardlaw and Jaworski (1989) have calculated this delay as a function of K ; since it is the derivative of {3(K), the random nature of this
function is even more pronounced. This interpretation is very appealing; but its validity in our case is severely limited. In order to see the
strong variations of {3(K), the spread IlK has to be quite small; but then
the spread in position space is correspondingly large, and the center of
the wave packet may not be defined precisely enough to detect the
delay d{3/dK. The wave packet has to be calculated more carefully by
carrying out the full integration over K, rather than simply finding its
center; it is then necessary to take the full complication of the Riemann
zeta-function into account.

19.10 The Classical Interpretation of the Quantal Scattering
The scattering on the singular square has been worked out in detail
because the final result can be written down explicitly, and its surprising properties can be seen very clearly. Whether they are typical of
scattering in systems with hard chaos cannot be demonstrated at this
time, although the author is convinced of this fact. It is, therefore,
important to show that the critical formula (19.29) has a simple interpretation that goes directly back to classical mechanics. Indeed, the
basic idea can be readily expressed for scattering problems in a more
physical context, such as an electron scattered from a molecule, assumed to be rigid for the discussion's sake (cf. Section 20.1).
The wave function (19.28) is valid for any singular quadrangle,
provided we understand correctly which terms are left out of the summation; instead of the highly symmetric domain D3 in Figure 65, we
now deal with the more general domain D 4 in Figure 66. The translation R in the definition of the cosets is given by the rhs of (19.26);
if it is transformed to the standard form [1, r; 0,1], the explanations
following (19.28) are still applicable. Only one representative for a left
coset with respect to R is used, and the integration over x in (19.29)
can be carried out the same way, provided we take again only one

380

representative in each right coset with respect toR. Thus, we can write

where the unit element in G is left out of the summation.
The only quantity left over from the 2 by 2 matrix [ a , b ; c , d ] is
the lower left-hand entry c, which is the same for all the group elements
in the double coset; we now give a geometrical meaning to c. The
reader may find it helpful to go back to the original picture (Figure 64)
of an exponential horn which is attached to a torus; let us fix a ring
around the horn at some distance y from the torus. In the upper halfplane, this ring becomes a line parallel to the x-axis at the arbitrary, but
fixed distance y. Let us now take a string both of whose end-points are
attached to this line y = constant, and which follows the path corresponding to the group element.
To be more precise, we choose two points in the upper half-plane,
z = x +iy and z' = x' +ry; then we calculate z" = (az' +b)/(cz' +d),
and the hyperbolic distances between z and z" according to (19.8).
The coordinates x and x' are allowed to vary freely while y stays constant; intuitively, the string is allowed to wind around the exponential
horn at both ends, although its path around the torus has to remain
topologically the same; in this manner, we take advantage of the double
coset with respect to the translation R.
The length s is now minimized with respect to x and x'. The computation is elementary, although the reader has to proceed with some
caution so as not to get bogged down in an algebraic morass. The
minimum length is found to be s = 2 log( I c !Y); we can, therefore, express the outgoing wavey 112 + iKjc 1 - 2iK as the incoming wavey 112 - iK
times the scattering amplitude exp(i "s)/c; the common factor
f(l/2)f( -iK)/f(l/2- iK) of all outgoing waves is not relevant here.
Formula (19. 31) is simply the sum over all possible shortest paths
from a ring or monitoring station around the exponential horn at the
distance log y and back. The contribution of each path has a phase
equal to the wave vector times the length of the path. The amplitude
exp(- loge) is the stability factor for a path of length loge, which is the
length of the path inside the torus, rather than along the exponential
horn. Thus, the expression (19.31) is the analog of the trace formula
for positive energies; indeed, the reader will find in the second volume
of Hejhal's treatise ( 1983) a complete discussion of the Selberg trace
formula for a non-compact surface of negative curvature; the first term
on the right-hand side is exactly (19.31).

19.10 Classical Interpretation of Quantal Scattering

381

The phase shift for the scattering from a singular quadrangle has not
been evaluated, except for the few special cases that are commensurable
with the modular group; such a group has a subgroup of finite index
which is isomorphic to a subgroup of the modular group. Then, the rhs
of (19.31) differs from (19.30) by a simple analytic function whose
phase is periodic in "• and does not change any of the statements at the
end of the last section; cf. Gutzwiller (1987). The main problem in the
general case is to generate the group elements in some effective way,
other than writing down all the elements of a free group in the generators A and B, and using the relation (19.26) whenever possible. This
issue will be discussed in the next chapter.
The classical interpretation of the quantal scattering as demonstarted in (19.31) shows that classical mechanics, if used properly, is
able to yield a correct quantum-mechanical result. Such a conclusion
may not be surprising on a surface of constant negative curvature, since
Selberg's trace formula has already accomplished a similar feat for the
spectrum on a compact surface of this kind. Actually, formula (19.31)
is only the first term in a generalization of STF for non-compact surfaces (cf. Hejhal1983); the singular square of Figure 63 has a discrete
spectrum in addition to the scattering wave functions (19.29) and
(19.31). These bound states decay exponentially toward the exceptional point at oo; their difficult and treacherous computation was first
attacked systematically by Winkler (1988) and Hejhal (1989).
The remarkable feature of (19.31) is that the classical scattering
trajectories form a set of measure 0 in phase space; most trajectories
neither come in from oo nor escape to oo; there is no classical scattering
in this sense. Nevertheless these same exceptional trajectories give a
perfect account of the quantum mechanics!
The scarcity of trajectories that come in never to leave again, or that
leave sometimes in the future after a whole lifetime in the box, is well
known in celestial mechanics. It has been shown only quite recently,
that two bodies bound in a Kepler ellipse can capture a third one, or the
inverse process, the ejection of one of the bodies from a bound threebody system; such trajectories form a set of measure 0 in phase space
(cf. Alekseev 1969 and Moser 1973).
The scattering problem of the last three sections was intentionally
constructed to imitate the experimental situation where a probe is sent
into a 'black box' along one degree of freedom to find out what is inside. Since the scattering is elastic, the only information to be obtained
is the scattering phase shift f3 as a function of the wave vector k.
Schrodinger's equation tells us how to compute the phase shift if the
scattering potential Vis known; but Vis not well understood in nuclear
and particle physics, so the problem has to be inverted: Can we deter-

382

Motion on a Surface of Constant Negative Curvature

mine the scattering potential once the phase shift as a function of the
wave vector is known?
This problem was first discussed by Bargmann (1949), and became
very important in the discussion of solitons during the 1960s; then Jost
and Kohn (1952 and 1953) proposed several methods for constructing
V from {3(k); Dyson (1976) wrote an interesting review. This work
was done in the context of elastic scattering from a compact,
spherically symmetric object in three dimensions; angular momentum
is conserved in addition to the energy, and there is a phase shift for
each value L = ff'i. The most important case is e = 0, which can be
reduced to the scattering in one dimension, say the positive x-axis,
provided the wave function is required to vanish at the origin; one of
the difficulties arises from the existence of bound states.
It is natural to ask whether the phase shift (19.30) could be due to
some one-dimensional potential V(x), similar to the ones constructed
by Jost and Kohn. Although I have not examined which conditions are
violated by (19.30) so as to prevent the construction of V(x), I don't
think that any reasonable function V(x) can yield a complicated result
like (19.30). Nor is it likely that a three-dimensional, spherically
symmetric potential could do it. On the other hand, if the requirement
of spherical symmetry is dropped, we will show at the beginning of the
next chapter that chaotic behavior is to be expected classically. In view
of the classical interpretation of the quantum calculation, one can expect results that are qualitatively similar to (19.30) quite generally.
They open up a completely new vista on scattering theory.

CHAPTER 20

Scattering Problems, Coding,
Multifractallnvariant Measures

and

The two topics of this last chapter have only recently entered into the
discussion of chaotic Hamiltonian systems; in both cases the author
(Gutzwiller 1983; Gutzwiller and Mandelbrot 1988) was the first, with
a safe headstart, to consider the problems involved, and to demonstrate
the basic features by working out a typical example in some mathematical detail. Scattering in a surface of constant negative curvature
was discussed at the end of the last chapter; but quite generally, the
phase shift can be expected to depend in an analytically smooth, and
yet essentially chaotic manner on the wave vector. Moreover, this behavior is the result of a straightforward approximation based on classical mechanics, even though the purely classical interpretation of
scattering by itself may not yield reasonable, let alone good results.
Finding a useful code for all the classical trajectories seems to be the
most important tool for making any progress. The Anisotropic Kepler
Problem (AKP in Chapter 11 and the last three sections of Chapter
17) was presented in great detail, because it is coded by binary sequences, and appears, therefore, to be the simplest case of hard chaos.
Codes for scattering seem easier to construct than for bound states;
we will give some general examples.
A good code tells the full and unique story of a particular classical
trajectory in a Hamiltonian system with hard chaos; but its primary
information is totally different from the usual coordinates in phase
space, or, more specifically, in the surface of section. The physics is

contained in the relation between these two equally important descriptions. Both of them define useful measures in the space of all
trajectories, and both are invariant as one goes from one surface of
section to the next. In order to express one in terms of the other, it is
necessary to invoke the concept of multifractal sets, which was first
proposed by Mandelbrot (1982).
As we approach the regime of soft chaos, however, the code either
becomes more complicated, or it ceases to characterize a trajectory
uniquely. We will display this phenomenon in the context of the AKP,
when the mass ratio falls below 2, or when the angular momentum
around the longitudinal axis is allowed to differ from zero. Whereas a
'slippery devil's staircase,' a strictly increasing function, is found to
characterize hard chaos, the usual 'devil's staircase', an increasing
function with both horizontal and vertical pieces is typical of soft
chaos.

20.1 Electron Scattering in a Muffin-Tin Potential
Scattering problems in quantum mechanics have a long and important
history, starting with Rutherford scattering where classical mechanics
gives a correct quantum result (cf. Section 12.4). Miller (197 4) was
perhaps the first to apply systematically the classical information, in
order to extract quantum results in the theory of molecular scattering;

20.1 Electron Scattering in a Muffin-Tin Potential

385

this effort has continued ever since, with many practical applications
in chemical physics. We will not try to follow up on any of this work,
but concentrate on some simple, somewhat abstract examples where
the basic chaotic features can be easily recognized.
The close relation between classical and quantum mechanics in the
scattering process can be illustrated by a simple physical example ( cf.
Gutzwiller 1985a). Consider a molecule consisting of a finite number
of atoms, called A, B, C, ... etc., which are centered in fixed positions
with the same names, and let them be two-dimensional for simplicity's
sake, as shown in Figure 68. Each atom generates a screened, attractive Coulomb potential, such as VA(rA) = - (e 2/rA) ~A(rA), where the
function ~A decreases monotonically from some positive integer ZA, as
the distance 'A from the nucleus in A increases; this potential is confined to the inside of a circle of radius RA. Between these nonoverlapping circles, the potential is assumed to be :5 0 out to some large
circle which surrounds the whole molecule, whereas the potential beyond is zero. This model is inspired by certain band calculations in
solid-state physics, and we give it the corresponding name, the twodimensional muffin-tin molecule. A muffin-tin in American folklore is
a flat sheet of metal with a regular array of circular depressions; these
get filled with dough, and the whole thing is heated in an oven to be
baked; the dough in the depression rises, and out eome the muffins,
which are particularly appreciated at breakfast time.
Let us call this muffin-tin potential V(x ,y), and let us investigate
an electron of energy E > 0, which comes from very far away along
some direction 1, is scattered by the molecule, and leaves along some
direction 2. Classically, we can just as well fix two end-points,
(xt , Yt) and (x2 , )'2), very far from the molecule, and lying along the
directions 1 and 2. The classical trajectories are obtained from finding
the stationary values of the Euler-Maupertuis action-integral (2.6),

!

(20.1)

exactly as in Section 2.3. The corresponding Green's function follows
immediately from the Van Vleck-type expression (12.28), in terms of
the stationary values of (20.1).
The novel feature in this argument is the combination of E > 0 with
the special shapes of V(x ,y) < 0 inside each one of the molecular circles. The Euclidean distance dx 2 + dy 2 is stretched by the constant
factor J2mE outside the molecule, whereas inside any of the circles
the stretching is done by the larger factor /2m[E - V(x, y)] . This
additional stretch is comparable to creating a hill inside each of the atoms, such that the length of the slope is in the ratio of

V

Figure 69 For positive energies, the classical trajectories in the muffin-tin
potential are the geodesics on a two-dimensional Riemannian surface which
can be embedded somewhat schematically in three-dimensional Euclidean
space. A string is layed down loosely at first to follow a prescribed sequence
of turns around the various atoms, and the corresponding trajectory is then
obtained by tightening the string.

(x ,y) plane. The Gaussian curvature of this hill is negative for the
screened Coulomb potentials, and there is a conical tip of opening 60°
at the center of each atom.
A classical trajectory through the molecule minimizes the action
(20.1); but there are many such trajectories. Each is characterized by
the sequence in which the nuclei of the individual atoms are avoided
by going either clockwise or counterclockwise around them. Thus, we
can write down a word that consists of letters from a finite alphabet,
a, ii, b, b-. . . . where a indicates going clockwise and a going
counterclockwise around the atom A, and so on. This sequence can
be prescribed almost arbitrarily, with very few restrictions; e.g., the
trajectory cannot turn more than once around a particular atom before
visiting another one, and there is no use for the sequence a a, etc. On
the other hand, the trajectory can turn around B after hitting A, and
go back to A; that would imply a deflection by., in B, or equivalently,
hitting B with the angular momentum 0; the Coulomb singularity at the
center of each atom permits the electron to make this kind of U-turn.
The instability of these trajectories is obvious, as is their great proliferation, a sure sign of chaos.
The variational principle (20.1) can be given an intuitive, geometric
twist. Suppose that we want to construct the classical trajectory from

20.1 Electron Scattering in a Muffin-Tin Potential

387

some distant point (x', y') to the equally distant point (x", y'') corresponding to the word abcdeao as in Figure 68. A string is laid down
loosely according as the given word; the trajectory is then obtained
simply by tightening the string while making sure that it stays on the
two-dimensional surface with the metric (20.1) corresponding to the
muffin-tin potential.
In complete analogy to the scattering formula (19.31) for the particle on a surface of constant negative curvature, we can construct the
classical Green's function Gc(x" y'', x' y', E) with the help of the general formula (12.28). The determinant D(x" y", x' y', E) is calculated
using (2.1 0); since the scattering is elastic, the incoming and outgoing
velocities outside the molecule are the same, (2E/m) 112 . It is natural
to introduce polar coordinates (r, cf>) around some conveniently chosen
center of the molecule; the determinant D of second-order derivatives
acquires an extra factor 1/r" r' thereby; the derivatives at right angles
to the trajectory are now obtained simply by differentiating the action
integral with respect to the polar angles cf> 1 and cp". Thus,

complicated the trajectory through the molecule. It actually decreases
exponentially with the length of the trajectory inside the molecule; the
straight-line trajectories coming in and going out do not contribute.
Just as the general trace formula (17.13), the scattering formula
(20.2) is now seen as special case of the more general formula (12.28)
for positive energies. The exact scattering wave function (19.31) for
a singular quadrangle could have been obtained from this classical approximation; the expression (20.2) turns out to be correct quantummechanically on a surface of constant negative curvature, although it
is hard to understand why, since only the leading term in the limit of a
small Planck's quantum is considered.
The simple analysis of this section has recently been worked out in
great mathematical detail by various authors, including Jung and Scholz
(1987), Eckhardt (1987), Bltimel and Smilansky (1988), Gaspard and
Rice (1989), as well as Bleher, Ott, and Grebogi (1989). The models
differ from the muffin-tin molecule mostly because the scattering po-

388

Scattering, Coding, and Multifractals

tential is assumed to be repulsive rather than attractive; but there is
again a molecule which consists of at least three distinct mountains.
The code gives the sequence in which the scattered particle bounces
off one or the other; there is again an exponential proliferation and
exponential divergence of neighboring trajectories.
The same analysis applies to a number of recent experiments with
so-called ballistic electron transport (cf. van Houten et al. 1988, as well
as Beenakker and van Houten 1989). A two-dimensional metal can
be made between two layers of semiconductors, and given various
shapes on a scale of less than a micrometer = 10- 6 m :::::: 10000 atomic
distances. One common structure has four arms, two for the electric
current to enter and exit, and two to measure the voltage transverse to
the current. A magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the device
deflects the electrons, yielding a so-called Hall voltage. At very low
temperatures, the only scattering comes from the boundaries; their
concave shape makes the classical electron-motion chaotic. The voltage in the transverse direction is found to fluctuate (reproducibly) as
a function of the energy in the same manner as the phase shift in Figure

67.

The first step in the study of scattering problems is to understand
the classical trajectories and to extract some kind of scattering probability. We will not discuss this topic, except to remark again that purely
classical, as opposed to quantal, scattering is fraught with conceptual
difficulties. Also referring to the end of Section 10.5, but without further explanation, the metric entropy is in general larger than the
topological entropy; the difference can be directly interpreted as as an
escape rate for the particle to avoid getting caught in the molecular
tangle.
If the scattering potential corresponds to a pinball machine, with
circular obstacles of infinite height, the energy of the particle does not
matter classically; only the geometry is important. In quantum mechanics, however, the de Broglie wave-length is the essential parameter, exactly as in the scattering on a surface of constant negative
curvature. If the potential is smooth and of finite height less than E 0 ,
the transition from the free motion for energies E > E 0 , to the increasingly chaotic, classical motion for E < Eo is studied exhaustively
by Bieber, Grebogi, and Ott (1989). The scattering angle as a function
of the incoming angular momentum, for a fixed incoming direction, has
a striking fractal structure which can be explained as a sequence of
bifurcations as the energy E decreases. Of course, such fractals appear
also in the billiard-type scattering, just as they are present in the
muffin-tin molecule. The classical Green's function (20.2) provides

20.1 Electron Scattering in a Muffin-Tin Potential

389

the most reasonable, and presumably quite effective approximation to
the corresponding quanta} scattering.
Although these fractals are closely related to the ones that will be
discussed in the remainder of this chapter, none of the above quoted
authors has explicitly investigated the relation between the code on the
one hand and the physical variables on the other. So far, this last issue
has been discussed only by Gutzwiller and Mandelbrot (1988); although it is a purely classical problem, it may well be at the bottom of
the connection between classical and quantum mechanics. Thus, it
seems to be an appropriate topic for the last sections of this book.
The classical Green's function (20.2) is part and parcel of the general trace formula (17.13), exactly as the scattering formula (19.31)
for a singular quadrangle constitutes a generalization of Selberg's trace
formula (19.20). Therefore, we can expect quite generally the same
kind of chaotic behavior in the phase shift as was shown in Figure 67.
The local variations (called Ericson fluctuations in nuclear physics; cf.
Ericson 1960, 1963, and with Mayer-Kuckuk 1966) can be ascribed
to nearby singularities ('resonances') in the complex wave-number
plane; in the special example of Section 19.8, they are the zeroes of
Riemann's zeta-function. As discussed in Section 17.9, they are distributed like the eigenvalues of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
(GUE); according to Bltimel and Smilansky (1988), the scattering
resonances quite generally are distributed as the eigenvalues of the
appropriate random matrix ensemble. There is obviously a wide field
waiting to be studied.

20.2 The Coding of Geodesics on a Singular Polygon
The motion of a particle on a surface of constant negative curvature
will again be taken up in this section, and the following two. It provides
the simplest, and most striking example for the relation between the
two complementary ways of looking at classically chaotic systems,
phase space on one hand, and the coding of trajectories on the other.
In order to evaluate the phase shift on a singular quadrangle, the
double cosets in (19.31) have to be enumerated in some effective
manner. In looking for such a scheme, our model is the binary code
which we found for the AKP in Chapter 11, and used in Section 17.11
to calculate the right-hand side of the trace formula. We would have
liked to accomplish this feat for the double torus, i.e., the octogon in
the hyperbolic plane; but the coding is much easier for the singular
polygons; for the double torus, it will be discussed very briefly at the

390

Scattering, Coding, and Multifractals

end of this section. Here, we will concentrate on the special case of the
singular square, rather than some general polygon, because it shows all
the interesting features, and the generalization is straightforward.
The idea for this code comes from a number of papers of Series
(1985a, 1985b, and 1986); but as in the other instances of this chapter,
the mathematical results were apparently derived with the intention of
understanding hyperbolic geometry, rather than grasping the relation
between classical and quantum mechanics in a system with hard chaos.
It was then left to the author (Gutzwiller and Mandelbrot 1988) to
recast the basic ideas of the mathematicians into a physically oriented
picture.
The singular square D3 is shown in Figure 63; its four singular corners are on the real x-axis in -1, 0, + 1, and oo; opposite sides are
mapped into each other by the transformations A =
and B = [ e , - e; - e , (1 + e2 ) I e] where
[ e , e ; e , (1 + e2 ) I e]
- oo < e < + oc, as mentioned at the end of Section 19.7. The simple
scattering formula (19.28) was based on e = 1; but nothing in this
section ties us to this special case.
A geodesic is represented in the upper half-plane by a Euclidean
circle whose center lies on the x-axis; its intersections with the x-axis
are called ~ and T]; the motion is always from ~to TJ, as was explained
already in Section 19.2, and shown in Figure 54. The four corners of
the singular square divide the real axis into four intervals which will be
called {1} = (- oo,- 1), {2} = (-1,0), {3} = (0,1), and {4} =
(l,+oo); the four sides of D 3 are given the same names. The necessary
and sufficient condition for a geodesic to cut D3 is for the two endpoints to belong to two different intervals; the interval to which~ belongs will be called the entry, and the interval of TJ the exit.
To each exit interval belongs one of the four operations which maps
the corresponding side into its opposite: {1} calls for A which maps {1}
into {3}, {2} calls for B- 1, which maps {2} into {4}, {3} calls for A- 1,
and {4} for B; a similar pairing goes with the entry intervals. The exit
map into the opposite side changes TJ into TJJ, while the entry map
changes ~ into ~ 1 ; this procedure can be continued, yielding TJ2 at the
next exit, and ~ 2 at the preceding entry, and so on. The sequence
TJ, TJJ, TJ 2 , ... describes the forward motion, and depends only on the initial value TJ, while the sequence t ~ 1 • ~ 2 , ... describes the backward
motion, and depends only on~In the following discussion, we will concentrate on the forward sequence TJ, TJ 1, ••• ; everything works out the same way for the backward
sequence~. ~ 1 , •..• This complete separation of the future and the past
is remarkable; it comes about because the broken linear transformation
[a, b ; c, d] acts according as ( 19. 7) on ~ and TJ separately. The inde-

20.2 The Coding of Geodesics on a Singular Polygon

391

pendence of past and future applies in this simple form only to the
singular polygons; it is, of course, a symptom of chaos just as when a
die is thrown, and nothing in the past of the gambler permits any conclusion concerning the next move.
The sequence of intervals corresponding to the consecutive values
of 1J constitutes a good code for the forward trajectory; but there are
obvious limitations. If 1J E {3}, i.e., the geodesic leaves D3 through
the side {3}, the map A- 1 will transform the exit point into an entry
point on the side {1}. The new exit point is bound to be either on {2},
or on {3}, or on {4}; but it cannot be on {1 }. The triple choice to be
made can be characterized more intuitively as right-center-left, since
looking from {1} into the singular square, the side {2} is on the right,
{3} is straight ahead, and {4} is on the left.
This triple choice is seen directly in Figure 63; instead of moving the
geodesic back into the original domain D 3 with the help of A -I, we
make a copy A D 3 of D 3 with the help of A. The three new exit sides
are three contiguous, small Euclidean circles centered on the real axis,
which fill completely the previous exit side {3}; they are in the correct
order right-straight-left. If 'IJI E {2}, i.e., the geodesic makes a right
turn upon leaving the original D 3 , it will hit the first of the small circles
inside {3}. If we were still in the original domain, the side {2} would
have to be mapped into {4} with the help B -I; instead, we can make a
new copy AB D 3 of D 3 by mapping first with Band then with A. The
small circle corresponding to the side {2} on A D 3 is divided into three
even smaller circles which correspond to the three new possible exits,
{1}, {2}, or {3}, again in the correct order.
The continued subdivision into three contiguous subintervals is
quite obvious in Figure 63, and leads naturally to the ternary code corresponding to the triple choice right-center-left at each stage. There
is no limitation on the words that can be formed in this manner from
the letters R (right), S (straight), and L (left). Given 'IJ, the algortihm
for finding the ternary code is straightforward: in the example above,
one starts with 1J E {3}; applying the map A- 1 one obtains 'IJI; since
it turns out that 'IJI E {2}, the first letter in the code word is R; the exit
side {2} dictates the map of 1] 1 by B- 1 which yields '1] 2 ; according as
'1] 2 E { 1}, {2}, or {3}, the second letter in the code is R, S, or L; an
so on. Thus, 1J generates the first exit side, {3}, plus a unique ternary
code word starting with R.
Conversely, if an initial exit side and a ternary code word is given,
Figure 63 suggests how to find the subinterval on the real axis where
1J is located. It takes some rather obvious mathematics to show that a
code word of finite length leads to a subinterval of non-vanishing
length, and that this subinterval shrinks to a point as the code word

Scattering, Coding, and Multifractals

Figure 70 The singular square in the unit-disk model of the hyperbolic plane;
the concave diamond shape of the domain can be found also in the
diamagnetic Kepler problem, and is the cause for the chaos there as well. The
ternary code simply records whether the trajectory entering, say, in { 1} turns
right, goes straight, or turns left.

becomes infinitely long. The reader should be warned, however, that
the distribution of these subintervals is very uneven; a sharp, quantitative statement of this fact will be given in the next section.
The code word for a given endpoint 11 is easy to compute, if the
above algorithm is used. If 11 is known to a certain precision, say A1j,
the length of the code word is limited roughly to - log(A1/)/log3; indeed, the consecutive maps have the effect of spreading 1/J from one
of the four intervals, {1}, {2}, {3}, or {4}, to one of the three possible
subintervals for each of them; the uncertainty A1j then gets multiplied
by 3 approximately.
The reverse process of obtaining 11 from the given initial exit side
and the given ternary code word, however, is quite different. First off,
the sequence of mappings has to be determined: again, suppose that the
initial exit interval is {3}, and the code word begins with RL ... ; {3} requires A - 1 to get us to {1}; R then leads to {2} which requires B - 1 to
get us to {4}; L then leads to {3} which requires A - 1, and so forth; the
computation so far is purely logical. Secondly, the original domain D 3
has to be mapped by the inverse sequence, i.e., ...ABA in this case; the
resulting copy .. .ABA D 3 spans a short interval on the real axis which
is most easily obtained by calculating the four corners, i.e., by finding
the images of -1, 0, + 1, and oo. The value of 11 is found in this interval;
its total length is roughly given by as many powers of 1/3 as letters in
the code word.

20.2 The Coding of Geodesics on a Singular Polygon

393

Figure 63 looks somewhat asymmetric; the sides {1} and {4} get
an infinite interval on the x-axis, whereas {2} and {3} get an unit interval each. If the singular quadrangle is mapped into the unit circle
with the help of (19.9), we get Figure 70 which is completely equivalent to Figure 63. Nevertheless, Figure 70 immediately inspires us to
make the comparison with other Hamiltonian systems where the same
kind of coding is equally effective, because the equipotential curves
have the same concave diamond shape. Indeed, one could consider a
Euclidean billiard inside the four Euclidean circles of Figure 70; in the
same vein, Giannoni and Ullmo (1990) have studied the motion inside
a singular triangle of the hyperbolic plane.
Most remarkably, the equipotential curves for the diamagnetic
Kepler problem in the semiparabolic coordinates (p., v) have the same
diamond-shape, as shown in the potential-energy term of the
Schrodinger equation (18 .13), or more explicitly in the article by
Reinhardt and Farrelly ( 1982). That fact is the basis for the successful
coding of the trajectories by Eckhardt and Wintgen (1990). Finally,
the planar-metal device mentioned at the end of the last section (cf.
Beenakker and van Houten 1989) owes the fluctuations in its Hall
voltage to the same chaotic scattering in a diamond shape. The chaotic
features can also be seen in the conductance calculations of Avishai
and Band (1990).

20.3 The Geometry of the Continued Fractions
A particularly simple example for this kind of code is due to Series
(1985a and b), although it goes back to Artin (1924). It will be used
in the next section to demonstrate some novel features in chaotic
Hamiltonian systems. The singular triangle D 2 was defined in Section
19.7; it is bounded by the vertical lines x = 0 and x = 1, as well as the
Euclidean circle (x - 1/2) 2 + y 2 = 1/4, and constitutes one-half of
the singular square D 3 .
Exactly the same construction of a code can be applied; but there
are only three intervals on the real axis: {1} = (- oo, 0), {2} = (0,+ 1),
and {3} = (+1,+oo). The mappings which are needed to bring a
geodesic back into D 2 , are not as natural as in the singular square; the
following definitions differ from what was said in Section 19.7. The
geodesic is assumed to enter through {1}, and leave through {2} or {3},
so that ~ < 0 and 11 > 0; we will discuss only the forward map. If
11 e: {2}, then {2} is mapped into {1} by11-111 = S(TJ) = 11/0-11);
if 11 e: {3}, then {3} is also mapped into {1}, using the translation

394

Scattering, Coding, and Multifractals

11-+ 111 = T(YJ) = 11 -1. In Section 19.7, the group of maps for D 2
was generated differently; nevertheless, the tilings of the upper halfplane are the same, although the sides of the singular triangle are not
identified in the same way.
The code is now binary, with the letter R (right) for {2}, and the
letter L (left) for {3}; the exit coordinate 11 determines the binary sequence, and vice versa. The same procedure could be used to go from
one to the other as above; but Series proposed a more direct method
which has been known in a different guise for some time (cf. Adler and
Flatto 1982).
Let us describe the binary sequence by a sequence of integers
(n 0 , n 1 , n2 , ... ), where no ;::: 0 and n1 > 0 for j > 0; it indicates no times
L, followed by n 1 times R, followed by n2 times L, and so on. Almost
trivially, although quite unexpectedly, one has
1

indeed, suppose that 11 has been represented by this continued fraction
(cf. Section 9.5); if n0 > 0, it requires n0 translations T to get from 11
in {3} to TJno = 11 - n 0 in {2}; now the mapS has to be used n 1 times,
in order to find YJno + nt given by an expression similar to (20.3), but n1
replaced by n1 + 2 ; a second cycle can now start as before.
The map between the binary code and the continued fractions came
rather naturally out of a purely geometric problem, namely the
geodesics in a singular triangle. The binary code describes how the
geodesic winds itself through the tiling of the hyperbolic plane, whereas
the continued fraction gives the exit point 11 for the geodesic. These
two aspects of the same geodesic are uniquely determined by two entirely different mathematical objects, the purely logical code word on
one hand, and the purely arithmetical continued fraction on the other.
The explicit relation between these two objects is a model for describing chaotic Hamiltonian systems, such as we found already in the AKP.
Since a substantial part of Chapter 19 was spent on studying the
double torus (compact two-dimensional manifold of genus 2) of constant negative curvature, the question of coding for its geodesics will
be taken up briefly. In principle, the four generators A, B, C, D and
their inverses could be used, in exact analogy to the generators A, B
with their inverses in the case of the singular quadrangle. The difficulty
with this scheme is the relation (19 .11) between the four generators
which eliminates an increasing number of words as they become
longer; the restrictions on the alphabet are not easy to implement, and
the corresponding partitioning of phase space is very complicated.

20.3 The Geometry of the Continued Fractions

395

The relation (19 .11) goes directly back to the definition of the
homotopy group for the double torus, and is based on Figure 57. The
resulting octogon (Figure 56) tiles the hyperbolic plane; but a geodesic
which bounds one particular octagonal tile, in general pierces a neighboring tile when this geodesic is produced indefinitely. This unfortunate circumstance can be avoided with the help of a construction by
Nielsen (1927), which was discussed in more detail by Bowen and Series (1979) as well as Series (1986), and finally worked out completely
by Adler and Flatto (1989).
The double torus is sliced open by cutting along four periodic
geodesics; if we refer to Figure 58, we could choose the two geodesics
which define the perimeter of each torus, plus the geodesic defining the
distance between them, and the circumference of th~: right-hand torus.
The 'skin' presents itself now as a dodecagon in the hyperbolic plane;
only four 12-sided tiles meet in each vertex; the twelve sides of the
original dodecagon can be produced, until they intersect the limiting unit
circle which gets divided thereby into 24 adjoining intervals, to be
named with the first 24 letters of the alphabet, a, b, ... , w , x.
The endpoints ~ and 11 of an arbitrary geodesic are now specified
by the interval on the unit circle to which they belong. Upon leaving
the dodecagon, the geodesic undergoes the appropriate bilinear transformation; there are now six of them plus their inverses, and the
endpoints of the geodesic, ~ and 17, get transformed accordingly. The
code registers the successive intervals to which ~ and 11 belong; any
particular interval cannot be succeeded by all the 23 others, however,
but only by a subset. There is a 24 bv 24 matrix indicating which two
letters can follow one another. In the language of ergodic theory, we have
a subshift (cf. Section 10.1). Although this scheme looks more complicated than the homotopy group with the relation ( 19.11), the subshift sets conditions only between two consecutive letters, while the
relation ( 19.11) involves eight symbols in sequence.

20.4 A New Measure in Phase Space Based on the Coding
The vertical line x = 0 in the Poincare upper half-plane would normally
serve as a surface of section for the flow of geodesics. As an alternative
for the coordinates in a surface of section, however, we can use the
coordinates ~ and 11 of the endpoints of a geodesic, as shown in Figure
54. When the trajectory intersects the vertical x = 0, its vertical momentum v and its positiony can be expressed in terms of~ and 11· Thus,
the invariant volume dw on this usual surface of section can be ex-

396

pressed in terms of the endpoint coordinates
yields the expression

= dvdy =

a, 17). The calculation
(20.4)

If both ~ and 11 are subjected to the same transformation
[a, b ; c, d ], it is easy to check that this volume element remains the
same. We will use (20.4) as the Liouville measure for the motion of a
particle on a surface of constant negative curvature.

In the motion on the singular polygon, the endpoint coordinates ~
and 11 belong to different intervals on the x-axis. Figure 71 shows the
admissible points in the shaded region. The total area of this region
with the measure (20.4) is infinite, reflecting the non-compact nature
of this dynamical system. The lines ~ = constant are the unstable
manifolds, while the lines 11 = constant are the stable manifolds. Indeed, all the geodesics with the same 11 approach one another exponentially with distance as they move toward the real axis of Poincare's
upper half-plane; similarly, the trajectories with the same ~ emerge
from the same point, as the particle on them is followed backwards in
time.
Everytime the geodesic tries to leave the domain D 3 , it has to be
mapped by A, B, or their inverses. The same mapping applies to~ and
11; the resulting points in the ( ~, 11) plane represent the geodesic in the
surface of section as usual.

20.4 Measure in Phase Space Based on the Coding

397

The geodesic is equally well described by the ternary code, however; according as the discussion in the preceding section, we adopt the
following notation: first, we specify the side through which the
geodesic enters D 3 , say {1}; then we give the code word forward as
well as backward in time, say ... LSL{ 1} RLS ... ; it says that after crossing {1}, the geodesic makes a right turn, then a left turn, then moves
straight, and so on into the future. Similarly, in order to hit {1}, the
geodesic made a left turn, which was preceded by a straight motion,
whose predecessor was a left turn, and so on out of the past. The
geodesic is uniquely determined with this information.
When the geodesic leaves D 3 , it has to be mapped as explained
above; its code changes, but only in a very simple way. To take the
above example, after entering through {1} and making a right turn, the
geodesic leaves through the side {2}; the map B- 1 makes it enter
through {4}; the new code becomes ... LSLR{4}LS ... , where the sequence {1} R in the center of the word has been replaced by sequence
R {4}, while the remaining letters are the same as before. If we disregard the replacement of {1} by {4}, all that has happened is to shift the
first letter in the word for the future into first position of the word for
the past.
The code word can be given a measure in the standard manner: a
ternary digit cis associated with each letter; 0 for R, 1 for S, and 2 for
L. The real number 0 :5 (} :5 1 has the ternary representation given by
the code word for the future; similarly, the real number 0 :5 E> :5 1 has
the ternary representation given by the code word for the past;
oc

e = l:c-)3-j- 1 ,e = 2:cj3-1 .

(20.5)

If necessary, there can be four kinds of such pairs (E>, 0) to accommo-

date the four possibilities for the entry-interval.
This ternary representation defines another measure on the surface
of section, dE> dO. As in the binary sequences for the AKP, the
Poincare map of the surface of section into itself is equivalent to shifting all ternaries c1 to the left, c'1 = c1 + 1 . The scale of E> gets contracted by a factor three, while the scale of(} gets expanded by the same
factor three. The square -1~8,8~1 undergoes a ternary bakers'
transformation which preserves the area, every time the geodesic has
to be mapped in order to stay inside the singular square.
The endpoint coordinates a·, 17) can now be mapped into the number pairs (E>, 0) representing the code word; the argument in the preceding section shows that this map is essentially one-to-one and
continuous. Therefore, a new invariant measure in a surface of section,
or more generally in phase space, is naturally associated with the code

398

Scattering, Coding, and Multifractals

for the trajectories. How is this new measure related to the traditional
Liouville measure (20.4 )? In spite of the one-to-one and continuous
relation between the two kinds of coordinates, each measure will now be
shown to be fractal in terms to the other.
The demonstration will be simplified by investigating only how the
exit coordinate T/ is related to the ternary representation 8 of the code
word for the future. We discussed in the preceding section the algorithms which allow us to go from one to the other, in either direction.
Figure 72 gives a graph of the function 8(1'/) for different values of the
parameter e in the transformations of the singular square, as explained
at the end of Section 19.7.
These functions are obviously highly singular, with both very steep
and very flat portions; but they are not ordinary 'devil's staircases'
which are constant except at a denumerable set of points where they
jump discontinuously (cf. Bak and Bruinsma 1982). The designation
as 'slippery devil's staircase' seems quite appropriate for this new kind
of function (cf. Gutzwiller and Mandelbrot 1988). The almost constant portion of these functions indicate that a large change in T/ does
not alter much the code word; the geodesic gets trapped, and, as a
closer inspection shows, it winds for many turns around the exponential
horn, making either many consecutive left or right turns. The nearly
vertical portions, on the other hand, display the extreme sensitivity of
the geodesic's qualitative behavior with respect to small changes in 1'/;
they occur mainly when there are many straight motions, so that the
geodesic wanders around the torus proper rather than on the attached
exponential horn.

20.5 Invariant Multifractal Measures in Phase Space
The analytical character of the functions 8(1'/) is best understood in
terms of a multifractal set; we will give the most primitive version of
this modern concept which was first proposed by Mandelbrot (1982),
and has since been studied extensively (cf. Frisch and Parisi 1985;
Halsey, Jensen, Kadanoff, Procaccia, and Shraiman 1986). In order
to simplify the arithmetic, we shall only discuss the example of the
geodesics in the singular triangle at the end of the last section.
A function /3(1'/) is defined as follows: 0 < T/ < 1 is represented as
the continued fraction (20.3) where no = 0, while 0 < f3 < 1 is the
real number whose binary expansion consists of n 1 -1 times 0, followed by n2 times 1, followed by n3 times 0, and so on. This function
and its inverse, calculated separately, are shown in Figure 73; it has the

latter are even more irregular than the former.
The nearly flat portions of f3(TJ) are found on an everywhere dense
set, but not in whole intervals. The bottom of the curve shows this

f3 ~ exp( -n 1log2) ~ exp[ - (log2)/ril .
(20.6)
All derivatives vanish, although the function is not constant. The same
behavior is found every time TJ gets close to a rational number, because
there is then a large integer n1 in its continued fraction. This remarkable property characterizes a slippery devil's staircase.
The more detailed analysis of the function f3(TJ) is based on assuming that fl/3 ~ (flTJ)o: in some small neighborhood. The Holder exponent
a is calculated from the finite differences
a= log[f3(TJ + fiTJ) - f3(TJ)J/log(flTJ) = Iogtlf3/logflTJ. (20.7)
In practice, the whole interval for TJ is divided into 100,000 equal pieces
ilTJ, and the corresponding fl/3 is calculated.
The distribution of the a's is extremely singular; the points where a
has a fixed value is a fractal subset of the interval 0 < TJ < 1 whose dimension will be called f(a). For its calculation, the following scheme

is adopted: the a's obtained from (20.7) are put into 100 bins of equal
size Lla; if the number in the bin around a is called N(a), then
log [N(a)/ Lla]
(20.8)
f(a) =
log [ 1/ Ll17]
The idea behind this formula is quite elementary, and follows one of
the definitions of the Hausdorff dimension: The points in the interval
O~ry~l which are characterized by the exponent a are covered by
the small intervals of length 6.17; there are N = N(a)/ Lla of them. The
fractal dimension for this subset is the exponent f = f(a), which
guarantees the relation N (Ll1JY = 1, and yields (20.8).
This function is plotted in Figure 74; it stops abruptly at 6.6 for the
following reason: the calculations were carried out in quadruple precision, i.e., with 112 significant bits or an accuracy of Llf3 ~ lQ-33.
About 10% of these differences, however, are even smaller and were
put equal to 0; therefore, no data are available for a> 33/5 = 6.6
since 6.17 = I0- 5 . The lower end of the f(a) curve comes from the
point with the largest difference ll./3. It arises for 1J = y, the golden
mean, and f3 = 2/3, and is given by amin = log2/log(l/y 2 ) = 0.7202.
The inverse function 17(/3) can be investigated in a similar manner.
Its f( a) curve is plotted in Figure 7 5. Instead of the long tail in Figure
74, we now find a long head. The beginning portion in Figure 7 5 is

actually linear with slope 1, as nearly as the finite statistics of the
computational data permit to show this feature. The: constant difference Ll/3 was chosen as 2- 26 ; the largest jump occurs at f3 = 0 and 1
where Ll17 = 1/26, so that according as (20.7) we find a ~ log 26/26
log 2 = .1786. On the other hand, the minimum value of a in the preceding paragraph now yields amax = log(y- 2 )/log 2 = 1.3885.
The foregoing analysis of the functions /3(17) and 17(/3) is a most
primitive first effort which is probably beset by poor statistics. By the
standards of the experts in this multifractal trade, the above example
seems pathological, just as ordinary fractals seemed at one time questionable products of some mathematician's distorted fantasy. On the
contrary, the above functions appear to be typical of Hamiltonian systems with hard chaos, as the discussion of the Anisotropic Kepler
Problem in the next sections will show.
The invariant measure in phase space that is based on the coding
of the trajectories has in general this multifractal character with respect
to the usual Liouville measure. Although this feature has not been exploited as yet, it is bound to be important for the evaluation of the trace
formula. The f(a) curve is only a first, rather crude, but very telling
indication of the hidden complications which are found even in a simple
Hamiltonian system with hard chaos, such as the geodesics in a singular
polygon.

20.6 Multifractals in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem
The multifractal analysis of the preceding section is a first step toward
the transition from hard to soft chaos. The last two sections of this
book are designed to start an overdue discussion of this topic. In order
to understand the urgency of such a project, we have to go back to
some of the earlier sections, in particular Chapter 9 on Soft Chaos and
the KAM Theorem and Chapter 10 on Entropy.
The two extremes of a Hamiltonian system are described by two
particularly simple types of organization in phase space: on the one
hand, in an integrable system there are as many integrals of motion as
degrees of freedom, and phase space gets foliated into a set of invariant
tori. On the other hand, in a system with hard chaos there is a double
foliation into (stable and unstable) submanifolds, each with as many
dimensions as degrees of freedom, and each trajectory is the intersection of a submanifold from one foliation with a submanifold from
the other foliation. Figure 26 shows the surface of section in the latter
case, for the Anisotropic Kepler Problem (AKP) with mass ratio 5.
The foliation for the integrable Hamiltonians cannot maintain itself,
even under a weak perturbation, e.g., in the potential energy. The
KAM theorem tells us to what extent the invariant tori resist the de-

20.6 Multifractals in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem

403

structive effect and incipient chaos due to such small changes; as a rule,
only the tori with sufficiently irrational frequency ratios remain for a
perturbation of moderate strength. Accordingly, integrable systems
are very exceptional, and it is unfortunate that our whole intuition in
mechanics, classical as well as quantum, and perhaps even statistical,
is based on the experience with these special cases, although nobody
doubts their great historical importance.
The double foliation into stable and unstable manifolds, on the
contrary, does not change qualitatively, even under perturbations of
moderate strength. This type of organization in phase space is structurally stable, and there are many more Hamiltonian systems of this
kind than integrable ones. The great variety of Riemannian surfaces
with constant negative, as opposed to positive, curvature provides the
most striking demonstration of this situation. Also, the original arguments of Hadamard (1898) concerning the chaotic nature of geodesics
are all based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (19.10), and are, therefore,
valid for any surface whose Gaussian curvature is strictly negative, although it may vary from place to place. In contrast, strictly positive
curvature without rotational symmetry, like on the surface of a potato,
does not guarantee the integrability of the geodesics.
Generic Hamiltonian systems belong to the category of soft chaos
where some parts of phase space have foliations into invariant tori
while others have the double foliation into stable and unstable manifolds. The two complementary regions penetrate into each other in a
most intimate and fractal fashion. Rather than to describe the newly
created layers of chaos between the remaining invariant tori, it seems
more reasonable to try to understand how isolated islands of tori can
arise somewhere inside the double foliation of a system with hard
chaos.
The AKP presents a system where this transition can be followed
in function of its two main parameters: the mass ratio, JLI v in the normalization (11.4), and the angular momentum M around the
longitudinal (heavy) axis. In this section, we will discuss some recent
calculations of the author (Gutzwiller 1989) concerning the effect of
changing the mass ratio, along the lines of the preceding section. Only
a few preliminary calculations were carried out for M ¢ 0; they will
be mentioned shortly in the next section.
Figure 26 shows in graphic detail how the numbers ( t T/), representing the binary coding for the trajectories in the AKP, are related to
the points in the surface of section that is the heavy axis. There seems
little doubt that this relation is one-to-one and continuous, if the mass
ratio is 5. The leaves in each of the two foliations are labeled by
equidistant values of ~ and 71; nevertheless, they do not seem equally

404

Scattering, Coding, and Multifractals

spaced in the surface of section. This situation was described in terms
of a Holder exponent a in formula (11.14 ), an idea that will be pursued
more systematically in this section.
A multifractal analysis of the AKP has to deal with the whole twodimensional surface of section of Figure 26; but the ingredients for
such an investigation are not in place as yet, it seems. The singular
polygons of constant negative curvature (cf. the preceding three
sections) are exceptional, because on the one hand the stable and unstable manifolds in the surface of section are simply the horizontal and
the vertical lines as shown in Figure 71, while on the other hand the
(ternary) coding clearly separates past from future. Therefore, the
two-dimensional map between the surface of section and the coding
decays into a product of two one-dimensional maps like Figure 72.
The task for the AKP will be simplified by considering only the
special trajectories that are symmetric with respect to the heavy axis;
they intersect the x-axis at time t = 0 at a right angle. Their binary
sequence is symmetric such that a_1 = a1; the symmetry of the potential with respect to the y-axis allows us to consider only the case
where ao = sign(xo) > 0. Moreover, since the momentum in the
x-direction uo = 0 for these trajectories, we find that x 0 = Xo according as (11. 9).
The calculations become quite simple: the initial coordinate x 0 is
increased in equal steps over its whole interval from 0 to 2. The
equations of motion are integrated numerically out to some large
number of intersections with the surface of section. With the programming skill and computing resources available, .xo was increased in
steps of .0002, and 48 intersections were obtained for each trajectory.
The mass ratio was chosen to be 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0, and 13.0, imitating a Fibonacci series.
Figure 7 6 gives the corresponding plots of the binary label 1J from
(11.10) as a function of x 0 . Before going to a more detailed analysis,
the first striking feature is the monotonic increase: with the glaring
exception of a short interval near x0 = .01 for the mass ratio 1.5, the
value of 1J was always found to be strictly increasing, although it
sometimes did so only with excruciating slowness as .xo increased in
steps of equal size. On the other hand, the value of 1J remained constant in the exceptional interval for mass ratio 1.5; but it registered a
strictly monotonic increase elsewhere, in particular in the long, seemingly flat portion around .xo = 1.
The multifractal analysis of these curves follows the same recipes
(20.7) and (20.8) as were used to obtain Figure 74 from Figure 73.
The reader has to make a slight shift in nomenclature; the coordinate
1J on the surface of section in Figures 73 and 74 becomes .xo in Figures

very subtle numerological features hidden in the dynamical system. A

(20.6) that the function f3(1J) has all derivatives vanishing wherever 1J
is rational. The physical reason for the similar phenomenon in the
singular squares was the trapping of the trajectories near the exit-entry
at oo.
The horizontal portions in the AKP are again due to trapping: for
small mass ratios, the 'Kepler' orbit, with the binary period ( + - )
corresponding to 1J = 1/3, attracts trajectories from a large part of

20.6 Multifractals in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem

407

phase space, although they will eventually again leave that neighborhood; for large mass ratios, the trajectories get trapped along the heavy
x-axis, which leads to a preference for the values 11 = 3/4, 7/8, 15/16,
... corresponding to long strings of equal binary symbols.
The width of the f(a) curves in the AKP again seems to exceed all
the algebraic examples that were constructed by the promoters of this
idea such as Halsey et al. (1986). It should be stressed, however, that
the display of such curves is not an aim in itself; they are only a first
and rather crude step in understanding the relation between the dynamical variables in phase space and the symbol sequences that define
the kinematic history of the physical trajectories.

20.7 Bundling versus Pruning a Binary Tree
The binary coding of trajectories in the Anisotropic Kepler Problem is
just one particularly simple example of hard chaos. To be entirely
convincing, it would be necessary to complete the theorem which was
proved by Devaney (1978a, b, and c) and the author (Gutzwiller
1977), and to show that there is no more than one trajectory for each
binary sequence (cf. Section 11.3). While there is plenty of numerical
evidence in favor of this proposition, the proof is missing.
Devaney instigated Roger Broucke to find a counterexample in the
form of a stable periodic orbit. There was no other way to accomplish
this goal except by searching numerically through the surface of section
for low mass ratios. One obvious candidate, the 'Kepler' orbit with the
binary period ( + - ), was ruled out because the author (Gutzwiller
1971) had shown that it is unstable as soon as the mass ratio differs
from 1; the stability exponent goes to zero linearly with the mass ratio.
The existence of at least one trajectory corresponding to a particular
binary sequence is guaranteed for mass ratios greater than 9/8. The
challenge, to find a stable periodic orbit for J..Liv > 9/8, was met by
Broucke (1985) who published the parameters for one particular case
of mass ratio 1.7218. Its binary sequence is the indefinite repetition
of ( + - - + - - ) ; it intersects the x-axis perpendicularly at a
place ever closer to the origin as the mass ratio decreases; in a manner
of speaking, it gets driven toward the origin by the expanding 'basin'
of the 'Kepler' orbit.
The periodic orbit ( + - - + - - ) becomes unstable when
the mass ratio goes up to 2; but it is present without interruption in an
interval starting at 1. It is obviously interesting to know what happens
in its neighborhood; although the relevant calculations have been per-

formed only at a few mass ratios, in particular for 1.5, the results are
assumed to be valid throughout this interval.
First, a search was undertaken along the X-axis of the surface of
section, using the coordinates ( U, X) in the rectangle defined by the
formulas (11.9). All trajectories starting with 0.0022 =::; X=::; 0.0152
have the same binary sequence, namely
U = 0
and
( + - - + - - ) repeating indefinitely, although they are not
periodic. A similar search, varying X while keeping U constant, always
yields an interval of this kind, as long as U < 0.9. These intervals can
be fitted together to form an elongated, narrow island, to be called
Broucke's island for its discoverer.
Now it becomes crucial to find out how the AKP manages to
produce all the trajectories whose binary sequences differ only in very
late binaries from the indefinite repetition of ( + - - + - - ).
For this purpose we revert to the construction of the stable and unstable manifold in Section 11.4. With sufficient patience we find the two
collision trajectories that start with either I - - + - - + ) or
with I - + - - + ) to be followed by seven repetitions of
( - - + - - + ). The 48-th intersection of the first lies to the
left, whereas the 47-th intersection of the second lies to the right of
Broucke's island in the surface of section.

20.7 Bundling versus Pruning a Binary Tree

409

Since 2-48!::do-ts, it is hard to believe that the unstable manifolds
for
these
two collision trajectories succeed in being
0.0152- 0.0022 = 0.013 apart, to make space for Broucke's island;
but Figure 78 shows the corresponding sliver in the surface of section.
More computations are necessary to establish what happens in the
neighborhood of this boundary; the inside of this island probably contains a set of concentric invariant tori, with Broucke's stable periodic
orbit at the core.
The emerging picture suggests that the foliation into stable and unstable manifolds is still in place at the mass ratio 1.5; but an island with
a set of invariant tori has been squeezed in between adjacent leaves.
The binary tree is still complete, except that some of its branches have
been bundled together to make an opening for the island. A short, but
non-vanishing interval appears in Figure 76 where 11 has a constant
value; the staircase ceases to be slippery at this point, although it does
not have any point where it drops vertically. The bundling feature is a
consequence of the theorem in Section 11.3, which prevents any binary
sequence from getting lost as the mass ratio goes down to 9/8.
If the angular momentum M around the heavy axis is allowed to
differ from zero, however, they-coordinate has to be interpreted as the
radial distance from the heavy x-axis, as indicated in the Hamitonian
(11.6). The centrifugal repulsion overwhelms the Coulomb attraction;
y = p can no longer vanish. The surface of section has to be redefined, along with a criterion for defining a binary sequence to go with
every trajectory. Long sequences of identical binaries no longer occur;
they get pruned out, and the de vii's staircase shows (vertical) jumps.
Again, soft chaos is seen to yield the usual kind of devil's staircase,
whereas hard chaos leads to the slippery kind.
