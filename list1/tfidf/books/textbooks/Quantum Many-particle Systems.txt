Editor's Foreword

Perseus Books's FTontiers in Physics series has, since 1961, made it ~ossiblefor
leading physicis~to communicate in coherent fashion their views of recent developments in the most exciting and active fields of physics--without having to
devote the time and energy required to prepare a formal review or monograph.
Indeed, throughout its nearly forty-year existence, the series has emphasized
informaliq in both style and content, as well as pedagogical clarity, Over time, it
was expected that these informal accounts A d be replaced by more formal
counterparts-textboks or monogmphs-as the cutting-edge topics they treated
gradually became integrated into the body of physics knowledge and reader interest dwindled. However, this has mt proven to be the case for a number of the
volumes in the series; M a y works have remained in print c
m an on-demmd
basis, while others have such intrinsic value that the physics community has
urged us to extend their life span.
T h e Advamelrl Book Classics series has been desimed to meet this demand. X

PREFACE

The problem of understandkgthe properties of quantum systems possessing large
or Infinite numbers of degrws of free-dom pemdes all of theoretical physics. Hence,
the thear&icail methods and the physical insight which have bwn devdoped over the
years for quantum many-particle systems campdse an esential part of the educatjon
of students in diwiptlnes as diverse as solid state physics, field thwry, atornlc physics,
mndensed matter physics, quantum chemistry and nuclear phydcs. During the past
decade, we have taught one and two-semester courses on the quantum tkmry of
many-particle systems to graduate students in them disciptfnes at the Massachusats
institute of Technology, and this book Is;an autgrowth of these lectum.
Compard to the texts that appeared in the early 1970%.we have presented standard topiia from a dimrent pasrspective and Included a number of new developments.
Because of the physical appeal and utllity of the kynnnan path integral, we have used
functional integrals as the foundation of our presttntatiion. Eunctbnal integral teichniques proliide an economical formalism for d&ving familiar results, such as perturbation wpansions, and yfeld valuable new apvaximations and insight into such proWems
as quantum callective motion, tunneilng daay, and phase transitions, Because of the
power and physicat lnsights provMdrsd by these twhniques and their prevalence in the
literature, we believe it is essential to teach them to students at this level.
Order parameters and brobn symmetry play crucial roles in charactedzing and understandjng the phases in whlch matter exists and the transitions betwen these phases*
These concepts, which are familiar frorn the Landau theory of phase transitions, arise
quite naturalry frorn our generat development In krms of functional htegvals, and are
discuss& in detail in this text.
Another new taptc is the use of stochastic methods for many-body probterns.
Techniques have misted for a long ltime to use Markov random walks and Monte Carlo
M e s 6f phydcal "rnterat
evaluation of integrals to calculate quantum mt3chanieai ob
to any desired degree of accuracy" In the past, such mhnlques have rewived less attention than analytic methods involving summations of diagrams having undeternind
convergence propeeies or other ultimately uncontroltd approdmations. We believe
that stochastic methods are Intellectually interesl-ing in their awn right and that they
provide a powerFul tool to obtain definitive answers to certain classes of otherwliw
insolvable problems;. Hence, we have included a pedagogical introduction to stschastic
methods, showing hew to calculate obsewables of interest, stressing the physical connection with path integrals, and demonstrathng how to tailor the method to the physics
of the problem under consideration.
The scope of this book is Intend& to be sufficleMly broad to serve as a tat far ;a
one- or two-semester graduate course. Thus, in addltion to these new topics, we have
also inctuded the basic body of methodology found In otder texts, such as perturbation
theory, Green's function techniques, and the Landau theory of k r m i liquids.

PREFACE

Our pedagogical objective Is to convey the essentfat Ideas and to prepare the
student to read and understand the relevant research lterature. VVt? have attempt&
to p r e ~ n the
t formalism tersely, without undue emphasis on technical details and t o
show how it applies to a broad variety of interesting physlcat systems.
Homework problems are provided at the end of each chapter, and are crucial to
a thorough mastevy of the subject. Instructive alternative treatments of formal developments in the text are often presented as problems, as well as detaited caIcutations
which are too lengthy for the text. One model system, particles in one dimension
interacting via a &-function two-body potential, Is us& extensively to illustrate methods presented in the text, For this system, both exact sotutlons and a multitude of
common appraxlmations can be worktzcf out in detail analytically.
Finally, the organization of the book is as follows: We assume only an understancftng of elementary quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, so we begin in Chapter
f, with a thorough, self-contained treatment of second quantfzatian and coherent states.
Chapter 2 presents the general formalism of path integrals, perturbation theary and
its resummations, and non-perturbative approximations in the formally simple case of
the grand canonical ensemble at finite temperature, Specialization to zero temperature
and the canonical ensemble is discussed in Chapter 3. Chapter Iaddresses the role
of order parameters and braken symmetry in many-body theory and shows how mean
field theory embodies the essential physical content of the Landau theory of order
parameters and phase transitions, The next chapter develops the general properties
of Green" functions, and thdr application in describing fundamental excitation! and
physical observables, The phenomenotogical description and rnlcroscopic foundation of
the Landau theory of Fermi liquids a-re preanted in Chapter 6, Chapter 7 describes a
number of fu&her developments of functional integral techniques, including alternative
functional integral representations, the treatment of quantum mean field theory and
tunnefing decay, and the study of high orders of perturbation theory. The final chapter
presents stochastic methads.
As in all such eflFafls, we arc?indebted to many people far thdr Fnvaluahte assistance
in writing this book. This book was originally stimulatd by Davld Pines and benefited
from the editorial guidance of Rkk Mixter and Allan Wytde. Although it is impossible
to fist at1 of the teachers, coHeagues, and students whose insights have contributed
to t h h work, we would particulady like to acknowledge the contributions of Re Balian,

CHAPTER 1
SECOND QUANTIZATION AND COHERENT STATES
The quantum mechanics of a single particle is usually formulated in terms of the
position operator 2 and the momentum operator fi, All other operators of physical
interest may be expresd in terms of these operators, and a natural representation for
quantum mechanics, the coordinate representation, is defined f n terms of eigenfunctions of the position operstor, In this chapter, an analogous formalism is developed
for systems composrtsl of many idenlcical particles. For these systems it is useful to
define operators which create or annihilate a partkclie in specified states. Operators of
physical Interest may be expressed in terms of these creatlon and annihilation operators, in which case they are said to be expressed in "second quantizedfYorm, The
eigenstates of the annihilation operators are coherent states. A natural representation
for the quantum meichanics of many-particle systems, the holomorphic representation.
is defined Sn terms of these coherent states,
As a prelude to the formaflsm for many-particle systems, it is useful to begin by
reviewing some elementary aspects of quantum mechanics,

Quantum mechanks descdbes the state af a particle by a state vector
which
belongs to a H i f b e ~space U. This WlfbePt space U is the vector space of complex,
square: integrable functions, defined In configuration space, Using Dirac notation, the
scalar product of vectors in U is:

Then by definition, a vector 14) belongs to the Xilbert space K if the norm of 14) is
finite:

Atthough these vectors do not belong to )C, because their- norm i s not finite, they span
the whole Hilbert space U. This is reflected by the following closure relations:

SECOND QUANTIZATIOM A N 0 COHERENT STATES

1.2 SYSTEMS OF IDEHTCCAL PARTCCLES
The Hilbert space of states for a system of N identical partides is the space
of
complex, square integrable functions. defind in the configuration spa= of the N padcites. The wave function +N(i?l,h,

for finding particles at the N positions Pl, F'%, FM, must satisfy the condition:

As we have defined it, the Wllbert, spaw h is dmply the Nth tensor product of
the single-particle Hilberl space X :

corrstructect from the tensor poducts:

Note for future reference that the states defined in this way utilize a c u w d bracket in
the ket symbol. These basis states have the wave ftlnctions:

The overtap of two vectars of the basis is given by:

and the completeness of the basis is obtained from the tensor product of the completeness relation far the basis { (a)):

where I now represents tke unit operator in h.Physjcally, it is clear that the space
XN is generated by linear combinations of products of singfe-particle wave functions.
Thus far. in defining the Hilbert space RN. we have not taken into account the
symmetry property of the wave function. In contrast to the multitude of pure and mixed
symmetry states one could define mathematically, only totally symmetric and antisymmetric states are otrsemed in nature, Particles occurring Sn symmetric or antisymmetric
states are called Bosons and Fermions respectivefy,
The wave functlon of 1V Bosons is totally symmetric and thus satisfies

Creation and annihitation operators provlde a conwnient representation of the
many-pafticle states and many-body operators introduced in the preceding sections.
These operators generate the entire Wilbert space by their action on a single reference
state and pravlde a basis fau the algebra of operators of the Nilbert space.
For each singleparticle state [X) of the single-particle space U, we define a Boson

we have previously denoted other operators by a circumflex. 6, since the symbols a
and at wilt be reserved exclusively for creation and annihilathon operators, no circumflm
will be used. Physically the operator a: adds a particle in state IX) to the state on
which it operates, and symmetfizes or antisyrnmetrltes the new state. tn the case of
Fermions, since there can be at most one Fermion in a given state, Eq. (1-63b) takes

In the foliowing, to avoid a distfnctiofi between Bosons and Fermfans, we shalt use Eq.
(i.631"
tn addition to the many-papticle states we have umd thus far, it is u d u t to define
the vacuum state, denotrta 10). which represents a state with zero particles. A natural

The vacuum state 10) i s a physical state with no particles, and must be distinguished

excited state whkch can emit a photon. The fnitiat state of the system Ts a dfret
product of the excited atomic state and the photon vacuum, After d ~ a y the

a product of the final atomic state and a one-photan state.
The creation operators a1 do not operate within one space 8, or Fa,but rather
operate fram any space 8,. or F, to

Thus far we have used permanents or Slater determinants as a natural basls for
the Fock space B or 7, Another ctxtremely useful basis of the Fock space is the basis
of coherent states which is analogous to the basis of position dgenstatcs in quantum
mechanics. Although this is not an orthonormal basis, it spas!
the whole Fock space.
Just as the position states I'it) are defined as eigenstates of 7,the coherent states are
defind as eigenstates of the annihilation operators.
To see why annihilation operators are selected rather than creation operators.
it is usdui t o consider the dstcnca! sf dgenstates of the: crestton and annlhitation
operators. If we denote by 14) a general vector of the Fock space. we can expand 14)
as:

Thus,14) necessarily has a component with a mtnimum number of paeicles and 'rf we
apply any creation operator t o 14). we see that the minimum number of particles in 14)
is increased by onee Thus, the resulting state cannot be; a multiple of the orig;inal state
and therdore a creation operator cannot have an dgenstate. QR the other hand, i f we
apply an annihilation operator to (4). this decreases the maximum number of partides
in 14) by one, since 14) may contain components with all particle numbers, nothing a

space. that is, the fact that any vector of the Fock space can be expanded in terms of
coherent states. This is expressed by the closure relation

where 1is the unit operator i n the Fock space, the measure is given by:

and the integration extends over aft values of Re& and h#,.
As explained in Problem 1.2, one may verify Eq. (1.123) straightforwardly by
integrating the left hand side t o obtain the familiar completeness refation Eq. (1.51).
A more economical proof is provided by Schur's lemma, which in the present context
states that i f an operator commutes with all creation and annihilation operators, it is
proportional t o the unit operator in the Fock space. Using equations (1.120).

so that evaluating the commutator of Eq. (1.123) and integrating by parts,

By taking the adjoint of Eq. (1.126). we obsem that the left hand side of Eq. (1.123)
commutes with all the creation operators as well as the annihilation operators so it
must be proportionaf to the unit operator. The proportionality factor is calculated by
taking the expectation value of the left hand side of (1.123) in the vacuum:

This proves Eq. (1.123).

This completeness relation provides a useful expression for the trace of an operator. Let A be any operator and let (In > 1 denote a complete set of states. Then

In quantum mechanics. the completeness d the position eigenstates allows us to
represent a state I+) = dz*(z)lz) where +(z) = (%l$) is the coordinate representation of the state l$) Analogously, Equation (1.124) implies that any state I$) of the

Just as it is US&^ to know how the operators % and j3 act in coordinate repreentation, it is useful to exhibit how the operators o i and a, act in the coherent state

FERMION COHERENT STATES
ff we try to construct coherent states for Fermions, we immediatety encounter
the difficulty that if we expand them according to [f .114), the coefficients must be
Grassmann numbers. Therefore, in order to construct coherent states, we must enlarge
the Fermion Fock space.
We first define a Grsssmsnn algebra g by associating a generato! E, with each
annihilation operator a.. and a generator
with each creation operator.:a We then
construct the generaftzed Fock space as the set of linear combinations of states of the
Fock space 7 with coefficients in the Grassmann algebra 9. Any vector I$)in the
genefatired Fock space can be expanded as:

where the X , are Grassrnann numbers and the It$,) vectors of the h c k space.
In order to treat expressions containing combinations of Grassrnann variables and
creation and annihilation operators. it is necessary to augment the definition of the
Grassmann variables to specify the commutation relations between c's and a's and
the adjoints of mixed expressions. To obtain results analogous to those obtained
previously for Bosons, it is natural and convenient to require that

(1.1591 reproduces each non-vanishing term of the expansion of the exponential in the
first line. Although the coherent state belongs to the generalized Fock space and not
to 7. as we shall see, the crucial point is that any physical Fermion state of 7 can be
expanded in terms of these coherent states.
We now vedfy that coherent states as defined in (1.159) are eigenstates of the
annlhilation operators. For a single state a. the anticommutation relations of a,,a&,

However, in contrast to the Boson case, the expectation vahe of the number
operator is not a real number:

and it is meaningless to speak about the average number of particles in a Fermion
coherent state.
Finally, we conclude this section by contrasting the physical significance of Boson
and krmlon coherent states. Boson coherent states are the physical states which
emerge naturally when taking the classical limit of quantum mechanics or of a quantum
field theory (See Problem 1.5). In the classical limit. when the field operators are
assumed to eommute, the definition of a dasoicat field #(S) at each point of space is
identical to saying that the system is in the coherent state
= eldai9(')*t(')[0).
for example, a classical electromagnetic fieM can be v b w d as a coherent state of
photons,
In contrast, b m i o n coherent states are not contained In the hrmion k c k space,
they are not physically ob~wable,and there are no classlcat fields of krmions, Nevertheless, hrmfon coherent states are very u d u l in formally unifying many-brmfon
and many-Boson problems, and we shall use this propefiy extensively In the fatlowtng
e hapters,
tn the subsequent development, this physical diference wilt give rise to some significant differences in the treatment of flosons and Fermions. For example, application

from Eq. (1.182) by the appearance of the determinant in the numerator instead of
the denominator, Ta prove this identity, we need to deriw two additional resules for

the denominator as for cornpiex variables.
In order to transform Eq. (1.184) into diagonal form, we need to derive the law

Problems 6-8 d e d with the physics of the Hartree Fock approximation. It is a%.
sumed that students have been exposed to the conventional treatment of the Hartree
Fock and Fenni gas approximations in elementary quantum mechanics courses, so
these topics are not repeated in the text, However, this mean-field physics is fundamental to all the subsequent physical applications, so it is optimal to have it
clearly in mind before proceeding to the general formalism. Fox those unfamiliar

two-body operators provided in this chapter.
Problem 9 is particularly important because it introduces the problem of particles interacting in one spatial dimension with 6-function forces. Most of the methods
developed in later chapters may be worked out analytically for this system, so it
is essential to explore the elementary properties developed here as a foundation for
subsequent applications.

CHAPTER 2
GENERAL FORMALISM AT FINITE TEMPERATURE

The ultimate objective of the quantum theoq of many-particle systems is to
understand experimental!y observable prope&ies of a divgrse range of physical systems,
Techniques will eventuafly be present& which are suitable for small finite systems as
wet! as extensive macroscopic systems, for obsenrables in isolated systems at zero
temperature as well as finite-temperature systems. Once the appropriate theoretical
groundwork has Been established, specific experimental observabfes in a variety af
systems will be treated fn detail.
The "rtent of the present chapter, hswever, Es to present the essence of the generaf
theow in the particularly simple and convenient case of systems at finite temperature
whlclil may be treated On the grand canonical ensemble, To place the subsequent
formalism in proper persppeetlve, quantum statistical mwhanics is reviewed, the obsemables and response functions accessible experimentally are summarized, and the
general strategy of systematic apprexlmations is discussed. Eeynman path integrals are
presented and funetionat integral techniques are developed for the many-body problem.
Perlurbation theory is derived and detailed rules are presented for Feynman diagrams.
Finally, generating functions are derived for Green" Functi~nsand irreducible diagrams,
and the statjionarjr-phase approximation is applied t o the functional integral,

QUANTUM STATISTICAL MECHANICS
In quantum statistical mechanics, the themodynamic properLies of a system in
equilibrium are specified by the assumption of the equal occupation of accessible states.
The physical problem is Idealized by considering an appropriate enwmblle of identical
systems, and the probability of observing a particular state is given by the ratio of the
number of qstems in the ensemble in that state to the total number of systems in the
ensemble,
Three ensembles are commonly used. Tha microcanonleat ensemble describes an
isolatd system, which has fixed energy E and fixed particle number, The probability
of obsenring a state of energy E' $ E is zero and that of observing a state of energy
E' =. E Is constant, q u a l to the Inverse of the total number of states of energy E,
The canonical ensemble dexrbes a system of fixed particle number in equll'tbrium with
a thermal reservoir with which it may exchange enera at a spmlfied temperature. By
enumerating the number of states in which the system and the reemair combined have
a f i x d total energy, it follows that the probaMlity oaf obsewfng this ;t;ystem alone with
energy E is proportional to e- ft where k is Boltzmann's constant. The average energy
of the system is fixed and is, controlled by the temperature T. The grand canonical
ensemble describes a system in equitibviurn with a particle resemoir, with which it may
%change particles, as well as a thermal resewoir, Enumeration of the states in which
the system and resenroir have fixed total energy and pal-tkcle number leads to the result

APPROXIMATION STRATEGIES

of mathematical rigor ane can actually expwt and how fn practice one may select and
assess an appwimation scheme.
The most familiar systematic approximation scheme from elementary quantum
mechanfcs is perturbation theory, lt Is based an the bellef that the behavior of a
physkcal system Ts continuous "t same "smaltl" parameter describing the digerence
beween a sotvable problem and the actual system. It is crucial to note, hwever,
that in general perlurbatian theary yields an asymptotic rather than convergent series.
Under appropriate circomstances, it may yield a useful physical approximation, but It
cannot be applld systematicalfy to abritraw precision*

We will sub*quently st3e that this intarat is highly sugp;estiw of the path integral
desuibing the quantum mechanics of a particle In the s m e potential, E'lepending
on the signs of the quadratic and quafiic terms, the potential has three regimes of
qualitatively digereat behavior sketched in Fig, 2.1
Physically, the clasdcal or quantum behavior in this potential changes completely
when 9 changes sign, since a pafliticle is localized in (a) and not in (h). Thus. we expect
that the theory is nonanafytfc at g = Q and that an =pansion in powers of g has zero
radius of convergence. This physical behavior is reflected in the integral Z(g) which
diverges far g a O and 75 thus non-analytic at g = Q.
The perturbation series for Z(g) is easily obtained by expanding c - f s 4 , with the
result

where the asymptotic behavlor in the tast tine is obtained using Stirling's formula
n! = atik"+*e-rr. Since Z
, grows like n!, the sedes diverges as expected from
the non-analyticfty at g = 0, Later on when we think In terms of dhagrams, we will
understand the growth of Z,,in terms of the proliferation of the number of diagrams
with increasing order and the factor (h-l)!!'In the present example which m w h e f m s
the factor
will be recognized as the number of diagrams generated in performing
the Gaussian Integral of z4"using Wick's theorem.
The crucial point for our present disicussion is the fact that, under appropriate
circumstances, a finite number of terms of an asymptot"te series may give an excellent
approximation. The residual error after n terms Is bounded by the (n 1)""tem

so the approximation continues to improve as long as gmZmdecreases. Figure 2.2

and occurs at larger values of n so that at g == .01, for example, one attains the

perturbation expansions, loop expansions araund stationary solutions, approximations
in terms of solftons or "Istantone, and stochsstic approximations, Before proceedkg
to the general ease of many-gartkcle systems, it Ss instructive to illustrate the essential
idea with hynmtln path Integrals, The essence of the path integraf was Introduced in
a germinal paper by P,A,M, Blrac (1933) and developed exlensively by R P . kynman
(1948,1949,1950). All these historic papers are published in the reprint volume edited

A natural approximation to the path integraf, Eq, (2.41) In the limit as h -+ O is
the stationary-phase approximation. As will be shown in detail In S ~ t i o n(2.51, the
dominant contributfon to the transition amplitude in this lm"r tames from trajectories
surrounding the classical trajectory joining S$ to sg Finally, since the measure in Eq.

The functional integrai in Eq, (2.41) is cat!& the Lagrangian form and requires
that the HamittonOan have quadratic momentum dependence as in Eq, (2.32). The
Wamiltonian form af the functional integral is obtained by substituting Eq. (2.37) in
Eq, (2.30) without pedorming the p integration, in which case the matdx etement of
the evolution operator becomes

The trajectories z(t) obey the same boundary conditions as in the Lagrangian fDrm

Thus, although there is no expticlt indication in the notation that oprators have been
time-ordered, in order for the operators Ol(B, tl), Q%(&,t z ) , and &[g) t o be replaced
by the c-numkrs &(s(gl)), &(z(ta)), and Hip@),z(l)], it is implicit in the construcLion of the functional integral that each operatw had to act on the complete set of
states introduced at the corresponding discrete time. Operators depending upon the
momentum are treat4 in the same way by letting them act an the complete set of
momentum states introduced at the corresponding time. The fact that functional integrals necessarily yield time-ordered products is the reason for the asse~ionin Section
2.1 that tfme-ordered products are the quantities which arise naturally in the formalism and that physical response functions should ultimately be evaluated in terms of
them, From the definition of the time-ordered exponential, Eq, (2.9), and the path Integral, it is evuent that both quantities deal with the non-eommutatfv~@of operatars

terms of a coherent state path int;egrai. It is usdul to give the creation and annihltat'ron
operators a formal 7 label.{ai (r),a, ( r ) ) ,denoting the time slice r upon which they are
defined, This purely formal 7 label Ss introduced to allow the time-ordering operator to
approprktety Interlace operators with no explicit .r-dependence, and when the evoluthn
operator is repre~ntedby a functional integral, the operators {aL(r),o,(r)] on the
time slice P wfll be replaced by the coherent state variables ($z(r),$,(r)). To fslcilitate

As preparation for the generat case of a many-body Hamittonian, it Is u d u f to

By the symmetry of the matrix element, Eq. (2,1011) the value of the diagram '?l equals
that of .'l For a diagram with n interactions there are
exchanges which yield the
same value, Note that tsxtremity =change symmetry cowesponds to interchanging
the spatial integration variables in a potential matrix element such as Eg. (1.109). ro
that all the transformations Ieaving a Iabeled kynman diagram Invariant correspond
to permutations of spatial or time variables of integration.
The most general transformatton which leaves the value of a labded dlagram
invariant is a combinatisn of a permutatlon of the time labels and an exchange of
vertm ~tremities, Some such transformations acting on a given diagmm generate
distinct diagrams while others simply generate deformations of the adginat diagram
whkh must not be counted as dfstlnct diagrams. Thus, the combinatorial task facing
us is to calculate the number of distinct diagrams which have the same value sa that
we can multiply this number by the value of any one such diagram.
To this end, we note that the set of transformations af an nth ordet diagram
generated by any permutatlon of the time labels and any exchange of extremities of
ve~lcesis a group, which we will denote by G, and has grin! elements, Condder
the action af this group of transformations, G , on a labeid diagram l?, Some set of
transformations GP will transform L" fnta a deformation of itself and the rest of the
trangormations wOIl yield diagrams which are distfnct from F. The set Gr defined in
this way is a subgroup of G.
We define the symmetrjl factor 5 of the dhgram as the number of dc3fornations
of ]I" generat& by the action of 6, Ely the definition of Gr,S is the number of
demerits of Gr and since Gr is a subgroup of G, S is a divisor of 2nn!. Now
condder a graph I"' distinct from E" which 5s obtained from I' by a transformation in G.
Since I" ccorresponds to some permutation of the 7 and ILR labels on I', it transforms
into a dekmatlon of itsdf under Gip and S of the remahing graphs are therefore
deformations of.''l Continuing in this way by selecting a graph distinct from all the
previous graphs and identifying its S deformations, the sRnr! diagrams generated by
G acting on l? can be grouped into
sets of S diagrams, such that the diagrams
in each set are deformations of each other and diagrams in dierent sets are distinct.
We therefore conclude that the group G of tranzformations which leave the value of
a labeled diagram invariant generates exactly
distinct diagrams with the same
value. AI1 dfstinct diagrams will thus be e o r r ~ t l ycounted i f we take the value of one

In swond order, whereas there are 24 labreled dlagrams and eight unlabeld Feynman diagrams, there are three Hugenholtz diagrams. The diagram

corresponds to the two unlabeled Feynman diagrams G and H of Fig. (2.4). It has
two quivalent pairs and the symmetqy factor is 2 since interchange of the upper

Thus, each interaction consewes momentum, with the Kronctcker 6 rqulring that the
sum of the momenta of propagators entefing the vertex equal the sum of the rnomenta
leaving the vertex, and carries a factor of f.
Every dtagram can be decomposed into connect4 parts, that is parts in which
an uninterruptd chain of propagators connects any vertex to any other vertex, For
example in Figg,23, diagram A has three connected parts, diagrams B and C have two
cionneaed parts, and diagrams D through H have one connect4 paut.
The diagram rules for a connwted diagram with m interactions give rise to the
following contributions, There wlll be 2m propagators gb,(q - q f , each summed
independently over a complete set of momentum states k,. The m interactions will
give rlse ta the product of m momemtum-cansewing Kronecker S's and a factor of
V"? Since the diagram 5s linked and momentum Ss consewed at each ve@c?x,one
of the m Kronecker 6's is redundant. Thus, there are (m - 1) constraints on the 2m
momenta for the propagator, leading to a sum over (m+ 1) independent momenta, In
the contfnuum limit, each sum over an independent mometum is reptaced by an integral
F(k,) -,
dSkF(L). Combining the factor Vm+' from these independent
momentum integrals with the fac'tsr V""" fmm the m matrix elements thus yfetds

remaining possiblilky, then, is to permute times beween loops, However, since In the
case of the diagram (2.1142aj the sub-diagrams cannected to the left and right sides
of the R-vertex are tapoIogicafly inequivalent, none af these permutations produce a
deformixtbn.
The following diagram is an example in which exchanging times between digerent

Note that the subdiagram conniected to the left side of the R-vet-tex is topologkdy
equivalent to that connected to the right dde. Interchanging 71 with
and TS with
re and simuftanwusfy interchanging the extremities of att the vefiiees thus yields a
deformation of the orkginal diagrams as shown a t the right, This simultaneous extremity exchange and exchange of all! the times in the topologically equivalent subdiagmms
connected to the R-vertex is in fact the on!y operation which can produce a deformation of the diagram, We have seen that no other operations which change time labels
produce delormations. and by anaiyzlng the L-W labels in each closed propagator loop
of a general diagram, one can also see that pure extremity exchange without time permuations can never produce a deformation. Thus. the symmetry factor for diagram

has symmetry factor S = 2 because of the time and extremity permutatfuns shown at

The general rule for the symmdry factor rmulting from this analysis Is simple. For

In contrast to a diagram for a threebody operator. where the ppagators entering

The analysis is similar to that far the expectation value ( R ) . In the present case, because there 1s no fredom to exchange propagators at the external points, there are no
permutaions involving the times along the three propagators starting and terminating
at these external points whkh can produce a deformation. Since these times are now
uniquely fixed, propagator loops connected to these lines by interaction verlices in turn

Eq. (2,1505) for W and the 7 arguments of $, and J, have been suppressed for
compactness,
Instead of dmltng with the generating function W as a function of the sources
J* ,J ,it is useful to perform a Legendre transformation to obtain a function of the fields
$*, 4. The motivation for performing this transfermation Is evident from considering
the familiar example of a spin system in a magndc field, which will be treated in detail
in Chapter 4. Denoting the Hamittonian of the spin wadable as X ( & ) , the free energy
as a function of an external magnetic field .@ is given by

from whlch it follows that the magnetization is given by

A state function which depends upon the magnetization Instead of the externat magnetic field is obtained by inverting the datlon (2.16ib) to obtain H ( M ) and defining
the Legendre transform

It follows that G satisfies the rwiprocity relation

Whereas both P(W) and G ( M ) contafn the same physical information, in the case
of the first-order ferromagnetic phase transition, G ( N ) has bater analytic properties
and wilt thus be preferable ta approximate. Below the critical temperature, since M is
non-vanishing and has the same sign as H , equation (2.161b) implies that P ( H ) has
non-zero posttive slope for positive H and a non-zero negative slope for ~egativeH $so
that it has a cusp at the ori@n. In contrast, G ( M ) is a smooth daubte well, anti the
discontinuity associated with the First-order phase transition arises from moving from
the solution to Eq. (2.163) in one welt t o the solution in the second welt.
In the case of the generating function W[Jz(r), J,(t)]. the equations (2.160)for

CHAPTER 3
PERTURBATION THEORY AT ZERO TEMPERATURE
In this chapter, the general Formarism introduced in Chapter 2 for the grand canonical ensemble at finite temperature is specialized t o systems of fixed particle number
at zero temperature, The coherent state functiona[f integral formafism may be applied
directly i n this special case by rqlacing the trace occurring in the partition function by
the expectation value in a non-interacting ground state, The methodology of enumerating all contractions with Feynman dhagrams is unchanged, and the diagram rules are
modified only by simple changes in the propagators and associated Factors,
VVe begin by expressing phydcal observables in terms of matrk elements in the
non-interacthng ground state which are strictly analogous to corresponding finite temperature traces in Chapter 2 and which may then be evaluated in perturbation theory
using Wick's theorem. As a preliminary step, propagators for the zero-temperature
expansion are first evaluated in the zero-particle vacuum, and the result i s then applied
t o a many-Fermion system by transforming t a particle and hole operators defined relative t o the non-interacting ground stale, Given the perturbation theory for Fermions,
8osons may be treated directly by introducing a formal spin variable with spin degttneracy equal to the particle number, so that restricting the non-interacting ground state
t o be an antisymmetric singiet state i n this variable renders the overall wave functbon
symmetric in the physical variables, In subsequent sections, time-ordered Goldstone
diagrams will be introduced and the zero-temperature limit will be discussed.

3.1 FEVNMAN DIAGRAMS
The finite temperature diagram expansion was obtained by expressing the abservables of interest in terms of thermal averages of operators. Eq. (2.80b).

where all operators including those in
have a formal label r denoting the
and .l@
time slice upon which they are defined. Expressing the thermal average by the equiva) a series of

(2,145) where the thermal average has been replaced by an appropriate expectation
value, Let us begin with the ground state energy and denate the eigenvalues and

damped and the desired ground state energy may be obtained.
To recast Eq. (3.3) into a form analogous to Eq. (3.1). and t o prepare for the
subsequent treatment of Green's functions, it is useful to select a contaur from -+To
to 5% in the complex E-plane. Let the distance from -$Tot o $ !Eo along this contour
be specified by a real variable g. The time-ordered product for a set of operators
having times on the contour is then defined by ordering the operator in terns of
increasing and a path integral is defined by breaking i into arbitrarily small intervals
and introducing a complete set of states at each slice in the usual way. There is
considerable freedom in choosing the contour, since by analytkity the result will be
independent of the shape of the contour and the only requirement on To is that its
imaginary part must ultimately ga to --W, One passible contaur is G,shown in Fig.
3.1, corresponding to the imaginaq time used in Chapter 2, For our present purposes,

140

PERTURBATION THEORY A T ZERO TEMPERATURE

however, it is preferable to use the contour C2, which is rotated by an arbitrariiy smafl
angle 6 relative to the real axis and may be expressed in terms of a real variable f as

In addition t o reproducing the familbr results from conventional derivations in real
time, this choice also enables us to treat real-time Green" functions without the need
for explicit analytic continuation. Throughout this chapter the time variable t w"t\ be
understood t o be on the contour C2and the -ie factor wiil only be included explicitly
when necessary.
With this preparation, we now define the following ground state average specified
by .Howhich is the zero-temperature anaiog of Eq. (3.1)

As before, it is cruciaf to note that T time orders along C2 all the operators in E" as
well as interleaving them with the operators in B0(aL(t),a,(t)). Note that H. enters
the definition implicitly through the fact that .HO
defines IQa), as well as explicitfy.
Using this definition, Eq. (3.3) may be rewritten "t the following farm

and one integral over absolute time which yields a factor G. Physicalty, ground state
Feynman diagrams are always of finite time extent because they represent time histories of virtual excitations which by the energy-time uncertainty principle, can onty be
sustained for limited times.
In the same way. expectation values of operator and Green's functions may be
expressed in forms strictly analogous t o the finite temperature results in Chapter 2.

The left-hand sides of Eqs, (3.7) and (3.8) are of the form of Eqs, (2.238) and

all linked diagrams containing the operators R or a,,(tl). .ai,m(tz,). Thus, all

the same diagram expansions h real time by considering the evolution operator for a
Hamiltonian H,(t) = .Ho+ c - c i t I ~ in which the interaction V is adiabatically turned oR
a t large positive and negative times. As outlined in Problem (3.11, a theorem by GellMann and l o w (1951)shows how to obtain an dgenstate of the interacting system
by applying the evolution operator for H E ( $ )to an eigenstate of the non-interacting
system and taking the limit as e --, 0,from which observables may be evaluated
straightforwardly.

PERTURBATION THEORY A T ZERO TEMPERATURE

Note that since normal-ordered operators have creation operators represented by a
coherent state one time step later than the annihilation operator, as in Section 2.2, an
infinitesimal q" has been introduced in Eq, (3.15) to emphasize that the result vanishes
at equal time. The fact that the propagator (3.15) is non-vanishkg only for positive
times (t t') whereas the thermodynamic propagator (2.78) has components for both
positive and negative times arises divectly from the digerence betMleen the boundary
conditions

conditions $(p) = -+(Q) in the finite temperature case. One also observes in Eq.
(3.15) an example of the general feature that the imaginary part in Eq. (3.2b) defining
the contour 0%makes the propagator converge at large values of Jt- t'l. Physically.
Eq. (3.15) for the non-interacting Green's function is obvious. For t > t'. a: creates

. The general expansion is obtained by enumerating the diagrams
connecting all four kinds of vertices and a simple special case is treated in Problem

(3.3).
A second alternative which is simpler and more general is ta make the Bason
problem into an equivalent Fermion problem by introducing a formal spin variable with
spin degeneracy equal to the particle number (Gentile, 1940, 1942: Brandsw, 1971).
This method has the advantage that it is valid for any pau-licfe number, does not involve
the bookkeeping associated with four diEerent interaction vertkes. and involves only
trivial modifications of the Fermion rules derived in the previous stzcthn,
To avoid confusion with the physical spin and t o make the language more cotorful,
Iet us call the format spin variable cotor. Each physical single-particle state now has
N degenerate substates with different color projections, We now treat this augmented
problem, with both physlcal and cotor variables, as a many-fermion problem and use
zero-temperature perturbation theory to find the totally antisymmetric ground state.
The non-interacting ground state, Go, is a determinant with all particles in the lowest

assumption, that c - ' ~ ~ [ @yields

is a reflection of the ever present assumption that we have selected a non-interacting
ground state which is not orthogonal to the true ground state,
The Boson diagram rules are extremely simple. Each propagator is summed over
physical single-particle labels and over cotor projections. Since H contains the diagonal
unit operator in cofor space, there can be no cotor flips and the color projections must
be the same for all Ferrnion propagators comprising a closed toop. When propagators
are summed over aft physical quantum numbers and cofor prdectisns, each closed
propagator thus acquires a factor of N and there Is no other remnant of the artificial
color vrtdabtes, Since the non-interacting Boson ground state has only a single physical
orbital occupied, the sum ovtfr M occupied orbitals {A) for Fermions is replaced by
a single occupled orbital which we shall denote by (0). The sum aver unoccupied
orbitals is denoted as a sum over an infinite set of labels (a) as for Fermions, Thus,
there are only two changes relative to Fermlons: each closed toop contributes a factor
N and the sum over occupied states (A) Is replaced by a single state (0).
Several comments are useful concrtrning the N-dependence and signs. Direct and
exchange graphs now d i h r by a factor of N. For example, the Mavtree-Fock diagrams,
Eq. 13.27) now yield

For an infinite system in the thermodynamic lim"rt, the overall N dependence
must be determined by considering the volume dependence as well as the formal Ilf
dependence. Each interaction vertex contributes a factor
as before. so the Hartree

To illustrate these rules and tlo show how several time-ordered graphs reproduce

provides the result more economkczllly than the sequence of frequency Integrals required

intermediate state with two holes and one particle (in addition t o d and b) represented
by the following diagrams:

As shown in Problem 3.10, each term is evaluated as in Eq. f3.12a) and the sum of
the five resulting terms yields the self-energy,

PERTURSATION THEORY AT Z E R O TEMPERATURE

The overall minus sign relative to Eq. (3.58b) results from the additional hole line, The
direct term agah agrees with Eq, (3.39b) and this case illustrates how a general class
of topologicalfy 'identical time-ordered dkgrams combine to give a simple result,
Whereas most of the diagrams appearing in the Goldstone expansion have the
direct physkaal interpretation of enumerating a time histow of the N-particle system,
several special cases arise which merit comment. One case is the presence of diagrams
which appear to violate the Pauli principle, Although there is a temptation to eliminate
such graphs on physical grounds, our dedvation shows that they must be included,
Their role i s easily understood by considering the following pair of linked and unlinked
graphs which have a propagator for state a appearhng twice at the same time:

Because the right-hand graph has an additknal loop relative; to the left-hand graph
and all matvix elements and denominators are identical, the two contributions t o
cancel identically and there is no mistake. Since the exponential of
(@trole-"aT@l@,)
the sum of all linked dlagrams necessau'rly generates all possible unlinked diagrams irrespective of labels, including the right-hand graph in 13.60).it is essential to retain the
left-hand graph to preserve the physical cancellation. Similarly, there exist canceling
pairs of graphs such as the following

far whkh the linked partner has no physical meaning. Qnce a particle has been scattered out of an occupied state A into an unoccupied state a, it Is impassible to haw
a subsequent interaction involving state A corresponding to the left-hand diagram.
However, this lrnphysicail contribution exactly cancels the unlhked Pauli violating diagram on the right, and by the preceding argument, must be retained. Note that no
corresponding cancellation arises if A in the left-hand graph is replaced by a particle
line, since closed toops beginning and ending at the same vertex as in the rlght-hand
graph are necessarily hate lines. These special cases only arise far graphs involving
for large systems. For very
duplicate labels which occur with relative probability
small systems, where a large fraction of the graphs are in some sense unphysical,
there is no particular advantage t o usbng the linked cluster expansion, and it may be
preferable to use Buillouin Wigner perturbation theory or same other formatism which
is not deliberately rearranged according to paeicfe number.
Goldstone diagrams provide a convenient framework for physicalty motivated re
summations of diagrams. The first resummation we consider here corresponds to the
independent particle or mean-field approximation, The use of the Hartree-Fock basis to
include the average effect of at! the other particles has already been discussed in Problem 1.6 and in Chapter 2 in connection with the use of the Hartree-Eock self-eneru to
define single particle propagators, In terms of diagrams, it is convenient to decompose
H into H. = T ( I H F and V = CijV ( Z { zj)- UHF and to enumerate all diagrams

Thus, use of the Martree Fock potential pePfarms an infinite summation of all possSble
insertions of the WarEree-Fack self-energy in propagators

and includes the physical effect of the mean fidd on the single particle wave functions
and propagatars.
Just as the independent-particle approx!mat'ron describes the propagation of a
single p a ~ i c l eby replacing its interaction with at! the other particles by the mean field,
the next resummathon corresponds to the independent pair apgroximatbn which treats
the two-body interaction between a pair of parllicles in the medium white replacing the
"Iteraction of the pair with aI1 other particles by the mean field. In terms of diagrams,
one sums all orders of ladder diagrams in which two interacting paPticles rescatter any
number of times in intermediate particle states (using Hartree-Fock propagators from
the previous resummation). Thus, Gofdstona diagrams are reexpressed in terms of the
Brueckner reaction matrix

which satisfies the integral equation

The hierarchy of resummations may be continued with the solution of the three-body
Bethe-Faddeev equation which, using single-parlicle Wartree-Fock propagators and twobody reaction matrix elements, sums all succc?ssiverescatterings af three particles in
intermediate partick states. Since time-ordered diagrams clearly separate pafiictes and
holes, this sequence of resummations gives rise ta an expansion ordered in the number
of hole lines. The hole-lhe expansion is use-ful in treating dense quantum liquids, such
as llquld Helium and nuclear matter.

PERTURBATIQN THEORY A T ZERO TEMPERATURE

3.3 THE ZERO-TEMPERATURE LIMIT
The objective of this final section is to compare the zero-temperature perturbation
theory derived in this chapter with the zero-temperature Ihmit of the finite temperature
theory of Chapter 2. Followhg the arguments of Kohn and tuttinger (1960).the
essential point is evident from considering the ground state energy for Fermions in the
lowest order of perturbation theory in which the two theories can diffw. A general
format proof may be found "I the work of Luttinger and Ward (1960).
At Finite temperature, the energy is given by E = n+pN+r"S, where the chemical
potential p must be adjusted such that N =
yieids the desired particle number.
Thus, we must compawe m

zero-temperature propagators with n, ..:f. or O and each zero-temperature graph for
- 6 corresponds to the zero-temperature limit of some finite-temperature graph
for Ct no,the two tsxpansions agree in most respects,
There are just two diRerences between the zero and finite temperature theories
which, for simplicity, we will discuss here for the case of translationally Invariant systerns:

1) The fSnite temperature expansion contains ( p - p o ) N where the chemical potential

2) The finite temperature expansion admits anamalous graphs such as

since we have assumed translational invariance throughout this section we will
label states by single-particfe momenta. At finke temperature, nk(l - na) does
not vanish at the Fermi surface whereas such anomalous graphs are never present

The h t u r e that. an anomalous diagram yields B(1 - nk)m is general since oppositely directed propagators of the same k yield the factors (1 - n k ) ( - n k ) with no
exponential so that integration over relative time yields an additional fador p. In the
zero-temperature limit, this factor yields

-

Hence, like the term IV(p m), anomalous diagrams produce S-functions which are
never satisftd for discrete r k . Therefore, For finite systems the T --, O limit agrees
with the zero-temperature expandon.
For infinite systems, we wish to compare finite and zero-temperature theories in
the thermodynamic limit, so we consider the double limit lhT4

In this
case both the anomalous diagrams and N I P - h ) are nan-vanishing, but as suggested
by the fact that bath terms yield the sane 6-function, it is possible that they may
cancel- The criterion for cancellation is easy to see in lowest order. &et us separate
the Grand potentbl into the following terms:

where the average of any function of k at the Fermi surface is defined by

and U denotes the Haeree-Fock potential, Eq, (3.65b).
The physical essence of the result, Eq. (3.10) is the relation between the symmetry
of the non-interacting zero-temperature ground state and the exact ground state, When
A = 0,both theories yield the physical ground state. When A < 0,the 2' -+Q limit
of the Plnlte-temperature theory yields the ground state whereas the zero temperature
theory produces an excited ctigenstate with some incorrect symmetry it has inherited
from the non-interacting ground state, Since A measures the fluctuations In II;, at the
unpe@urbed Fermi surface, it will vanish for a spherical Fermi surface and a HarltreeFock potential Uj, which depends only on I k 1. This will occur, for example, when
a is the kinetic energy or any single-particle energy depending on 1 k 1 and when
o(q 3)is a central potential, The cancellation has also been demonstrated far spin
112 particles interacting with tenmr forces.
The feature which can destroy the canceltation and produce ~egativeA is a digerence h the symmetry of the non-interacting problem, as reflected In the Fermi surface,
and the interacting problem, as reflected in U,A simple example is a system of spin112 particles in an external magnetic field. Taking .& as the kinetic energy, the Fermi
surface is two equal Fermi spheres for spin up and sph down. Repeating the derivation of Eq, (3.70)for a one-body perturbation -@Bog simply replaces U ( k ) by the
matrix element of the one-body operator, -pBm where m is the spin project'ran. In
this case, the vafiance of pEZm evaluated over the tvvo Fermi spheres with m = =1=Is

non-vanishing, This corresponds to the fact that the perturbation cannot flip spins so
there is no way t o get from the non-interacting state with tvvo equal Fermi spheres to
the true interacting graund state with unequal Fermi spheres, We wit! return t o this
=ample again in Chapter 5.
In conclusion, it is evident that the decompositian H. = T U, V = er U

ORDER PARAMETERS AND BROKEN SYMMETRY
One of the goats of many-body theory is to understand the phases in which
matter exists and the transitbons between these phases, This chapter addresses the
fundamental role of order parameters and symmetw breaking in characterizing phases
and understanding phase transitions.

To prepare for the subsequent quantitative treatment of order parameters, mean
field theoy, and fiuctuations, it is useful to review briefly several elementary aspects
of phase transitions.
PHASES OF TWO FAMILIAR SYSTEMS

A ferromagnetic material, such as iron, and a typkaaf substance having solid, fiquid,
and gas phases Illustrate the essential features of how the phase of a thermadyniamic
system changes as a function of the temperature and an external thermodynamic field.
In addition to the temperature and external field, it wZII be useful to characterize the
state of the system by a thermodynamic variable conjugate to the external field and
to study the surface of the equation of state in the space of three variables: the
temperature. the external field, and the canjugate variable,
The surface of the equation of state and phase diagrams for a ferromagnet are
shown in Fig. 4.1 The magnetic field
is the external field which together with the
temperature determine the state of the system, and the phase dhgram in the H - I'
plane is shown in the upper left of Fig, 4.Z. Betow the critical temperature G,the
system is spontaneously magnetized and the state of the system is characterized b~
the magnetization l@. the thermal average of the microscopic spins. If we choose X
to be along the B axis, these will be two ferrornagnetic shzltes at low temperature, the
f state for positive H and the 4 state for negative: H. These two states are separated
by a phase boundary, indicated by the soilid line, This p h a bounday
~
terminates at a
critical point C at temperature T,,and above the criticat point, the system has a single
paramagnetic phase. The system may either be brought from the ferromagnetk 4 phase
to the ferromagnetic f phase discontinuously, by selecting a path which crosses the
phase boundary, or cantinuously by choosing a path which travels around the critical
point into the paramagnetic phase,
The magnetization M is the thermodynamic variable conjugate to .H, and a more
complete characterization of the phases of the ferromagnet is provided by the surFace
of the equation of state In the space of M , H, and T sketched in the upper right of Fig.
4.1, The vertical shaded surl'itce denotes the region of phase coexistence separating
the 7 and ferromagnetic phases, Isotherms below the critical temperature: T<,at

depending upon the pressure, the materlaf can exist as a gas, liquid, or solid. At high
temperature, the liquid and gas phases become ind'rstinguishabte and the material has
a unique fluid phase, The liquid-gas phase bounday termhnats at the critical point
marked 6 , having critical temperature T, and pressure 8. In the present discussion,
we wilt be particufarty interested In the behavior in the vicinity of the critkcal point, and
its similarity to the prreceding example of the ferromagnet, The tiquld, gas, and fluid
phases are analogous to the ferrornagnetic ferromagnetic $ and the paramagnetic
phases respectively, and as in the prevbous case, it is possible to go continuously from
the gas to liquid phases by passing around the critical point through the fluid phase.
Arthough the thermodynamic variable conjugate to the field P is often chosen to
be the volume, the analogy to the magnetic: case is most: evident if we use the density
p as the conjugate variable (p = $ where v is the specific volume). The surface of
the equation of state in the space of p, P , and I" is shown in the upper right and
isotherms in the p - P plane are plotted in the tower right. Again, the vertical segment

A -- B of the isotherm Tx below the cdtical temperature represents the region of phase
coexistence, this time between gas and liquid. The projection onto the p I" plane in
the lower left yields a phase boundary near the critical point c analogous t o that already
observed for the magnetization as a function of temperature, and will subsequently lead
us to identify Pfiquid Pgaa as the order parameter.
Thus, the two surfaces of the equations of state in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2 show the same
essential behavior in the vicinity of the critical point, The magnetic case Is somewhat
simpler t o visualize because the coexistence region lies precisely In the M
2' plane
whereas the tlquid gas coexistence region is a cuwed surface, In both cases, below
the critical temperature a thermodynamic variable, M or p, varies discontinuously
across the coexistence surface as a function of the codugate field, H or P and the
discontinuity approaches zero at the critical point.
Since non-analytic behavior in thermodynamic wrlables such as ME, IT) is characteristic of phase transitions, It is usltfuf to note the possbble reasons for which the
c-*
could besum of analytic functions comprising the partition function Z =
come non-analytic, The energies Em could be non-analytic functions of the parameters
of the system as in the case of the quaelc oscillator in Section 2.t. The finite sum
over n could diverge as in the case of the hydrogen atom, Alternatively, non-analytidty
could arise from taking the zero temperature limit or from taking the thermodynamic
Iimit in which the number of degrees of freedom goes t o infinity, Except in special
cases, we shall see that the orkin of non-anafyticity its in fact the thermodynamic
limit.

PNEMQMENOLBGICAL LANaAU TWEQRV
Considerable insight into the structure of the general theory developed subsequently is provided by a purely phenomenological theory by Landau (Landau and Lifshitz, 1958). In this theory, an order parameter for a phase transition is defined as a
quantity which vanishes in one phase, called the disordered phase, and is non-zero in
the other phase, called the ordered phase, An order parameter may not exist for some
transitians, such as the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a two dhensional classical
spin system, and when it does exist, it is not unique (since any power also satis5es
the definition). For our present purpose, it wilt always be possible to choose the order
parameter t o be the thermodynamic average of an obsembte, We will also use the
Landau definition that a transition is first order if the order parameter Is discontinuous
at the transition point and scteond order if it is continuous,"
In the case of a ferromagnet. we observe from Fig. 4.1 that the magnetization-per
spin is an order parameter, We wilt use the convention that the totali magnetization M is
defined as the thermodynamic average of the spin and that 8%denotes the magnetization
per spin

The magnetization vanishes In the high-temperature paramagnetic phase, and the phase
transition is second order since m is continuous. The physical order in this case is the

The phenomenologirca! thwrg is based on the Landau function Lfm,H,T], a

The only physicaf constraint on the farm of l is that it be consistent with the
known symenetries of the system, One of the great accomplishments of this theory
is its description of the non-analytic behavior at phastt transitions in terms of the discantlnuous jumps fn the position of the absolute minimum of a function which is Itself
vaying continuously with T and H. Although we will eventually see a clear relation
between the Landau f'unction and an energy functional appearing in a functional Onlttgrat for the exact partition functjon, for the present let us simply see: how the observed

the Xeisenberg model is described by a four-dimensional suIf51ce which we wilt not

Because the order parameter m changes corrt!nuously at a seeond order phase

nelghborhood of the transition as a power series In m. To the w e n t to which only a

one may identify essentially universal behador shared by classes of diverse physical

In the present case, this expandon succinctly summarizes the essential features of Fig.
4.3, tn the case of crystals, with point group and translational symmetries and more
eompIicated order parameters, the Landau rule that the symmetry group of the tower
symmetry state must be a subgroup of the higher symmetry state for a second order
transition provides a powerful tool for identifying the invariants which may appear in
and thus characterize the possible phase transitions.
To avoid misunderstanding, it is important to distinguish the Landau function
from another function which also has the property that its minimum specifies the state
of the system. Recalf from the discussion in connection with Eqs, (2.262 2.163) that

At zero field, then. the state of the system is specified by the condition

when M is an order parameiter, I"(M) appears to satisfy the definition of the Landau
function, In generat, at finite field, one is tempted to consider the fcsftowlng function
as the Landau function

is no problem with this assoclatian. Below the critical point, however, there is an
essential digerence between the behavior of f and E which i s shown in Fig. 4.4 for

the zero field case (where

from the continuous double well of the phenomenologicat Landau function. Although,
by definition, it describes the phase transition exactly, it does not embody the essential
feature of the tandau function af describing a phase transition in terms of competing
minima of a continuously varying smooth function.

Atthaugh the Landau function for H = Q, 2"

spins, the system is invariant under global spin reflections Si --+ --gi and the tandau
function is a symmetric doubife welt possessing the same symmetry. However, each of
the two mlnima of the double well break the symmetry and transform into each other

with a continuous set of degenerate minima reflecting the symmetry with respect to
conthuous global spin rotations. The con6gurations corresponding to each of these
minima break the spin rotation symmetry and transform into one another under spin

SOnce the thermodynamic prope&ies of a majcroscopic magnetic system betow T",
are non-analytic at H = 0,some care is required In discussing the zero field properties.
On the one hand, phydcalty we know that the magnetic field of a ferrornagnet can point
in some spclcific direction. OR the other hand, the strict definition of a thermodynamic
atrerage as the sum over all states with the appropriate Boltzmann weights would

To avoid ambiguity, we shalt define the order parameter at zero field as the limit
of the order parameter In the presence of a weak external conjugate field as the field

We first consider the case of Ising spins, For an arbitrarily weak positive H,the
symmetry of the Landau function is broken and the minimum at positive M, denoted

unique solution M = 0. For infinite N.however, the behavior is non-analytic at H = Q
and one must define the state of the system by a specific path on the sudace of the
equatran of state as H -+ 0, Heuristlcatty, if we interpret the Landau function as the
free energy for the moment, because there is in some sense an infinite barder between
A and B, the system is not ergodic at H .= Q and may be trapped in ctither state A or
B depending on the histouy,
The s&uation can be stlgtrtly more campiicated in the case of continuous symmetry,
For z - y spins, the Landau function Is a surface wRh a minimmu corresponding to the

all the degenerate configurations can be accessed without having ta cross an infinite

configurations comespanding to all the orientations of fixed %( in three dimensions.
We wilt see that thermal fluctuations can excite collective Goldstone modes in whkh the
system samples degenerate configurations at the bottom of the valley, Dependkg on
the dfrnensionatity of the space and tensorial character of the order parameter, these
co!fective modes can either destroy the order by equally mixing alf the degenerate
phases, or have no effect on the order because their effect is suppressed by phase
space factors,

4.2 GENERAL FORMULATION WITH ORDER PARAMETERS
We now seek to formutate a general theory which in leading approximation enbodies the physics of the Landau function of the order parameter. Since the order
parameter fs singled out as the coltctctive variabte representing the essential degrees
of freedom governing phase transition, it Is natural to east the partition function in
the form of a functional integrai over the order parameter, and in the stationary phase
appraximation, the theory has precisely the tandau form. The corrections to the SPA
systematicatly correct the leading Landau contribution. To introduce the basic ideas,
we first present a simple illustrative model and then dkcuss the generat case,

INFINITE RANGE ISING MODEL
In order to relate the preceding discussion to the general theory involving a functional integral over an order parameter, it is instructive to consider an admittedly
artificial model, which has the important property that the stationary phase approximation is exact. In this model, each of the lsing spins

every other spin Si with an exchange energy -$. The scaling of the exchange energy
as $ in this model is required in order to have a thermodynamic limit. In the presence

The mode! prwides a concrete =ample of the need to define the zero field magnetization carefully as the limit in which an external field is turned off. Simply arguing
in terms of equal Bsltzmann weights, one would naively calculate the zwo field magnetization ts be

However, as we shall now see, introduction of an infinitesimal field H , which we

wilt assume t o be positive, lifts the degeneracy between the two phases and leads
to a unique absolute minimum of the Landau function. The stationarity condition
1.6 th p(H + pJ), Eq, (4.16b). is solved graphically for a small magnetk field in Fig.,
4.54.
Away from the criticat pdnt, uslng the definition of the zero field susceptibility,
the shift 6y away from the zero field solution
induced by a small field E is

So, as shown in Fig, 4.5, for T > T,, there Is only one solution, point Q, with
magnethation m = x o H , which goes to zero as H goes to zero. The minimum of the
tandau functional is displaced in the direction of H , tf T I", as shown in Fig, 4.5
there are three solutions: points A, B and Q'*
The solution 9'. corresponding to p ~ "t=
is again a maximum of the Landau
function and thus we must on!y consider the two phases A, corresponding t o f, and
B, corresponding t a 1. The magnetization of these phases is given by:

Thdr corresponding Landau function and Boltzrnan factors are gikn by

Thus, we see that the introduction of a smafl magnetic field Is sufFicient to lift the
degeneracy between the 1 and 4 phases, and that:

So, the probability far the system to be in a phase opposite to the magnetic fieid is
zero in the thermodynamic limit (as long as H does not go to zero as $ or faster)
and the magnetization is

which becomes equal to ~s;owhen H goes to zero. Thus, an infinitesimal field selects
the phase with magnetization parallel to the field and the system acquires a finite
magnetization.
The non-anaifyt'rcity of the free energy at H = O comes from the fact that at
H = 0, the magnetization of the system fflps. The free energy thus has the form
sketched i n Fig, 4.4 and the magnetization as a function of H behaves as the M H
phase diagram In Fig. 4.1.
Because the stationary-phase approximation is exact for this model, we see clearly
how the system locks onto one or the other of the two degenerate free field solutions
as

will see that the process of turning off an external field means that whenever we
encounter discretely separated degenerate minima in the Landau function, we calculate
observables by taking into account only one of the mhima,

GENERALIZATIONS
The features we have just seen for the infinite-range lsing model are very suggestive
of the structure which will emerge in the next section when we address more general
systems. in preparation, it is useful to dkcuss more generally some of the salient
concepts,
Order Parameters. In many eases of physical interest, we will be able to express
the partition function as an integral Z = Jdpc-flL('vX) such that at the stationary
point,
corresponds to the thermal average of a microscopic observable and satisges
the Landau definition of an order parameter. in the infinite-range lsing model, ye =
m = (j$
S<)and we found that m was zero above T,= T , and non-zero below T,.
The essential issue is to identify the physical order parameter. Once it is known, it is
straightforward t o formulate a suitable integrat for Z.
Thus far, we have restricted our attention to global order parameters which specit"y
the value of some physical obsewable averaged over the entire system, It will also prove
useful subsequently to consider a tocal order parameter specifying the average value
of the obsewable at a specific position, Thus, for the magnetic example, the tocal
order parameter is the local magne6ration nq = (Si) and the global order parameter
representing the integral over all space. In
is the total magnetization m = Ci
Fourier space, m is just the iC, =. O mode, VJe shalt we that it is e a q t o generalize the
Gaussiian transformation for a single global order parameter p to a general Gaussian
integral over a local order parameter pi defined on alt the lattice sites.
Landau Energy. The exponent t ( p , H ) appearing in the integral for the partition function naturally satisfies the definition of the landau function. The absolute
minimum of L(p,H ) dominates Z in the stationary phase approximation. so the minimum of t specifies the state of the system.
Phase Boundary and Critical Polnt. The order parameter varies discont"lnuously at a first-order phase transition and continuously at a second-order phase transition, In the infinite-range lsing model, m varied discontinuously as H crossed zero
below Te and the transithon was thus first order. This discetnthuity in H ctearty arose
from the N -+ oa limit since the ratio of the thermodynam'ic weights of two nearly
degenerate wells in Eq. (4.10).

critical exponents introduced in this and subsequent sections are summarized in Table
4 3 at the end of the chapter for reference.
Conjugate Field. A field which couples linearly t o the microscopic variable whose
expectation value is the order parameter is called the field conjugate to the order
Si
parameter. In the lsing example. H is the conjugate field because of the X
coupling in Eq. (4.10). The conjugate field, or symmetry breaking field, breaks the
degeneracy of the degenerate double welt and drives the discontinuous transgtion below
Tc from finite positive m at positive H' to finite negative m at negative H. A second
order transition occurs for some specific value He of the conjugate field a t the critical
temperature- The behavior of m at Te for H near He is described by the critical
exponent 6 defined

so that 6 = 3.
Susceptibility, For the fsing example we have seen In Eq, (4.6) that the susceptibility for the order parameter, defined as the linear response of the order parameter
t o an infinitesimal conjugate field, is also the fluctuation of the order parameter, This
relation holds in general for all cases In which the conjugate field couples linearly to the
order parameter, Thus, in general, the susceptibility diverges at a second order phase
transithn, and the critical exponent 7 chauacterhzirrg this divergence is defined by

For the infinite range emmple, according t o Eq., (4.20) 9 = 1, In the case of a first
order transklion, there is no divergence in the susceptibilky,
Universal Behavlor, In the present formulation, the crkical behavior of a system
is described by an integral over an order parameter of an action which is a functional
of the order parameter. To the extent to which the functionals of the order parameter
are equivalent for d'rEerent systems, the criticat behavior of these systems will coincide.
The discussion of the power series expansion of the Landau function is highly suggestive
that only a finite number of terms may be relevant t o the cdtiical behavior, and the form
of these terms may in fact be highly constrained by~symmetrycondderations. Thus,
It is not surpriskng that a large number of physkally distinct systems may belong to
the same universality chss in the sense that they have identical critical exponents. For
example, the ferromagnet lrPi"eOs, the antiferrornagnet FeF2, the fluid X e , the alloy

@-brass, the molecular crystal N f i G L , and the three-dimensional Ishg model are all
characterized by ai spin-like order parameter and belong to the same universality class,
Symmetry Breaking. Very often, a phase transition occurs through the mechanism of a symmetry break"tng, In the magnetic examp'te, the Hamittonian H =I:
SiSi is invanant with respect t o reversal of all the spins Si -. -Si. Normally.
we would expect that (Si) -. (-Si) = 0. The appearance of a finite magnetization i s

More generally, let us consider a Wam'rlt;onian %(gi) invariant under a group of
transformations on its degrees of freedarn (g&

Then, all states (B:) obtained from ( q i ) try the action of the group G have the same
energy, and thus the same Boitrman factor, The conjugate field must have the property
that when added linearly to the Hamittonian, it lifts fat least partially) the degeneracy
of X, For example, in the magnetic case, fir
S; breaks the invariance with respect
to spin reversal, Hence, the symmetry group Q@ of the perturbed Hamirtonian

must be a subgroup of the group 9 ( g t strictly inclded in 9). The perturbed Hamiltonian U t then satisfies

We will see in Section 4 that the nature of the residual subgroup Qtccontrots the
stabilb a d excitation spectrum of the ordered low-temperature phase, In general, the
knawfedge of the order parameter is guided by general symmetry considerattons, and
by some physical intuition of the nature of the phase transition and of the conjugate
field, In some cases, however, the order parameter can be a non-measurabte quant"ly,
not uaiquely desned, or its physical nature can be very complex [as in the case of spin
gf asses).

PHYSICAL EXAMPLES
Table 4.1 summarizes the order parameter governing the phase transitions for a
var"t@ of physical systems, as well as their coupling to conjugate fields. The antiferromagnet is similar t o the ferromagnet we have discussed at length with the excegtian
that the interaction J
SiSj favors antialignment of adjacent spins. For bipartite
lattices, such that every sprn on one sublattice A is surrounded by nearest neighbors
on the other sublattice 13 and vice @erg@,m and cFJ for the ferromagnet are simply
replaced by staggered fields rns and Hs defined with opposite signs on the two sublattices. The ferroetectric transition in polar crystals is analogous to the ferromagnet
with the spins S; and magnetic field W replaced by the polarization 1Z; and electric field
E. Similarly, the binavy alloy transition is analogous t o the liquid-gas transition we
have described.

The condensate density thus has the behavior sketched in Fig. 4.6a characteristic of
an order parameter or a function of: an order parameter,
To identify the local order parameter and understand the similarity to the magnetic example, it is helpful to recall the stationary-phase treatment of Bose condensation in Section 2.5, We wrote the path integrali in the space of coherent states
which have the property
= + ( z f , The actlon in the
14) = dr'(r)'f (~~10)
resulting path integral. Eq, f2.215a), depended
dds only through bitinear
combinations cji'(x, t ) &1(z"t ) , so the action was invariant with respect to the global
gauge transformation O(z,t ) -+ cia$(z, 6 ) . In the stationary-phase approximation. the
acdon was dominated by a constant solution, with #(l;) = O [appropriate for the high
temperature phase) or $(z) = 4, where 4, is a complex constant with magnitude
and arbitrary phase refiecling the gauge symmetry, Thus, in this approximation, the
condensed phase is characterized by a state in which ( 4 ( z ) )= 9, which is analogous
to the magnetic case characterized by the state with (S(zi)) = 6%.We therefore identify ( $ ( S ) ) as the local order parameter and $ dz($(z)) as the global order parameter.
Note that because the solutbn is spatially uniform, only the zero momentum mode is
non-vankhing. Also, by the properties of coherent states
that the condensate density is n o = jCbcj2 ancf. as expecte
parameter. Because the order parameter 4, is complex with an arbitrary phase, the
phase diagram has the structure sketched in Fig. 4,6b, The two degrees of fredorn in
the complex order parameter 4 re analogous t o two components of 6% in the z: -- y
model for which the magnitude
Ss fixed but the orientation Is arbitrary. As in the
spin ease, there is a Goldstone mode associated with the degenerate phase angle.
The analogy w i t h p i n may be extended further by considering the addition of
external sources S d z l $ t ( z ) . J ( z ) ~ * ( z ) G ( z ) ]as in Section 2.4 analogous to the
coupling to an external magnetic field dzi f i ( z i ) * $(xi). For finite sources J*,J .
the Hamiltonian is no longer number-conserving, so for the exact eigenstate we know
($(z)),*, J f 0. It is only in the care of identically vanishing sources that number
conservation implies ( $ ( s ) ) ~ . , ~ =
= ~0,just as for the zero field ferromagnet, equal
Boltzmann weighting of all states would imply ( $ ( g i ) ) = 0. Thus. in the zero geld
limit, the Bose condensate exhibits broken symmetry, and depending upon the path

along which the sources are turned ofF, the condensate has a definite phase.
IF one wants t o construct a solution of fixed paelcfe number, one must project
by taking the appropriate linear combination of the degenerate solutions. For example,
if we write 4, =t pei4, a state of definite particle number may be projected fram a
coherent, state as follows

Once the order parameter for Bose condensation Is recognized, the order parameter
for superconducting or superfluid transitions follow naturally. For superconducting
metafs, pairs of electrons at the Fermi surface, form bound states (Cooper pairs) which
behave eRectively as Barons and thus undergo Bose conde~satian.~
Since the bound
(z)q4( S ' ) , there
states are spin singlets, and the annihilation operator for a pair is
In liquid SHe. the short
is just one complex order parameter A = ($t(z)Gl(zr)).
range reputsion is so strong that pairs $8 relative S-waves are much less bound than
in relative pwaves, and by antisymmetry the p-wave pair rave Function must be a
spin triplet. Coupling spin 1 and angular momentum 1 invaives 9 diRerent comptex
amplitudes, and the resulting 18 real components of the order parameter give rise to
an exceedingly rich physical phase structure.

The mean Fieid theovy, first introduced by P, Weiss in the study of the ferromagnetic transition, provides a simple yet powerful theory of phase transitions. We will
see that its validky depends cruc'ially on the spatial dimension d. For d sufficiently
large, greater than an upper critical dimension d,, the mean field theory is very good at
all temperatures, It yields the exact critical exponents, which means that It correctly
takes into account the divergences which occur a t the critical paint, and It provides a
starting point for systematic corrections, Below d, but above a lower critical dimension
del the mean fietd still works well except close to the critical point, where it yields the
incorrect critical behavior, Below the lower critical dimension, de, the mean field theory
is invalid and its predictions are quariitatively wrong.

LEGENDRE TRANSFORM
To fo_rrmulate the theory in terms of the order parameter G5i rather than the external Field H ; , It is natural to use the Gibbs free energy, r(%i),which is the tegendre
transform of the free energy F ( & ~ ) .Hence. let us review several basic ideas from
Section 2.4, where the source Ja corresponded t o the external Field Hi, the field 4,
corresponded t o the order parameter p,and the generating function for connected

Any linear transform of the microscopic order parameter is also an order parameter in the Landau sense, because it vanishes in one phase and is non-zero in the

Before proceeding; beyond the mean geld theory, several observations should be
made. The first i s that the Landau theory discussed in Section 4.1, which was originally introduced on a purely phenomenological basis, follows naturally fvom mean field
theory, Recall that the Landau function was defined as a function of the global order
parameter with the property that its minimum specifies the state of the system. When
the partition function is written in the form Eq. (4.85) as a functional integral over
an order parameter f (F) and the stationary phase approximation produces a spat'ialfy

microscopic definition of the Landau function, and the criterion for the va1"rity of the
tandau theory is the valid"ry of the stationary phase approximation.
Note that since an analytic function of the order parameter is also an order parameter, there is considerable freedom to define alternative Landau functions, For example,
"r the case of lsing spins, both S(4i), Eq, (4.521, and P ( q ) : Eq. (4.57) are equivalent
Landau functions and are related by the transformation
= th(84i)=
B(4Q).
Since these two order parameters are proportional near the. critical point, they necessarily have the same critical behavior.
The previous discussion of the symmetry properties of the tandart function applies
both to the Legendre transform and to thdt exponent of the functional integral, and
is frequently useful in identifying the allawed forms of their series expansions. For
example, the (7 ( n ) symmetry of the ra-component spin model implies that onfy povvers
of ??a2 may appear as in Eq. (4.75). In contrast, there are no exact symmetries for the
order parameter 4 = Pfirluid - Pgasin the liquid gas phase transition, and in fact odd
terms in gl enter the expansion after fourth order.
The second observation about the mean field theory is the remarkable absence of
any dependence of the critical indices of the spin models we considered on the spatial
dimension D,the number of spin components n, or even the detaifs of the coupling
matrix Jii. These features only affect the actual value of the critical temperature, The
critical exponents for the nearest neighbor O(n)model with any n or D are identical
to those of the infinite-range modet for which the stationary phase approximation is
exact. When we examine corrections to the stationary phase approximation, that
is fluctuations around the mean field, we wilt see that n, D,and Jii may play an
important role. In some cases, such as the infinite range model or high enough D,we
willf see that the fluctuations do not ageet the critical behavior and that the mean field
result is eexcct. At the other extreme, for cases such as the lsing model in 1 dimension
or the s - y model in 2 dimensions, we wilt see that fluctuations completely after the
mean-field result. Hence, we now grocrted to cafcutate the contributions of fluctuations,

LANOAU GfrMZBURG THEORY AND DIMENSlONAL ANALYSIS
We have just seen that the Landau Function corresponds to the expansion of the
exponent OF a functional integral over an order parameter for the special case of a
spatially uniform order parameter. In studyhng Ructuations, we wit1 be interested in
the more general case of a spatially dependent local order parameter, and the correspondhng expansion of the exponent in terms consistent with the symmetry of the
system yields the tandau-Ginzburg functional. Suppose we have a problem with local
-4[r), and with
order parameter dfr), possessing symmetry with respect to d(r)
translation and rotation invariance, In addition to the even powers of + ( r ) discussed
previously in connection with the Landau function, the action may contain invariant
derivative couplings of the fields. The iowcst-order derivative term consistent with the
symmetries is ( a 4 ( r ) ) 2 ,i n which case the Landau-Ginzburg functional in zero field

For a uniform order parameter +(r) =. m, we recover the familiar Landau form and the
( ~ + ( r ) ) 'term accounts for the additional energy required if the order parameter is

criticaf behavior, it is shown in Problem 4.2 that terms involving higher derivatives of

tn general, the bandau Ginzburg functional can always be obtained by expanding
the exponent of a functional integral over an order parameter, and we will now iltustrate

limtt. Although the lsing problem on a lattice has a fundamental microscopic length
scale, the lattice spacing a. we have seen that the behavior near the critical point is
characterized by fluctuations and a correlation length which become arbitrarily large.
Thus.'for the long-wavelength excitations of the system which dominate the physics.
the microscopic length a is irrelevant, and the correlation length determined by the
coefficients in Eq. (4.100) is the physically relevant length scale. At the critical point.
where the correlation length diverges, the system has no characteristic length scale
and is expected to behave as a scale invariant system. The dominance of the long
wavelength, or infrared, behavior of the action near the critical point, illustrated here for
the lsing model. is completely general. Far example. in the liquid-gas phase transition,
the correlation length becomes arbitrarily large compared to the microscopic length
scale associated with the molecular potential v ( r ) ,and the potential only affects the
magnitude of the coefficients in the expansion of the exponent of Eq. (4.94). By the
same argument. the critical behavior of a quantum system is also dominated by length
scales arbitrarily large relative to the microscopic quantum scale, and quantum effects
only contribute to the numerical values of coefficients.
Having established that the critical behavior is governed by a Landau Ginzburg
functional of the form Eq. (4.96). we now examine the role of the spatial dimension

LOWER CRITICAL BlMENSlQN
The z - y model illustrates one of the ways in which the mean field approximation
may completely break down in sufficiently low dimension. Let _us consider the correlation function far transverse fluctuations. The external field H couples linearly to
the order parameter so in the representation (4.135).the coupling of the transverse
field t o the fluctuation field may be written d D z H a ( z )$ a ( ~ ) . Hence, the transverse
correlation function is

4,

where we have used the Fourier representations (4.135b) and (4.531b).
The convergence of the transverse correlation function depends on the dimension
D. For more than two dimensions, D 2, the integral (4.140) converges at k = Q.
The Goidstone modes generate finite fluctuatians which tend to disorder the system,
but the phase space factor dDk renders their effect finite, fn contrast, for D 5 2,
the integral diverges, and the Goldstone modes eompretely disorder the system, This
result is the essence of the Mermin Wagner theomm (1966), which states that for an
a-vector model, with n 2, the tawer critical dimension is 2. That is, for 13 2, spin
waves destroy the long range order of the magnetizatlon, and the mean field prediction
of magnetic order is csmpletely incorrect.
VVe can understand the lower critlcal dimension for magnetic systems somewhat
mare general'ly by physical arguments based on domain walis, This approach not only
reproduces the spin wave instabiiity just identified for vector spins, but also identifies
the relevant mechanism for lsfng spins. Whenever a system has degenerate states of
broken symmetry, one must consider configurations In which the system breaks up
into domains of digevent states separated by domain walls. Since in the vicinity of
the walls, spins are nat optimatry aligned, domain walls increase the internal energy.
However, because there are so many alternative positions for the walls, they may also
significantly increase the entropy, Depending upon the competition between internal
energy and entropy in the free energy, the system wilt either remain magnetically ordered
or spontaneously break up into domains.
Let us heuristicafly estimate the entropy and internal energy of a plane domain in
a D-dimensional system wit22 linear dimension I;, Since the plane may be located at
any position along any of the D axes, the number of possible positions is
so the
entropy behaves as

>

<

S-DInf;..

(4.141)

The internal energy may be estimated by examking the interactions between
successive layers of spins as sketched in Fig. 4.8. For lsing spins, a domain extends
over only one lattice spacing, and the cost in energy relative to a uniformly magnetized
state is proportional to the number of spins at the surface of the domain wall

If D 5 1, the entropy dominates, the free energy is negative, and the system will
spontaneously break up into domains, F=or II > X, at sufficiently low T the Internal
energy dominates yielding a positive free energy and a state of uniform magnetic order
is stable with respect to domain fsmatbn, Tkius, for lsing spins, the tower critical
dimension is i.
For vectlx spins, we note that the domain wall energy (4,143) decreases with
increasing waif thickness A. Since A. is limited by the length L of the system, we have

If we allow the wall thickness t o approach the size of the system, its possible positions
become restricted and the entropy estimate (4,141) becomes an overestimate

Hence, we have the following inequality for the free energy

tf D r 2, we are assured that betow some fin%@T , the free energy is positive and an
srdered magnetized state is stable, Although the present inequafirty cannot distinguish
whether the disordered case arises at D = 2 or lower, it is clear physically that the
ddscalized domain wall is essentially a spin wave. The domain wall argument i s thus
consistent with the spin wave calculation (4.540) which showed that the lower critical
dimensbn is 2.

ORDER PARAMETERS AND BRQKEN S Y M M E T R Y

THE ANDERSON-HIGGS MECHANISM
The zero-mass Gotdstone modes we have been discussing associated with degenerate broken symmetry states only occur for finite range interactions. For example,
as long as the interaction is neglighble beyond some finite number of lattice spacings,
spin naves as sketched In Figg,4.8 will have zero energy in the long wavelength 'limit.
However, fur infinite range interactions, spins with some finite relative rotation will produce a positive excitation energy at any distance, so the energy at zero wave number
will be finite and the mode becomes massive, Thus, it is not surprising that systems
with electromagnetic interactions and having broken symmetry do not have zero mass
Goldstone modes.
What is remarkable, however, is the structure which emerges for a theory with
spontaneously broken sy mmetry w hich also possesses a local gauge invariance, This
phenomenon was originally discovered by Anderson (1958) in the context of an electromagnetic field in a superconductor, and was extended t o mare general gauge field
theories by Anderson (1963)and Higgs ($9641, W will ilfustrate the essential idea for
a charged scafar field coupled to the etectromagnetic field, From the discussion in Section 4.2, one may regard the scalar field as the order parameter for a suberconductor
and consider the present model as a Landau Ginzburg description of an electio&agnetic
field in a superconductor,
To facilitate the treatment of gauge invariance, it is convenient to extend our
previous discussion of spatiaHy dependent local fields to include space and time dependence on an equivalent basis, and t o use the covariant natation of relativistic field

As in the original presentation of
path integrals, we will consider the path integral as an integral over the Lagrangian
wvitten in terms of the fetds, and to study fluctuations, we will be concerned with
expanding the Lagrangian to second order in the fluctuations around the stationary

To appreciate the structure of the "rnteracting theory, first consider separate, noninteracting scalar and electromagnetic *fields. The charged scafar field is described by
the real and imaginary components of a complex field, or equivalently by +*(S) and
# ( X ) . The Lagrangian contains the kinetic term

a

The mode c(z), which in the non-interacting case was the massless component of
the scalar field corresponding t o fluctuations along the minimum of the potential,
no longer appears explicitly in the action. Instead, it has been subsumed into
the field j ( z ) by the gauge transformation, Eq. (4.154). The massless Goldstone
node is said to have been ""gauged away'" Only the massive node q of scalar
field remains, and its mass is ana8ected by the coupling to the electromagnetic
field,

* The electromagnetic field J@(z) diRers from the free-field solution to Maxwell's
equation in two crucial respects. By Eq. (4.156d)it has a mass mZ = - 2 e Z z .

Furthermore, the four components
have a single constraint, the Lorentz gauge
condition (4,156~) so that there are three independent massive modes in contrast to the two transverse massless modes for Naxweftk equations. Thus, the
massless Goldstone mode of the scalar field f has been egeetively replaced by the
massive longitudhat component of the electromagnetic field,

CHAPTER 5
GREEN" FUNCTIONS

In Chapter 2, Green's functions emerged as natural quantities t o characterize
many-particle systems, Qn the one hand, they are defined as thermal or ground state
averages of t'ime-ordered products of operators which are directly calculable i n perturbation theory, and on the other hand they may be related easily to expeimental
obsenrables. Thus, although any paeicular obsenrable could be calculated directly
using the techniques of Chapters 2 and 3, it Is worthwhite to develop the general properties of Green" functions which are applicable to a broad range of phenomena and
are widely utilized in the literature.

The n-bady real-time Green" function In the Grand Canonical Ensemble was
defined in Eq, (2.21) as the thermal trace of a time-ordeved product of creation and
annihilation operators in the Weiisenberg representation:

To simplify and unify the notation, It is convenient to replace operartors
a f ( t ) in the a-representation by field operators defined in Eq. (1.89) $ ( z , t ) I
ei(ir-@B)rd(z)e-i(B-at

and to denote the thermal average by brackets:

Note, foflowing the convention established in SmLTon 1,1, any internat degrees of
freedom such as spin or Osospin, which may have been explicitly included in the label
a,are now implicitly Tnctuded in x. It will; often be desirable to compress the notatbn
stili further, reptacing the arguments {x,t,) by n:

Similarly, using field operators in the imaginary-time Helsenberg representation,
Eq. (2.231, af ( r ) -+ 4(z, r ) = e(8-'&lr$(z)e-(8-'A)r
the thermal Green's function
defined In Eq. 12.22) may be written

where the brackets again denote the thermal average, Mote that in this notation realtime and thermal Green" functions are distinguished by arguments G and r , respectively,
Finally, the zero-temperature Green" function is defined as the ground state expectation value:

t o emphasize its similarity "t structure to the finite temperature Green" function, we
wilt also write it

~ c ~ j ( z. - ~z,t,iz\t:s..
t ~ ,

m

.

~",t',) = ( - i ) " ( ~ $ ( z l t *~ $(z,t,)$'(z',t',)
)

- q(z\t\))
(5.3b)

Note that finite and zero-temperature Green's functions are distinguished by the use
of $ and G,and that the brackets denote a thermal trace or ground state expectation
value, respectively, Also, the inclusion of the factor (-i)" in Eqs. (5,lf and (53) is
not a universal convention: whereas it is used by Abrikosov, Gorkov and Dzaloshinski
(ISS3),Doniach end Sondheimer (1974). Fetter and VVaSecka fd971), and Kadanoff and
Efaym (1962),nu factor of i is used by Thouliess f1912), and Brown (1972) uses
Physkclly, the real-time Green" functions at finite and zero temperature have
an obvious interpretation: they describe the propagation of disturbances created by
injecting particles at the space-time points ( z l i t l ) * (z,t,)
and removing them at
(zitg - .{zkt",). Note also that the definitions are quite general, applying ta finiteor irrfinite systems, with no requlrement of translational invariance.
Since one-particle Green's functions will be studied in detail in subsequent sections, it is useful to introduce several auxilhary definitions, For notational convenience,
the superscrbt (n) will usually be omitted on one-particle Green" functions. The two
time orders in real-time Green" functions at zero or finite temperature are distinguished

destruction operators. it may be obtained directly from the n-particle Green's function
by evaluating all the times associated with creation operators at time t+ infinitesimally
later than the time t associated with the destruction operators:

GREEN'S FUNCTIONS

We have already shown in Chapter 2 that thermal Green" functions for the noninteracting system are pdodlc or antiperiodic with period @. Thus, the interacting

G>($- t' - i p ) appropriately as follows, using Eq. (5.40) and the cyclic property of
the trace:

This periodicity is consistent with the domain of continuation shown in Fig. 5.3, since
the discontinuity between G> and G< adjacent to the real axis must be repeated again
along the .t. -- t1 =.: f ip axes.
Ta study the analytic properties in the w plane, we insert a complete set of states

Note that we have used the fact that the only non-vanishing contributions ads@for
states in which the number of pavtictes in state n, .Em,

we confirm that the factors B(fw) = B (f(wo - p)) agree with Eq. (5.31b). The sum

OPTICAL POTENTIAL
Another impofiant physical propevty of the self-energy is the fact that it specifies
the optical potent'rat for the scatteving of a particle fmm a composite system made up
of identical particles (Bell and Squires 1959).

Consider the elastic -* :3:t%brir.i; L an electron from an atom or a nucteon from a
nucleus. Since the compc,are system is requ'lred to remain in its ground state, the
asymptotic scattering state nay be described by a wave function #(r)depending only
on the relative eoordhaate between the composite system and the scatter& particle.
By definition, the optical potential is a one-particle potential producing phaw shifts
identically equaI to those produced In +(r)for the full many-body problem. Note that
since any phase-shift equiwlent potential is satisfactory, the optical potential is not
unique.
The essential point in relating the optical potential t o the seif-energy is the obsewation that the wave funetion can be written in terms of the one-particle Gren*s
function. Since G(rtlrft)) is the amplitude for adding a particle to a system at r't'
and detecting it at rt, it is cleat that we should be able to express the scattering wavefunction fn Lerms of G, Ta be precise, let I*) be the ground state of the N-body
composite system and pick the zero of the energy scate such that Its energy i s zero.
Then a scattering state may be generated by creating a particle at some point v' far
away from the system at time tt and projecting onto a specific energy E by integrating
over initial times
(t'

- t) + B(t - t')c-'H(t-")+t(r')

Since the optical model wave function is the amplitude for obserrring one parSicle at r
and all other particles in the ground state jk),
we obtain

the target and there are thus no parlictes for to annihilate. For convenience, we will
evrtluate the wave function at time 14 = O and drop the factor d m that #(r) = G(& r, rf).
Consider, for reference, the problem in which the interacting Mamittonian H is
replaced by & = T U, where U is a one-body potentlal (such as the Hartree-Fock
potential) producing a first approximation to the localized N-body target. Then, by
the previous argument, scattering from the onebody potential E f is described by the
wave function +o(r)

This equation clearly has the general structure of the integral equation discussed in
Section 2.4 and in fact tzorresponds to the Bethe Salpeter equation in the parlicie-hole

are several circumstances under which the exchange term maJl be neglected. First,

A second exampie is use of the high-spin twhntque to treat
Bosons, in which case the direct tern dominates the exchange term by the factor N. A
specific application to the correlation energy of the dilute Sose gas is gjven in Problem
5.7, Finatly, in any system such that the momentum dependence of the potential is
negligible between 0 and 2kp, the exchange term may be effectively included with the
direct term. An example is the nsponse function for the one-dimensional S-function

The sum of all direct RPA chain diagrams is abtained by multiplying Eq, (5,112b)
by r7(q), summing over k, and dropping a l exchange terms, with the result

To understand the structure of Eq. (5.115). it is useful t o consider the graphical solutions sketched in Fig. 5.13. Since &(~,w) is symmetric in w (see Problem 5.6). it
suffices to consider positive w. For every value of g inside the Fermi sea such that %+G

For each E in the sum contributing to Do(q,w), asymptotes are plotted in Fig. 5.13.
and Do(q,w) is a decreasing function between each pair of asymptotes. Thus, for a

The collective RPA made, or plasman, is a fundamental excitation of the electron gas
which is readily obsemable experimentally, For example, if one measures the energy
loss of etectrons in solids, peaks are obwwed at multiples of W,. Since typical Fermi
energies in metals are of the order er
5 - 20eV, the plasma frequency is in the

leading correction to W, which we have not calculated here. is proportional t o p2
In contrast to the case of the repulsive Coufamb potential, many physical systems
have scattering channels in which the interaction is attractive at the Fermi surlace, Tn
which case the collective mode is il~weredin energy, Consider, far example the case
of liquid %

On the average, the interaction i s repulsive at the Fermi surface since
It is the short-range repulsive care of the two-body potential whkh keeps the ilquid
from collapstng t o higher density. However, although there is neglkgible explkcit spin
dependence in the underlying potential, because two "~e atoms in a spin triplet state
must be spatially antisymmetrk, they feel the hard core much less strongly than two
atoms in it singlet state, and the interactbon in the triplet channel is averall attractive.
Thus, the spin-dependence tends t o drive the system toward a ferrornagnetic state
and manifests itself in a low-energy collective RPA mode known as a paramagnon. In
the limit Sn which the attraction between 13ke spins were strong enough to drive the
system ferrornagnetic, this mode would occur at zera energy. Although it is not pushed
down that far, it makes a significant contribution to the self-energy, In addition t o the

a single $He atom through the medium, one must also drag along a large cluster of
atoms wSth the same spin.
A second example is the case of pion condensation in neutron or nuclear matter
at high density (occurring for example in neutron stars). Whereas the 9He-9He interaction is attractive in the a - a channel, by vSrtue of the spin-lsospin coupling of
plons t o nucleons and the resuttf ng strong tensor forces, the nucleon-nucleon interaction at the Fermi surface is stmngiy attracJive in the o .cr 7 7 channel, giving rise
to low energy collective excitations with the quantum numbers of the pion, Although
uncttrta'inties in the behavior of strong interactions at high densi& makes quantitative
predictions unceutain, this mode is predicted t o have zero energy and thus t o lead to
pion condensation at a density several times the: density of nuclear matter.
We now consider finite-range repulsive potentials, for which the low-q behavior
of the coltective mode Fs compfeteiy different than for the Coulomb potential, Since
non-Coulombic potentials are less singular than $ at low q, the dispersion relation
GB = 1 cannot be satisfied far a finite w , so u + Q as q -+ 0, Thus, modes which go
t o zero at large wavelength are the generat rule, and the finite energy modes such as
the plasmon are excepdonal eases associated with the infinite range of the force. Note
that we Rave already seen an example af the role of the force range in cansidering spin
waves. Since orienting dtflemnt spin domains in different directions costs no energy
except at the domain boundaries, if the force range is finite, the egect of the boundaries
bwornes negligible in the tong wavelength Ihmit and the energy of such a Goldstone
mode must go t o zero. Only if the: force range is infinite do the boundary contributions
remain finite, yielding a finite excitation energy.
To simplify the discussion of the collective mode, which is called zero sound, let
us consider the case in which G(g) is independent af q at small g and define

The distribution is thus highly anisotropic and is concentrated in the forward

is concentrated in the longitudinal dkection and the transverse radius of the fermi surface fs unaEectel2, the mode is more like one-dimensional thermodynamk sound than
three-dimensional thermodynamic sound, consistent with Eq, (5.124).
Zero sound and thermody namie sound thus represeot two opposite extremes, Zero
sound is built out of quasirparticles, sa at finite temperatures the frequency must be
high enough that the quasipartlctes do not decay, that is, that collisions do not dominate, Quasiparticles travelling in the direction are thus not scattered in the transverse
directions and the mode can remain essentially one-dimensional. At zero temperature,
for which we have performed our calcu!ation, the lifgtlme becannes infinite as quasipaeicles approach the %rmi surface, so zero sound propagates at aff frequencies. In

of a Fermi gas while the zero temperature calculatian produced X = O. The zero
temperature theory finds the- lowest dgenstrate with the same; symmetry as the noninteracting system. Since the non-interacting system brad equal Fermi spheres for spin

up and dawn, the perturbation H could not arter this symmetvy and thus produced
no magnetization. In contrast, the trace in the finite temperature thwuy has access
to ail symmetries and thus produces the asymmetric population of the Fermi spheres
reflected in Eq. (5,ld9).

DYNAMIC SUSCEPTIBlttTV AT ZERO TEMPERATURE
From Eq, (2.251, the reoponse of the magnetization m&to an infinitesimal external
magnetic field -w&H&
is given by the response function ([0(1)*@(2)1). Hence, the
dynamic suscept'ibil"ry, which is defined as the response of M to an infinitesimal fielid
of frequency w and wave vector Q is given by

where the spin-spin response function is given by

The last Line follows because G is diagonat in spin so that the spin trace simpIy yidds
a factor of 2 equal to the spin factor already included in Do. Hence. using Eq. (5.ii6a)
the tong wavelength limit of the zero frquency susceptibilirty is
(S, m4)

Thus, although we are working at zero bmperature, linear response theory allows the
external field ta break the symmetry of the non-interacting ground state, so the proper

PROBLEM 5.4 Scaling Behavior of the Dynamic Structure Factor and Measurement of the Momentum Distribution

out of the system by transferring a momentum q so large that it is assumed that
the state k + q must be unoccupied. Formally this may be written using Eg. (5.108)

THE LANDAU THEORY OF FERMI LlQUlDS
The general methods presented in previous chapters to calculate observables in
Fermi or Bose systems have been based on perturbation theory. In the case of strongly
interacting systems, even when physically motivated resummations have been made.
it i s dimcult to aswss the reliability of the resulting approximations. Hence. in this
chapter we will present a completely different approach developed by Landau (1956.
1957.1958) for Fermi liquids which provides exact relations between certain observable
quantities*
The domain of validity of the Landau theory is restricted to phenomena which
involve excitations very close to the Fermi surface. In this domain. the fundamental
degrees of freedom of the system are quasiparticles which interact with a quasiparticle interaction f(k,k'). Although the theory does not specify any properties of the
strongly interacting ground state, it describes small departures from the ground state
and response functions. It thus allows one to express a number of observabfes such
as the spc?cific heat, magnetic susceptibility, sound velocity, zero sound velocity, and
transport coeficients in terms of the Enteraction f (k,k". This function can either be
parameter'rzed phenomenologlca(ty By fitting several parameters to experiment, or else
it can be calculated mtcrascopically, in which case the theory becomes exact.
The chapter is organized as fotlows, tn the first sectlon we present the basic
assumptions of the theory in a heuristic and phenomenofogicai manner and in the
next section wt? show how to calculate thermodynamical observables with this set of
assumptions. We emphasize that the arguments in these sections wlll not be rigorously
deduced from general principles; rather, at key points assumptions or postulates will
dmply be introducd following Landau's orighal development. For those who wish
to pursue this approach to tandau theory in further detail, the review of Baym and
Pethick (1976) Is pafliculariy clear and pedagogical. The last section presents the!
microscopic justification of the theory* This microscopic understanding both prov"rcfes
a clear foundation for the postulates of the earlier sections and establishes the relation
of the phenomenological interaction f(k, ic") to the two-body vertex function.

6.1 QOAStPARTlCtES AM0 THEIR INTERACTIONS
Let us consider a uniform gas of spin-$ Fermions, containing N particles in a
volume V , If the Fermions are not "interacting, the ground state of the system consists
of a Fermi sea of plane waves of momenta
kF. The Fermi momentum kF is
related to the density by:

The totat energy of the system i s given by

6.1 QUASIPARTICLES AND TMElR INTERACTIONS

297

where n(g) is the occupation number of the plane wave state (g).

If an arbitrary weak external field is coupled to the system, the net effctct will be
a variation of the occupation numbers, and the corresponding variation of the total
energy can be written:
12

Further. is 9 e field is very weak, it can only excite states close to the Fermi sudace.
so that 6n(A;)will be sharply peaked amund kP.
Let us now adiabatically turn on the interaction between the particles. A normal
Fermi liquid is defined as a system in which the non-interacthng ground state evolves
into the interacting ground state and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
bare particle states of the original system and the dressed or quasiparticle states of
the interacting system, A quasiparticte state with )k+j > kF is defined as the state
obtained from a non-interacting Fermi sea plus a plane waw tk,) by switching on the
interaction. and simikrly, a quasihole state is obtained by starting with a Fermi sea
with a hote in state Ikh).
Note that in order for a system to be a normat Fermi liquid, switching on the
Interaction must not produce bound states. For exampie, in a superconductor, the noninteracting ground state does not evolve into the &CS ground state and the formation of
Cooper pairs destroys the one-to-one correspondence between non-interacting states
and quasipa&icfe states, Throughout this chapter, we will tacitly assume a normal
state, dther by vivtue of a totally reputshe Interaction or by treating temperatures
above the superfluid or superconducting transltlon temperatures. Normal Fermi liquids
t o which the theary is commonly applied include llquid w e , the, electron gas in metals,
and nuclear matter.
We have seen In Eq, (5.72) that the quasiparticfe Lifetime is proportiwal t o
(a - c ~ ) ' . so that even in a normal Fermi system, quasiparticles far away from the
Fermi sudace are Df-defined, unstable states. If one tried to prepare them by turning
on the interaction slowly enough t o be adiabatic, they would decay before the process
was complete. Hence, the Landau theory is only appf'lcabte to tow-lying exdted states
of the system, which are made of superpositions of quasipaeicle excitations close to
the Fermi surface, In particular, it can describe neither the ground state energy, whfch
would require summation over all occuplred states in the sea, nor highly excited states.
Let us temporailly suppress spin and denote the quasiparticle energy by e i and
the interaction energy of quasiparticles of momentum 2 and by f (g, g'). If we apply
a weak perturb_atii to the system which takes it away from iis ground state, it inducer
a change 6n(k) in the occupation number of quasiparticte L, and tandau postulated
that the change in the total energy of the o;ystem is dven by

298

THE LAPIDAU THEORY O F FERMI LIQUIDS

The energy of quasiparticle g, when it is surrounded by other quasiparticles. is
given by:

The interaction f (g, g') of quasiparticles g and 2' is given by

and it i s thus symmetric in

and g'

f ( E s 2) = f(if
g) '
Although the Landau theory is much more general than the Wartree-Fock approximation, it Is instructive t o note that Eq, (6.5)is of the same form as the total Hartree
Fock energy where r: i s the Knetic energy, eg is the self-consistent single-particle
energy and f f (g, g') is the antisymmetrized matrix element of the bare two-body
interaction.
Since quasipartic!es are adiabaticafly evolved from Fermions, they obey FermiDirac statistics and the distributioon functions at finite temperature is gken by the
usual Fermi distribution
4

where p is the chemical potential.
At zera temperature, we recover a step function distribution, and 2 non-zero
temperature, Eq. (6.8) becomes a set of self-consistent equations since e ( k ) depends
on n(z) through (6.6).
VVe now extend the notation t o include spin. Formulas (6.5) to (6.8) are unchanged. except that g should be replaced by ( 2 , ~where
) a is the spin projection on
a gaantization axis and the sums over are replaced by C,=,,/,
In the absence

xz.

of a magnetic field. by symmetry r(i,o)is independent of o, so that r(g,o) = a(g).
Similarly. f (grr, gtd)can depend only on the product o .d . and may be parametrized

with the relation

Note that here cr denotes a spin $ matrix so that a Pauli matrix would be 2 ~ .

Physically, dnce the egective mass is proportional to the density of stateeatthe Fermi

T the specif-ic heat is equal to that of non-interacting Fermions of mass m* and thus
provides a direct experimental measurement of m*. For liquid 3He, the egective mass
ranges from roughly 3m a t zero pressure to over 5m at 21 atm, where the primary

NQNEQUlLIBRIUM PROPERTIES AND COLLECTIVE MODES
The dynamics of a Fermi liquid close to clquil"lrium is governed by a Boltzmann
equation for the quasiparticle distribution, Two fundamental assumptions are required.
The first is that we consider only long wavelength, low-energy excitations. Then, instead of considering the quantum Wigner distribution function introduced in Section
5.4, we may treat the n2n-equilibrium distribution function at position i as a clasricai
distribution function n(k, i", $1. The second major assumption is that the local quasiparticle energy at the position 7, r(g, ?), plays the role of the quasiparticle Hamiltonian,

The microscopic foundation of Fermi flquid theory at zero temperature and the

1 of the vertex function l'(2)
describe the excited states of the N-body and N k 2 - b o d y systems. By restricting our
attention to the relevant poles of the N-body system and anafyzing the structure of
the exact integral equation for the vertex function in the vicinity of these pales, we will
obtain an intcsgral equation for the fundamental excitatians of precisely the same form
as Eq. f6,56a) in the last scrction describing zero sound and collective excitatians, From
this correspondence, we wilt be abfe to relate the quas@article interaction t o the vertex

of the quasipartlcie pole, In addition, we will also be able to identify the quasirparticIe

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF FUNCTtONAL INTEGRALS
Thus far, fundionaf Integral methods have been used to derive more eficientty,
elegantly, or physically, results which could also be obtalned using other ttrchn'iques.
This chapter and the next address a range of problems for which functional integrals
provide unique fnsfghts and approximat9ons.
tn the first section of this chapter, we wiil show how to generate a variety of afternatlve functional integrals for the evolution operator w h'ich give rise to digerent physical
approximations in the stationary-phase approximation. In Section 2, we show how to
pedarm the (general saddle point approximation around a static mean field solution and
derive an expansion in terms of the fundamental ~"rrationalexcitations of the system.
tn subsequent sections, we shaw h w time-dependent mean field solutions may be used
to calculate transgtion amplitudes between specific states, approximate quantum eigenstates of large amplitude wlfective motlon, study banier penetration and spontaneaus
fission, and evaluate the asymptotic behavior of far@ orders of perturbation theory.

7.1 REPRESENTATCOMS OF THE EVOLUTlQN OPERATOR
Dlgerent functional rntegrail represntatlons for the evolution operator produce
digerent physical approximatbons On the stationary phase approximatisn. For warnpie,
the Feynman path integral obtained by inserting complete sets of coordinate states
yidds the classical equations of motion whereas the functional Integral derived from
inserting Bason coherent states produce the Wartree equations of motion for the Bose
condensate wave function. Thus, in this section we will explore the f r d o m available
in formulating functknal integrals for the evolution operator and how to exploit this
freedom in making physical approximations. To foeus the discussion, we will consider
Fermion systems. The modifications to treat Bosons are straightforward.

OVERCOMPLETE SETS OF STATES
An alternative and powerful method for generating functional integrals is to use
overcomplete sets of states. A set af states is overcomplete i f it redundant@generates
the Witbert space U - We shall assume that the set of states is conrinuous, and denote
it by {(p)).Thus, from its definition. there exists a measure dp(p) on the set {IF))
such that any state 121) of the Hlbert space can be decomposed as

The overcompleteness impties that the decomposition [7,15) is not unique. Examples
of overcomplete sets of states are the Boson and Fermion coherent states introduced
in Chapter I.
Fmm (7,151. Et follows that there exkts a decomposition af wiQ:

and this is the bask formula to construct functional integrals, As "t the case of Bason
or RrmSon coherent states, we will assume that the set (!p)).is parmetrized by a

Let us note that when expanding (7.20a) using the stationary-phax method, we

To iliustrate this method and provide the background for the use of Slater determinants for the many-Fermion problem, it is useful to examine several simple examples.

coherent states. As shown in Problem 7.3, it is easy to see that Eq. (7.26) reduces to
the coherent state results obtained in Section 22,

next write the one-body problem as a functional integral over an overcamplete
set of wave functions, The set of all square integrable wave-functions is identical to
the total Wifbert space, and it is thus an overcomplete set. The closure relation in the

We wilt now perform the camplete stationary phase expansion around localized
time-independent solutions. For simplicity, we will use the functional integral (7.7)
in terms of the auxiliary @-field, which will yield the Wartree approximation and a
loop expansion in terms of Nartree phonons. It is possible ta do the same catccllations
using functional integrals over Slater determinants, fq. (7.25). which yield an expansion

At the SPA level, quantum states: of large-amplitude collective mation are fully

speclfy time-dependent oscillations havf ng amplitudes which depend continuously upon
T,and the quantization condition singles out a discrete set of amplitudes and energies
corresponding to quantum eigenstates. The theory represents the simplest availabIe
approximation that has all the physical elements of a fundamental theory of quantum

and the dynamical equations and quantization condition arise with no further preseriptions concerning cotlective variables, inertial parameters, or quantization pracedure.
Furthermore, corrections to the SPA may in principle be systematically evaluated.
Two special limits of these time-dependent equations should be noted, Timeindependent solutions to Eqs. (7.96) correspond to n = O in Eq. (7.103). so the static
Hartree states discussed previously are automallcally included. As shawn in Prsblem 7.10, for Infinitesimal periodic fluctuations about the static Wartree solutions, the

where Jr(r, 7) satisfy the periodic mndition

and the orthonormalky relation

Several ohsewations should be made concerning these equations. First, although this
self-consistent eigenvalue problem is not Hermitian, it has a set of real solutions with
real eigenvaiues, and general solutions differ from these reat sdutions Iby the trivial
phase factors c'(2wsfl)r and eigenvalue shifts i(2nnlT) where n is any integer. The
real solution? will yield the "bouncew solution governing spontaneous fission. Second.
note that if +(t, r) is real, the combination 4r(r, -7)4&(1;7) enterlng oo(r,7) may be
wiltten in terms of the original function $r (P, t = :) as dr(r,t*)*4b(r,t ) , so that it
indeed represents analytic continuation of the real time expression (7.95b) to complex
time. In addition, observe that although Jk(r,r) and Jr(r,-r) grow and decay exponentially in time, the combination Jk(r, -r)dk(r,r) remains normalized so that oo
retains the physical interpretation of a mean field. Finally, note that the static Hartree
solutions are valid r-independent solutions of these equations and in Fact, the bounce
solution will approach the static solution asymptotOcally at large t"re,
To establish contact with the example of a single particle in an inverted potential,
we must express the action for both a single particle and for many fermions in anaifogous Haniftoniian form, First, consider the Lagrangian for a particle in one dimension
with a position-dependent mass:

Mate that although our prevlous one-dimensional example had a constant mass term,
the more generat form in (7.106) is useful in identifying the structure of the many-body
problem. In the usual way, the momentum is p = $$= m ( g ) i and the Hamiltonian is

With this understanding of the structure of the real and imaginary time periodic
solutions, the stationary-phase approximation t o the spontaneous fission of a nucleus
is neady analogous to the treatment of the fifetime of a metastable state in the onedimensional potential, Fig. ?.Id. Recall that in calculating the smoothed level density,
Eq, (7.%), trajwtorles in regian Ill did not cantribute, and summation of periodic
trajectories in regions I and l! yielded the WKB result, Eq. (7.88~). in which the
penetrability was gfven by the reduced actbn of the tritjectafy in region if having an
enerw equat to that of an eigenstate In region I.Thus, in principle, we should sum all
trajedodes in regions I and II of the multidimensional analog of Fig. 7.4.
The essential elements in describing fission are the so-called "bounce" whtutions,

CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS
Whereas the applications of functional integrals in this chapter are physicatfy and
intuitively appeal1ng, they are subject to limitations which require comment.
The most salhet problem is the absence, except in specificaity constructed models, of an expiick small parameter in which to generate! an asymptotic expansion. Recall
that the Feynman path integral has an explicit factor of multiplying the action and
thus generates an asymptotk expansion in powers of h, Unfortunately, the Havlree or
EtartreFock action obtained using an auxll'rary field, caherent states, or an overcomplete set of Slater determinants contabs h In the kinetic energy as well as an overail
muftiplkative factor, Hence, to take advantage of the physics of the mean field, one
must reflnquish a strict wmicIasslcal expansion in powers of h,
A second alternative is t o generate a TIN expansion. One may imagine a class
of theories which diffczr from one another by their interaction strength and the number
N of internal d e p e s of freedom. In ceHain speclat cases, rquiring that the class of
theodes has a sensiMe limit for iarge N spedfies the N dependence of the interaction
strength and atlows one to rescale the integration variables such that an explicit factor
of N will multiply the action. The resulting formal expansion in powers of 1 / N may
then be useful if the physical Hamiltonian embodies a suflciently large number of

7.3 LARGE ORDERS O F PERTURBATION THEORY

3'1%

internal degrees of freedom. A detail& uample is discussed in Problem 7.12. In
the case of nudear physlcs, where there are four spin-lrospin degrees of freedom. one
might naively invoke a %INexpansion with N = 1. Unfortunately, the spin and isospin
dependence of the forcer is m large that the argument is inapplicable. For uample. the
leading contribution to the potential energy. the direct Hafirm potential, is consideraMy
weaker than the Fock exchange tm, which formally should be a factw of 1/N smaller.
Similarly. in S(I(N) nondbelian gauge field theories. where N is the number of colors.
there ir a significant question as to the rele~nceof the large N limit to the physical
a s e N = S,
The lack of an ucplicit upanrlon parameter does not necessarily preclude a p
plication of thc stationary-phasc approximation. Indeed. the functional integrals we
evsluate m;ry well possess saddle points with very large ~ c o n dderivatives in the directions of steepest descent. giving rise to useful and accurate low-order approximations.
For example, in the case of very colfectiw states, it is physically plausible that many
particles pa&icipate in notion characterid by! the appropriate colfectlve wriable, and
that the action for thls variabh is thus multipiid by a suitably large constant reflecting
this coltectivity, However, in this case, there is as y& no quantitative measure: of the
accuracy of the expansion.
A swond aspect ass-ociaited with the lack of agandon parameter 1s the fredom
to wdte a variev of digerent exact expressions, each of which yields a digerent lowestorder approximation. In the a b ~ n c eof a formal expansion parameter, one must be
guided by the phydcs of the problem, and for example choose a formutation which
includes the physical!y relevant combinations of dirwt, exchange, and pairing mean
field contributions. Sfmllarfy, when the presence of strong short-range c~rrelations
rquires that mean-field t h w q be formutatd in terms of some egective interaction
such as a G-matrlx, it is essential to rcrforrnulatethe functional integral in terms of the
e@ect!ve Enteraction instead of the bare interaction. Sfnce the choice of the hnct'lanat
integrat repre%entatlondtstermines the stafllng paint for a systematic rtxpansion. it is
analogous to the choice of the d=omposition of .R into r non-interacting HirmSItonian
Ha defining the unperturbed basis and the residual tnteract'iort V in which one wpands

A finat question concerns the covect counting of quantum states when one considers expandons around all stationary sotutions. The proMem is illustrated by considering
the RPA flmit* S m e RPA states eollrrspond to nearly pure singfe part;lcle-hde excitations which are alsa $enerate;dby a static Wartreefock solution with an apprcrpriate set
of occupation numbers. Thus. in this case, the same physical state is approximated
both by a static self-consistent solution and a time-dependent periDdic isalution. In
general, there thus exists the problem of avercounting the physical quantum states of
a system by considering all stationaq-phase solutions. Since substantial mathematicat
difficulties arise in attempting to add the contdbulions of distfnct stationary solutions,
one must again be guided by pkydcal considerations In selecting the form of aationavy

The eflFective potential is sketched in Fig. 7.8. Note that its relation t o the physical

change associated with a Euctldean path integral, The quartic term, however, comes
from the logarithm in (7.138bj and is positive irrespective of the sign of g. Hence,
whereas the physical potential has a single minimum, the eF1Feetive potential is a double
wel. Using the fact that the energy is a constant of the motion (as may be verified by

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF FUNCTIONAL INTEGRALS

A simple way to implement &s, (I) and (2) for spin saturated systems, that
is, systems in which comesgonding single particie states we occupied with spin up
and apin down Fermionsr, is to use spin dgebra. For a central potential u(rl - rz)
~ l h mth& the following decomposition h= the d e ~ k e dpropertiee

where PS is the apin exchange operator and denotes a Pauli matrix. When the
potent;i;tl is written in this t o m , it is clear that the aaxifiaq field may be expressed
in terms of four independent spatial functions

Show that the quations far the spatial components a; me identical so there are
only turo independent functions which generate the direct and exchange components
of the mean field.
Since this ixltrodactioa of spin dependence may a p p e a wtificial, it is instructive
to consider the relation between an a u x i l i q field functional integral for nucleoxls
interacting via a, static twa-body potential and a field theory of rnesons coupled
to nucleons. Note that the integral Dr ~ - ' " ~ b +:"U" looks like a path integral
for a scalar field coupled to the hrmion field p^ = $t$ with the free scalar field
action c r w , Thus, it is natural fo mgociate vacrious components of the cf field with
vaiaus meson fields. Since the cr. V coupling of pions to nucleons generates a (71
contribution to the nuclear potential, the pion field is naturally associated with the
exchange potential v E . Similarly, the direct potential vD is associated with scalar
meson exchange,

Functional integrals reduce the quantum many-body problem t o quadrature. All
that remains t o calculate the observable properties of physical systems is evaluation of a
very complicated multidimensional integral. In situations in which analytical methods
such as the stationary-phase approximation or perturbation theory are uncantrolled
or impractical. Monte Carlo evaluation of path integrals is a powerful and appealing
afternative, !t provides precise calculations of physical obsewables which are exact
within controtlable systematic and stochastic sampting errors, This chapter describes
the range of techniques available for the stoehastie evaluation of path integrals and
haw this Rexibility may be efeetivety exploited t o incorporate one's understanding of
the underlying physics in the method.

8.1 MONTE CARLO EVALUATION OF INTEGRALS
Wt? will eventually need t a evaluate path integrals of the form

)
P/') denotes the coordinate i of the ia particle on the
rkhtime slice or integrals over fields of the form nijr,&{iL e-5(@)0(o)where c,!$is
a Field defined on a spacetime lattice. It is easy to see that conventional quadrature
methads appropriate for integrals in few dimensions are completely useless far such
problems.
First, consider the number of points at which the integrand must he sampled on
a single time slice for a system like the nucleus a08PB(or equivalently, a drop of liquid
Helium cantaining several hundred particles), Since the rms radius is 7 frn rand the
two-body potential varies significantly on the scale of 0.2 fm, one requires at least 100
mesh points in each carteslan direction for each coordinate, so that the integrand must
be evaluated at ( 1 0 0 )=~10'~~
'~ ~ ~
points.
~ Even at the fastest computer speeds of
the order of 10' evaluations per second or 10" evaluations per year, this corresponds
to
years in a universe whose age is only 2 x 101° years. Similarly, simply
tabulating the integrand at 1OOO values per page in a 1006 page book wdghing 1Kg
would requiw a mass of 10'~" Q whereas the mass of our galaxy is only of the order
4 x 10~'Kg. Clearly, even ignoring the need to treat multiple time slices. the situation
would be hopeless 'if physics required sampling of the integrand in this degree of detaH.
(Note that this same counting indicates that solution of the many-body Schradinger
equation as a finite difference equatfon requires diagonafitatlon of a
X f01248
matrix,
The essence of the problem is the unfavcrrabte way in which the accuracy of conventional quadrature formulae depends on the number of points at which the Integrand
is sampled En high dimensions, Consider, for example, Simpson's rule in one dimension. Since the integrand is tiocalty appr~ximatebquadratically and odd terms vanish,
the leading error in a single interval (-h, h) is $_hhdz z4 = O(h6).I f the total interval
is divided into N mesh points, h -- $ and the total error is of order Nh5
Similarly, in two dimensions. the error in a single square cell is ~_h, dz $!h dy z4 = O (hB)

- h.

and in d-dimensions, the error per cell is O(h4+d).If the integrand in d-dimensions is
and the total error is of order Nh4+&= 0 (
sampled at N points. then h -Thus, as the dimension d becomes large the error fatts off hcreasingly slowly with N ,
Indeed, it is the fact that N must vary as
to keep the error fixed which led
to the impracticaf estimate for 208P6with d = 3 X 208.
The basic idea of the Monte Carlo method is to sample the integral statistically,
so that independent of the dimension of the integral, the sampling errors decrease as
where N is the number of points at which the integrand is sampled. Note that
there is no reason in principle why the evaluation of physical observables should require
Far example,
the incrediibte level of detail cited in the quadrature example for 20"pb,
ln evaluating the potential energy, one only needs t o know the two-body eorretatlion
function accurately within the range of the two-body potential. The detailed behavlor af
distant particles is totally irrelevant and even ifcalculated to high precision, identically
cancels out of the numerator and denominator in calculating ($lvl$)/($l$). Hence.
the fact that we will use valuer of N immensely smaller than the value (~onst)~
required
to fully specify the many-particle wave function poses no problem in principle.

CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM
The Monte Carto method for evaluating an integral is based on the familiar central
limit theorem. Consider an integral of the following general form

where P is a vector in d-dimensions and P(%)is a probabiiity dktribution satisfying
the condition

P(%)2 0

Note that there is "rnfinite freedom, which we will subsequently expfoit, to decompose
the integrand of any multid'tmensional integrat in the form of Eq, (8.21,
VVe will now try to approximate X by forming the average of N independent samples
of the probability distribution P(%)

where throughout this chapter, the notation EieP(3) indicates that the variable E< is
sampled accordhng to the functbon P(B). In order to use such an average as a controlled
approximathn for I , we need to know the probability distributian for the variable X ,
and especialty how this distr"rut"ton behaves for large N . To simplify notation, it is
convenient to define the mean value of a function g(P) with respect t o the d"ltrlbut"rn
B(3) as f o l i w s

(8,k)

402

STOCHASTIC METHODS

By definiticrn, ( f )=~I ,
The: probability for obtaining a particular value X when each 2 is distributed
according to P(%)may be written as follows:

Using the integral representation for the &-function. the probability distribution for X

may be written

where

For a specified value of X, we will perform the X integral using the stativary phase
approximation and denote the stationary value of X for a given X as X(Z1"). The
stationarity condition
= O yields

IX(x)

which implicitly defines ;\(X). including the quadratic correction
f (i(~)),
the probability distdbution for large N i s

'To display the X-dependence of the exponent explkittly, we first find the extrema

where we have used the stationarity condition
solution X(X) = D for which by Eq. (8.7) X = ( f ) p . Expanding t o second order

In the limit as N -+ m.
higher terms in the expansion of the exponent contribute negligibly to the tails of the
distribution. In the sense of distributions, P (X) thus approaches a normal distribution

Equation (8.11)is the desired result which provides the foundation for the Monte Carlo
method, No matter what the distribution P($).the function f (31, or the dimension d .
for large N the average Eq, (8.3)becomes normally distributed about I with standard
#. Thus. a general integral may be approximated
deviation o = [

and the variance may be evaluated by the usuai unbiased estimate*

Note that the factor
to remove the bias is irrelevant for large N so that one
efFectively uses Eq. (8.12) to evaluate both (fa)p and ( f ) ; .

IMPORTANCE SAMPLING
Although in principle, Eq. (8.12)i s applicable to any multi-dimensional integral
which could arise In many-particle systems, i t s practical utility is governed by the sbnal
to noise ratio. The ratio of the vau"lance ta the mean must be sufficiently small that the

which the integrand has nearly cancelfing podtive and negatke cantributians which are
separately very large in magnitude, the Monte Carlo method becomes very difficult to
apply. Such dficulties will be encountered subsequently for Fermbans in more than one
dimension. For problems with dominantly positive integrands, however, the freedom
to decompose the integrand into factors f(%) and P(sj may be effectively exploited to
reduce the variance. Selection of P ( z ) to reduce the variance is known as importance
sanpihng.
The basic idea is most simply demonstrated for a one-dlmensknal integral with
a non-negative integrand. Integrals with bat h positive and negathe contd butlons can
in the same way as the diferrtnce of two non-negative integrals as long as
be treated a
one integral clearly dominates, and the generalization ta higher dimensbn i s obvious.
Consider the integral

which has been wrkten in the form of Eq, (8.1) for an arbitrary probability distribution
P(%).By Eq, (8.121, it may be approximated

The questian, then, is what we can do ta reduce the variance

9,

Obviously. the best choice is to use P(%)=
for which case the variance is
zero and each term in the average
Is simply 1. This optimal choice is only of
academic interest, since ifwe knew I and were able to sample f ( z ) , we wouldn't be
in the business of calculating the integral In the first place. However, it suggests the
extremely useful and practical strategy of choosing P(%)t o be a simple function w hick
i s easy to sample and which is as similar as possible t o f ( S ) ,

Thus, the sample size must be of the order N 4.7 x 10%to obtain 1%accuracy. Now.
suppose we use a simple linear probability distribution P(%)= 22. which we will show
in the next section is easy to sample. As seen In Fig, 8.1, although a linear distribution

Even for a modest dimension d = $0,the reduction of the variance and the necessary
sample size by 8 orders of magnitude becomes quite impressive.

8.2 SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
Application of the Monte Carlo Method requires the generation of statistically
independent variables { 3 ) distributed according t o a specified probaMlity distribution
P($).Because of the diversity of distrlbutlons which may arise in many-body problems,
it is useful to s u m y a variety of sampling technlques.

SAMPLING SIMPLE FUNCTIONS
The fundamental building block for all sampling methods is a random number
generator for varia btes uniformly distributed on the interval (0,1). Computers can,
at best, generate a sequence of pseudorandom numbers which are determined by a
suficiently complicated rule that they appear to be random for all practicat purposes,
One common algorithm: implemented on most computers is the linear congruential
method which generates a sequence of pseudorandom numbers according t a the rule

When a and c are apprapdately chosen, this generates a non-recurring sequence of
length m where m i s the largest integer the computer can represent (i.e., m = 291 - 1
for a 32-bit word). Although this algorithm may be adequate for many purposes if
optima! values of a and c are used, it Fs important to realjire that sequential values of
zi have definite correlations, To see these corretations geometrically, let k sequentla!
points define a point in a k-dimensional space: that is. it = {zl,Q,...,z r ) , T2 =
( z ~ + sk.t.2,.
~,
z Z k )and so an, It may be shown that these points lie on a sequence
of at most mljk k I dimensional planes[Press et. a1..1985). In three dimensions.
a t best, there are 291/3 = 1290 planes for a 32-bit word and only 216/' = 32 planes
for a 16-bit word, In practice, algorithms provided with commercial machines are often

less than optima!. Figure 8.2 shows the 15 planes generated by the randam number
generator orr the IMB P C G d ane notorbus randam number generator on an eartier
main-frame computer produced only 11 planes. It should be obvious that sampling the
integrand of a three-dimensional integral which is hbghty peaked between these planes
uvoutd give totally erroneous results, One eRective cure for such correlations is to stare
pseudorandom numbers in a look-up table and a particularly emcient procedure is given
by Knurhl191J1). For the subsequent discussion, it will be assumed that a satisfactory
random number generator is avaUable t o provide uniformly distr"lbuted random numbers.
Given a uniform distribution of random numbers, It is easy to sample any dktribution specified by an integrable function by dmpfe change of variables, tf we define

then

g = P(%)and we may write

Thus, when the variable y is sampled uniformly, the inverse function z(y) is distributed
accovdlng to the desired probability distuibutbrr P(a). Far instance, the example used

A final elementary method for sampling simple functions is von Neumann rejection

to a probability distribution P(%)to be sampled, If points are generated uniformly in
the plane below F ( $ ) and only those which are atso below B(z) are accepted, then the
accepted points will be distributed according to P(%).Operationally, a random variable
zg is selected with probability proportional to F(%) (i.e.. P (z) = ~ ( z ) / F ( % ) )and
a random number ( uniformly distrlbutcsd an the interval ( O , l ) is generated. The value
zi is accepted if P ( z ~ ) / F ( z>~ (:
) otherwise it is rejected. Clearly, this procedure is
only eflficient i f one can find a function F ( % )which can be emciently sampled and is

NEUMAFtlN-UlAM MATRIX INVERSION
A special problem frequently arising in stochasti~solutions of many-body problems
is sampling of the inverse of a matrix. For example, the Green's Function Monte Carto
method for determining the ground state wave functions requlres repeated sampihng of
P(r) = (rl&Irt). Similarly. when Grassmann variables have been integrated out of a
many-Fermion problem, evaluatbn of the change of the resulting efictive acdon when

Motczcuiar dynamics uses s"rBar ideas from stat"rticat mechanics ta sample an

8.3 EVALUATION OF ONE-PARTICLE PATH INTEGRAL
The stochastic twhniques described above may be applied to many-body problems
in a variety of ways, The principal intellectual chaftenge is to exploit the freedom and t o
utilise physical insight t o Incorporate as much of the essential physics of the problem
as possible into the stochastic algorithm.
There are three main categories of choices to be made: the obsevvabies to evaluate,
whether to sampfe the complete action or solve an initial value problem, and the h r m
of functional integral to calculate, The first two sets of choices may be iltustratcsd most
simply by the Feynrnan path integral for a single degree of freedom discussed in this
section, in addition, even this simple example illustrates two OF the primary limitations
of stochastic methods: the need to calculate a dominantly positive Integral and the
need to independently sampfe the entire range of configurations

In order to sample dominantly positive functions, we must evaluate Euclidean
rather than real time path integrals, One abvlous quantity to sample is the trace of
the evolution operator C, (rile-BHin) which provides all thermodynamic information
at inverse temperature

instead of calculating the trace, it is often preferable to evaluate a specific matrix

Q(%), it follows that Eq. (8.55) is also accurate to O(eZ). In the case of a hard wall
boundary wndition, simply putting an infinite potential into the action introduces an
error of O (J;)as shown in Problem 8.4. Hence, to implement a hard wall boundary
condition a t position z = a, the path integral should be written using states which are
manifestly odd about z = a, with the result

This antisymmetrization just subtracts off the Green's function corresponding to the
first image across the boundary and one can explicitly verify for the first odd state of
the harmonic oscillatar that the leading error is C? (e2) when the first image is included

example, one may introduce a correlated addithe trial change for the entire trajectory

That is, one adds ta or subtracts from each coordinate a [physicalfy motivated) global

move of the form

which can scale the overall. trajectory to a larger or smaller spatial =tent, Note that
any sequence of reversible moves may be overed in any order to fadlitate equilibrium
and complete sampling of the entire space.

Instead of sampling the global action, it is often preferable to calculate matrix

applications of e-CB t o obtain an ensemble distributed according to $ ( S ) = e - @ H + b ( z )

for evaluating ground state properties since instead of having to retain an entire time
history over many time slices, an ensemble of configurations is simply refined by emex
the required number of times. The method has the additional advantage that it can
conveniently Incorporate physical understanding of the nature of the solution.
The simplest method for evaluation of a matrix element of the Eucfidean evolution

the results: of Problem 7.11 for the symmetric well in Eq, (8.681,the instanton solution

Thus, we expect a general trajectory to be composed of segments fluctuating around

fluctuate around the classicaf instanton. Figure 8.6 shows a segment of a typical

the number of instantons goes to Infinity, W"lhin a sectar of fixed instanton number, the sequenthai updating efficiently sums the local fluctuations around the classical

PATH INTEGRAL IN 600RDINATE REPRESEPJ1A"F"IQN
One obvious approach ta the many-particle prsblem is t o try to generalize the
methods of Section 8-3 to a Feynman path integrali for many particles. We begin by
considering the initial value random walk to calculate the ground state of a many-Efoson
system.
Recall that for a single particle in a potential, the filter e - B H ( p t s ) acts in the space
of all one particle states to select out the ground state, Furthermore, the ground state
wave function may be chosen positive so that $(c) may be sampled as a probability
distilbution Eq. (8.67) and the diRusion equation for $. Eq. (8.63) yields a positive
solution. In the many-particle case, e - f l H ( ~ z s . . ~s ~l ** - * z l )acts in the full space of

with spatial symmetry causes the lowest eigenstate of H to be totally symmetric with

a slgn change by interchanging particles a" and j may atso be reached in a series of
steps with no sign change in which i and g' simply circle around each other, This
digerence between one and higher dimensions reflects the fundamental digerence in

how nodal surfaces and the surfaies defined by antisymmetry depend on dimension.
In d dimension, the condition y$ (F1,F 2 . . ,Fm) = 0 defines a dra - L dimensional nodal
surf"ace, whereas antisymmetry specifies
constraints of the form Ti = 7;: corresponding to (dn - d ) dimendonal surfaces, Thus, for c% = 2, the dimensions of these
sudaces coincide, and antisymmetry alone can cornpletefy specify the nodal surFace
of the wave function, For higher dhension, however, the nodal sudaces have higher
dimension ( d z - 1) than the surfaces specifid by antisymmetry (Qn- n), so that antisymmetry alone cannot specify the nodal surfaces, For example, for two particles in
two dimensions wit h relative coordinate 7, antisymmetry of the relative wave function
$(if
= -$(-F)
only specifies a single point $(0) = 0, whereas the nodal surface is
a tine in the s; y plane passing through the origin. Hence, .For d > 1 antisymmetry
alone cannot uniquely specify a sector in which the wave function is posktive.
Whereas there i s no compfete solution to the sign problem for Fermbns in more
than one dimension, there are two useful strategies, One possibility is to fix the nodes
by selecting the best possible trial wave function and to perform a gu"red random walk
in which no particles are permitted to cross the nodal surfaces defined by the trial function. Within each region bounded by nodat suufaces, the problem is egectively Bosonic,
and the result is a variational calculation and upper bound an the energy corresponding to the best possible wave function with the specified nodes, A second possibility
is to perfarm a transient estimate starting with the best fixed-node distribution and
releasing the fixed-node restrictions. As paints cross nodes, canceilations willi give rise
t o statistkal errors which increase exponenthatry with evolutbn time while the system
retaxes to its ground state. The early stages of the relaxation may then be calculated
by using sumciently large sample size.

lem for many particle systems also arise when the global action is sampled. The
unrestricted trace Tk (Oe-pH) for a many-body system would average the observable
O over all Boson states, all Fermion states, and all unphysical mixed-symmetry states.
Hence, the only physical use of the easily evaluated unprojected trace is in the limit
p -) oo in which case it projects out the Boson ground state. To calculate true thermal
averages of proper statistics, one must sample an action in which one or more sets of
symmetrized or antisymmetrized states have been inserted. Using Eq. (8.72) at each
time step yields

for Bosons or Fermions, respectively, where Mnis the matrix defined in Eq. (8.72) for
the nth time slice, X: = S?, and N normalizes the probability. Since the permanent
in Eq. (8.74) is positive, thermal Boson averages may be sampled straightforwardly
in any dimension using the technique developed in Section 8.3. For Fermions. negative contributions of the determinant may also be avoided in the special case of one
dimension by working in the ordered subspace as before.
Finally, before considering alternative functional integrals for the many-body evolution operator, it is useful to note that the path integral Monte Carlo approach illustrated above for the case of N particles in coordinate representation may be applied
to a variety of other physical systems with many degrees of freedom. For example,
although the most common way of solving lattice gauge theories is to sample the global
tagmngian action using the Metropolis algorithm, one may also treat the Hamiltonian
form of lattice gauge theory as a many-body problem. The degrees of freedom are the
elements of a group defined in each of the finks of a lattice in cl spatial dimensions
(see. for example. Creutz. 1983). In the simple case of U(1). corresponding to quantum electrodynamics, a group element at a link originating at site n in direction k may
be written U = e i A k ( " ) and the resulting Harniltonian is

where B is the sum of the link variables around an elementary plaquette corresponding
to the lattice curl

and the commutation relations [Ak(n),
Note that conventional electrodynamics is recovered when the lattice spacing -+ 0 and
the *Ba term from the cosine dominates. Discrete U(1) lattice gauge theory thus
looks just like a many-body problem with coordinates xi replaced by compact variables
0 < Ak(n) < 27r and a four-body potential connecting links on common plaquettes.
The only difference relative to the evolution operator (8.70) arises from the kinetic term
for the compact variable A. which follows-by using a complete set of periodic states
(Aim} = eimA and the Poisson sum formula

fn the limit E -+ Q, the contrttbutions of the peViodic 'images outside the fundamental
interval [0,2~]
are exponentially suppressed, and the evolution for A is precisely the
familiar Gaussian difision encounter& in the many-body problem, The infinitesimal
evolution operator for non-Abellan groups has analogous structure. For example, in
the case of SU(2). group elements may be written in the form II = a01 i C:=, airi
where the ri denote Pauli matrices and the real coeficientr as satisfy C,!=,a; = 1 and
are thus constrained to the sudace of a three-sphere, In the limit E --,0,the kinetic
term becomes
ewhere AS is the distance between U(Z) and U(ii') and
produces Gaussran diRusion on the three-sphere,
The generalization of the potential term In (8.11'5) is the sum over all plaquettes
of ReTr(UfL"UU)where the product of' the U's is taken around each plaquette. Note
that this term stltl has the form of a four-body potent-"ral in the compact variables and
that Re(eiAeiAeiAeiA)
reproduces the cos B potential. (Eq. (8.75)) for U ( 1 ) . Further
details are provided by Chin e t a[, (1984, $9851. Vet another example of this path
integral Monte Carlo approach is the case of spin systems djscussed subsequently, En
which a random walk. in the space of continuous coordinates zi is replaced by a random

It is natural to ask whether any of the functional Integral representations of the
many-body evolution operator using fields are preferable t o the particle coordinate
path intelyrat for stochastic calculations. A prdori, it appears counterproductive ta
resort t o field variables instead of particle coordinates, shcc continuum fields must
be approximated on a discrete mesh, The field representatltion is thus no longer exact
in princbpte, and in arder to obtain reasonable accuracy, the number of degrees of
freedom required is immensely larger than the number of particte coordinates, Recall,
for example, the case of 208Pb at the beginning of Section 8.1,which for even moderate
lattice with 1
0
' degrees of freedom to descilbe the
accuracy would require a (100)~
physics of 6324 physical degrees of freedom, Hence, a functional integral over fields will
onfy be useful when it circumvents an othewise insurmountable problem, such as the
Fermian sign problem in mare than one d"rension.
Consweer First the possibility of sampling the action for the coherent state partition
function Eq. (2,601

where 4, is a complw variable or Grassmann number and a denotes the point of a
space-time lattice and any internal quantum numbers. For Bosons, the "ttegrand is
unavoidably complex, since even the one-body piece 4; (& - p T ) ~is w~n Wermitian, and one is thus confronted with the usual sign problem in sampling the real
part, Note that arthough the coherent slate path integral for Bosons i s farmafly similar

+

t o the field theory of a scalar field, only the fatter is suitable for Monte Carlo sampling
since the actbon for a scalar field may be written in terms of a real field (b and contains
the Hermitian contribution d,(& For Fermions. practical methods
have not been developed for Monte Carlo integration over Grassmann vaPiables. Recall,
for example, that a matrix representation of Grassmann numbers w"rh ra generators
requires
X Zn matulces..
Thus, in order t o obtain a suitable functional integral over field variables 1603 either
Basons or Fermions, it is necessary to introduce an auxilhry field and integrate out
the complex ar Grassmann variables 4, as in Chapter (7).

Note that in order for the Gaussian htegral over cr to converge, a15 the eigenvalues of
u must be negative so E
t may be necessavy to introduce a constant or diagonal shift in

the potential (see Sugiyama and Koonin, i1)86).
The essential question is when the resulthng determinant is positive so that the
action may be sampled without sign cancellations, Although positivlity is nag assured
in general, the integrand is positive?for one important class of problems: those in
which the potential is independent of an internal symmetry having an even number of
states, Consider the case of Eermlons with a spin Independent interaction and write
the space, time, and spin labels included in a explicitly 4, -- 4rn(zr7 ) . Then the
interaction is $ dz dzt C, 4;(z)b,(z)

Since Fermions have half-integer spins, only even powers 2S I of the determinant
arise and the inlegrand is positive, The same argument applies for any other internal

symmetries such as isaspin, eolor, or flavor and ground state properties for even numbers of Bosons may be obtained by treating them as Fermiions with spin degeneracy
M as in Section 3.1.
Once the partition function has been expressed as an integral over a,Eq, (8.791,
observabies are evaluated as the sum of contractions using Wick's theorem in the usual
way (sea Eq, (2.84)):

Note that even though [Det ~ ( o ) ] ' ~ ems(@)

is positive. the signs gP arising
in Wickas theorem may cause uncontrollable cancellation for some operatars. The
biggest practical problems in applying Eq. (8.80) are encountered in evaluating Det M
and M-'. The quantity ~ e t ~ ( ~ ) e - ~may

and (O\&l&) is a determinant of overlaps between the single-particle wave functions
in (41 and U,14), Again for spin-independent interactions, one obtains the overlap

8.5 SPIN SYSTEMS AND LATTICE FERMlOMS
Additional interesting possibillties arise in the stochastic solution of quantum spin
systems on a lattice and of closely related lattice Fermion models,
The magnetic properties of solids may be described by a quantum spin Hamiltonian
since the exchange interaction between electrons gives rise to an eRFective spin-spin
interaction (see. for example Ashcroft and Mermin. 1976). For illustrative purposes.
it suffices t o consider the simple case of the Weisenberg Hamiltonian for spin one-half
with nearest neighbor interactions

where poskllve S corresponds t o ferramagnetic coupling and the spin one-half operator
is wiltten in terms of the Pauli matrices Si = {Q:, or, of). Extension of the basic
ideas to anisotropic couplings, external fields, and higher spin is generally straightforward, and further details may be found in the review by Dettaedt and Lagendijk
(1985).
The connection in one dimension between lattkce spin Hamiltonians and lattice
ermion models, such as the Hubbard model (1963,1964) is seen by noticing that the
raising and lowering operators

behave nearly like Fernions. They have Fermlon commrrtat'ton relations on sites

but have Bosonic commutations retations between sites

True Fermion operatars may be constructed from the a's via the Jordan Wigner transformation
which inserts the requis2e minus signs by csunting the number of occupied sites to
the left of the it" site [see Problem 11). Thus, for example, we may rewrite a lattice
Fermion model as a spin $ model as follows

In general, except for technical details such as treating the Jordan Wigner phases
with periodic boundary conditions one may pass fi.eety between the spin and Fermian
language, and it i s often usefut t o think of the spin-projection representation as an
occupation number representation.

One alteunathe t o evaluate the evolution operator for spin systems is to use the
Trotter formula as we have for other path integrals (Suzuki, 1996). To break up the
evolution operator into a sequenw of infinitesimal steps which art? particularly easy t o
evaluate, "I i s useful to decompose the Hamittonian into sums of non-overlapping eel!
Mamittonians. To illustrate the decomposition, which may be performed for any lattice

the matrix elements in the transformed basis for q = -1. Since

write

where == 1 for a ferrornagnet and q -- -1 for an antikrromagnet. The explicit q
dependence af the diagonal matrix etements contains the physical digerence between
quantum ferromagnets and antiferramagnets. Note that in contrast to the Fermion sign
problem which was cured only in one spatial dimension, the sublattice transformation
has efiminated minus signs for bipartite lattkes of any spatial dhmensian. For other
antiferromagnetic probfems, however, such as the triangular lattice which is important because it is the simplest example of frustrated spins and the problem of ciclic
exchanges in solid 'He. the minus signs cannot be removed completely.
When the trace of the evolution operator i s evaluated instead of a spec"tfic matdx
element as in Eq. (8,873, one must again address the prohiem oF trapping in a restricted

of fixed total spin projection (or total Fermion number) since lir commutes with S,.
In order to sampie the Full space, microreverslble global moves must also Be included
which offer the possiglity of adding or removing an entire world line. For Fermions with
periodic boundary conditions, which may be represented by world tines on a torus, one
must simHariy allow for transitions between configurations of diflertlrnt winding number
n, where n is the number of times a point on a world tine must circle the torus before
returning to its original position.

SPECIAL METHODS FOR SPtFJS

A method by Hanrcomb (1962)exploits the special properties of spin algebra
to avoid the Finite E errors inherent in path integrals and represents the thermal trace
as an exact average. Using Eq, (8,881, the MamiltonIan may be rewritten as Ii =

For an antiferromagnet. Eq. (8.93) is unsuitable as it stands, since each odd term

for a biparticle lattice, Ignoring irrelevant constants, the partition function for J < 0
may be expanded as follows

where 0 = h:$ or -hij. Since only closed loops with an even number of h. *S contribute or equivalentty by virtue of the sublattice transformation, all Cars yield positive
contributions and the evaluation of thermal expectation values and the random walk in
the space of operator sequences C, proceeds as before.
Another novel feature of spin and lattice Fermion systems is the possibility of
using a discrete rather than continuous auxiliary field. If some operator A can only
assume a finite set of discrete values, it is always possible t o replace the integral over
a continuous auxiliary variable in the Hubbard Stratanovich transformation e t b A z =

This discrete lsing auxiliary field has been used by Hirsch (1983. 1984) to replace the

When the Fermion trace is taken over the one-body operator. the resulting lsing action

to a broad range of quantum systems involving many degrees of freedom, including
both many-particle systems and field theories. Although it is impractkal t o provide an

which arise for krmions in one spatial dimendon, particular attention has been devoted
t o one-dimensional models such as a potential model for nuclei (Negete, 1979),mesonnucleon field theory (Serot e t al. 1983). a quark model of hadronic matter (Horowitz

a) The principal practical problem in real calculations is establishing credible error
estimates. To illustrate the essential i~sues,Monte Carlo results from studying a
many-l"ermion system ia one dimension (Negele 1979,1985) are shown in the Bgure.
To use &s. (8.12- 8.13) for the statistical emor, we must know how many steps of
the fitropcrlis atgoritbrn or applications of
arc? required to obtain statistically
independent samples. Hence, if Oi denotes the it" sample of some observable (Q),
it is useful to calculate the autocorrelation function,

Oi Oi+*. Figure (a) shows the autocorrelation functions
where ((Oi Oi+k)) E
for the enttrgy and density. Explain why these are different and haw often to sample
each. for independent results. Xf a calculation had not yet equilibrated, how might
this lack of equilibrium show up in the autocorrelation function? Suppose one uses
Eq, (8.55) t a cafcutate an observrtBIe by averaging over the complete time mesh.
Are observable8 on; adjacent time slices correlated? How would you take this into
account in est ablishlng errors?
b) Figure (bf shows the mean value of the energy obtained by s t a t i n g with
our initial configuration, sampling the energy and variance every (m)'" update and
averaging fn) such, samples to obtain the energy and error bars shown. At what
point has the energy equilibrated? Are the emar bars past that point ststisticicalj.y
sensible? Suggest several ways to check the equilibration and error estimates.

two-body Jastrow correlation factors xnultiplying a Slater determinant, Explain the
expected dependence on AT for each energy and comment on the magnitude of the
A7 dependence, If this characteristic scale of variation of u is of the order of 0.2 (in
units where h = m = I), explain the value of AT at which you expect cansergeace

simple model or physical system. For those inexperienced in numerical calculations,
an ideal starting point is povided by the H - molecule. The calculation is described
