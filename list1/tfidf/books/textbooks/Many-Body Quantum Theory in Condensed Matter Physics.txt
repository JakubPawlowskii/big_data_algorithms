PREFACE
This introduction to many-body quantum theory in condensed m atter physics has
emerged from a set of lecture notes used in our courses Afany-particlc Physics I and
II for graduate and advanced undergraduate students at the Niels Bohr Institute,
University of Copenhagen, held six times between 1999 and 2004. The notes have also
been used twice in the course Transport in Nanostructures taught at the Technical
University of Denmark. The courses have been followed by students of both theoretical
and experimental physics and it is our experience th at both groups have benefited
from the notes. The theory students gained a good background for further studies,
while the experimental students obtained a familiarity with theoretical concepts they
encounter in research papers.
We have gone through the trouble of w riting this textbook, because we felt the
pedagogical need for putting an emphasis on the physical contents and applications of
the machinery of quantum field theory without loosing mathematical rigor. We hope
we have succeeded, a t least to some extent, in reaching this goal.
Since our main purpose is to provide a pedagogical introduction, and not to present
a review of the physical examples presented, we do not give comprehensive references
to these topics. Instead, we refer the reader to the review papers and topical books
mentioned in the text and in the bibliography.
We would like to thank our ever enthusiastic students for their valuable help
throughout the years improving the notes preceding this book.

The book has been corrected for an. unfortunately, rather large number of mis­
prints. We would like to thank all the colleagues and readers who have sent corrections
to us and in particular the many students and the teachers of the courses Condensed
Matter Theory I a t University of Copenhagen and Transport in nanostructures at
the Technical University of Denmark for helping in locating the misprints. We haw
not made major changes to the book other th an Section 10.5 has been rewritten
somewhat.

FIRST AND SECOND QUANTIZATION

Quantum theory is the most complete microscopic theory we have today describing the
physics of energy and m atter. It has successfully been applied to explain phenomena
ranging over many orders of magnitude, from the study of elementary particles on
the sub-nucleonic scale to the study of neutron stars and other astrophysical objects
on the cosmological scale. Only the inclusion of gravitation stands out as an unsolved
problem in fundamental quantum theory.
Historically, quantum physics first dealt only with the quantization of the motion
of particles, leaving the electromagnetic field classical, hence the name quantum me­
chanics. Later also the electromagnetic field was quantized, and even the particles
themselves became represented by quantized fields, resulting in the development of
quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum field theory (QFT) in general. By con­
vention, the original form of quantum mechanics is denoted first quantization, while
quantum field theory is formulated in the language of second quantization.
Regardless of the representation, be it first or second quantization, certain basic
concepts are always present in the formulation of quantum theory. The starting point
is the notion of quantum states and the observables of the system under consideration.
Quantum theory postulates th at all quantum states are represented by state vectors in
a Hilbert space, and th at all observables are represented by Hermitian operators acting
on th at space. Parallel state vectors represent the same physical state, and therefore
one mostly deals w ith normalized state vectors. Any given Hermitian operator A has
a number of eigenstates |^ Q) th at are left invariant by the action of the operator
up to a real scale factor a, i.e., A\ij>a) = a |^ Q). The scale factors are denoted the
eigenvalues of the operator. It is a fundamental theorem of Hilbert space theory that
the set of all eigenvectors of any given Hermitian operator forms a complete basis
set of the Hilbert space. In general, the eigenstates |i/>Q) and \<fe ) of two different
Hermitian operators A and B are not the same. By measurement of the type B the
quantum state can be prepared to be in an eigenstate |<£ } of the operator B . This
state can also be expressed as a superposition of eigenstates |^»Q) of the operator A
as |<$ ) = Y a
. If one measures the dynamical variable associated with the
operator A in this state, one cannot in general predict the outcome with certainty.
It is only described in probabilistic terms. The probability of having any given |t/>Q)
as the outcome is given as the absolute square \C@ |2 of the associated expansion
coefficient. This non-causal element of quantum theory is also known as the collapse
of the wavefunction. However, between collapse events the tim e evolution of quantum
states is perfectly deterministic. The time evolution of a state vector |t^(t)) is governed
by the central operator in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian H (the operator
associated with the total energy of the system), through Schrodinger’s equation 1

Each state vector |V>) is associated with an adjoint state vector (IV7))* = {V'|- One
can form inner products, “bra(c)kets” , (tfr|0) between adjoint “bra" states (V»| and
"ket" states |d). and use standard geometrical terminology: c.g.. the norm squared

If {|tf»Q)} is an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, then the above-mentioned
expansion coefficient C# is found by forming inner products:
= (tb0 |£ ). A
further connection between the direct and the adjoint Hilbert space is given by the
relation (tf>|0) = (^|0)*, which also leads to the definition of adjoint operators. For
a given operator A the adjoint operator A* is defined by demanding (t>|At|0) =
for any |^} and |<i).
In this diapter, we will briefly review standard first quantization for one- and
many-particle systems. For more complete reviews the reader is referred to standard
textbooks by, for instance, Dirac (1989). Landau and Lifshitz (1977), and Merzbacher
(1970). Based on this we will introduce second quantization. This introduction, how­
ever, is not complete in all details, and we refer the interested reader to the textbooks
by Malian (1990), Fetter and Walecka (1971), and Abrikosov et al. (1975).

For simplicity consider a non-relativistic particle, say an electron with charge - e ,
moving in an external electromagnetic field described by the potentials <p(r, t) and
A (r,t). The corresponding Hamiltonian is

> = i ( i , ' t ' 4 ( r ' l))

(1-2)

An eigenstate describing a free spin-up electron traveling inside a box of volume V
can be written as a product of a propagating plane wave and a spin-up spinor. Using
the Dirac notation the state ket can be written as | ^ j ) = |k»t)> where one simply
lists the relevant quantum numbers in the ket. The state function (also denoted the
wave function) and the ket are related by
tfVo(r) = <r|k, <r) = J p eik r x«r

(free particle orbital).

(1.3)

i.e., by the inner product of the position bra (r| with the state ket.
The plane wave representation |k,<r) is not always a useful starting point for
calculations. For example in atomic physics, where electrons orbiting a point-like
positively charged nucleus are considered, the hydrogenie eigenstates |n,/,m ,<r) are
much more useful. Recall th at
{r \n ,l,m ,o ) = Rni{r)Yi'm(0,<f>)x„

(hydrogen orbital),

(1.4)

where Rni(r) is a radial Coulomb function with n - l nodes, while Yi,m(0,<f>) is a
spherical harmonic representing angular momentum I with a z component m.
A third example is an electron moving in a constant magnetic field B = B e * ,
which in the Landau gauge A = x B e y leads to the Landau eigenstates \n ,k v>kz,ff),

where n is an integer, k y (Jt*) is the y ( 2 ) component of k, and a the spin variable.
Recall that
( r |n ,k„,k„(7) =

where t = y /h /c B is the magnetic length and Hn is th e normalized Hermite polynomial of order n associated with the harmonic oscillator potential induced by the
magnetic field. Examples of each of these three types of electron orbitals are shown
in Fig. 1.1.
In general a complete set of quantum numbers is denoted v . The three examples
given above correspond to u = (kx , k y,k z ,a ), v =
and v = (n ,k y ,k t ,<r),
each yielding a state function of the form ^ „ (r) = (r|i/). The completeness of a l>asis
state as well as the normalization of the state vectors plays a central role in quan­
tum theory. Loosely speaking, the normalization condition means th at with proba­
bility unity a particle in a given quantum state 0 „ (r) must be somewhere in space:
/ d r |ti>„(r)|2 = 1, or in the Dirac notation: 1 = / d r (i/|r)(r|t/) = (i/| ( / d r |r)(r|) |i>).
From this we conclude
/ * |r > ( r |= l .

(1.6)

Similarly, the completeness of a set of basis states ^ „ (r) means th at if a particle is in
some state 0 (r) it must be found with probability unity within the orbitals of the basts
Bet:
|(*'|V')|2 = 1. Again using the Dirac notation we find 1 = £ „ (0 |* /)(*/|^’) =
(t/>| ( £ „ |i/)(i/|)
and we conclude
I> )M

(1-7)

We shall often use the completeness relation (1.7). A simple example is the expansion
of a state function in a given basis: ^ (r ) = ( r|^ ) = (r|l|d>) = (r| ( £ „ |t')(*/|) |V>) =
5Z1z(r|i/)(i/|t/»), which can be expressed as

It should he noted that the quantum label v can contain both discrete and con­

bination of both summations and integrations. For example, in the case in Eq. (1.5)

F irst quan tization, m any-particle sy stem s

When turning to JV-particle systems, i.e., systems containing JV identical particles,
say. electrons, three more assumptions are added to the basic assumptions defining
quantum theory. The first assumption is the natural extension of the single-particle
state function 0 (r), which (neglecting the spin degree of freedom for the tim e being)
is a complex ware function in 3-dimensional space, to the jY-particle state function
V>(r,.r2. . . . .r^r), which is a complex function in the 3Ar-dimensional configuration
space. As for one particle, this JV-particle state function is interpreted as a probability
amplitude such th at its absolute square is related to a probability:

i(r1,r 2, . . . , r /v)|2 f j d r j =

FIRST QUANTIZATION, MANY-PARTICLE SYSTEMS

1.2.1

Permutation symmetry and indistinguishability

A fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics concerns the con­
cept of indistinguishability of identical particles. In classical mechanics each particle
can be equipped with an identifying marker (e.g. a colored spot on a billiard ball)
without influencing its behavior, and moreover it follows its own continuous path in
phase space. Thus, in principle, each particle in a group of identical particles can be
identified. This is not so in quantum mechanics. Not even in principle is it possible
to mark a particle without influencing its physical state, and worse, if a number of
identical particles are brought to the same region in space, their wavefunctions will
rapidly spread out and overlap with one another, thereby soon rendering it impossible
to say which particle is where.
The second fundamental assumption for iV-particle systems is therefore th a t iden­
tical particles, i.e., particles characterized by the same quantum numbers such as
mass, charge and spin, are in principle indistinguishable.
From the indistinguishability of particles it follows th at if two coordinates in an
iV-particle state function are interchanged the same physical state results, and the
corresponding state function can a t most differ from the original one by a simple
prefactor A. If the same two coordinates then are interchanged a second time, we end
up with the exact same state function,
W

' l . r ,," ,r t , ..,!> ) = X i/i(r11..,r t ! .,,rj ,..,r „ )
= -*2<Mri,-.,r,-,

(1.15)

and we conclude th at A2 = 1, or A = ±1. Only two species of particles are thus
possible in quantum physics, the so-called bosons and fermions:1
^ ( r n .. ■,rJ t . . . , rk, . . . , t n ) = +ip(rl , .

r fcl. . . , r j , . . . . r w)

= -ip (r l t . . . ^ . . . . r j v )

(bosons),

(1.16a)

(fermions). (1.16b)

The importance of the assumption of indistinguishability of particles in quantum
physics cannot be exaggerated, and it has been introduced due to overwhelming exper­
imental evidence. For fermions it immediately leads to the Pauli exclusion principle,
stating th at two fermions cannot occupy the same state, because if in Eq. (1.16b) we
let Tj- — rk then ip = 0 follows. It thus explains the periodic table of the elements,
and consequently the starting point in our understanding of atomic physics, con­
densed m atter physics, and chemistry. It furthermore plays a fundamental role in the
studies of the nature of stars and of scattering processes in high energy physics. For
bosons, the assumption is necessary to understand Planck’s radiation law for the elec­
tromagnetic field, and spectacular phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation,
superfluidity, and laser fight.
1This discrete permutation symmetry is always obeyed. However, some quasiparticles in 2D ex­
hibit any phase e*^, a so-called Berry phase, upon adiabatic interchange; they are therefore called
anyons.

FIRST AND SECOND QUANTIZATION

1.2.2

The single-particle states as basis states

We now show th at the basis states for the iV-particle system can be built from any
complete orthonormal single-particle basis {^„(r)},
£ > ; t r ') 'W r ) = 4( r - « / ).

y * « (r)^ (r) = W .

(117)

Starting from an arbitrary JV-partick state ^ ( r ,, — rN ) we form the (JV -l)-partick
function A„, (r2, . . . , r N ) by projecting on to the baas s tate t ( r , ):
A„(.rt ........r K) S / * , * . ( r ^ r , ............................................r » ) . (1.18)
This can be inverted by multiplying with

and smnming over iq,

, r 2l. . . , r,v) = 5 3 Vv,(*i)A., ( r j,.. ■,r» ).

(1.19)

Now define, analogously, A VuU2 (**3, . . . , r N) from A„x(r2, . . . , r N):
A « ,n ( r 3....... r jv) =
As before, we can invert this expression to give A„, in terms of A„,
insertion into Eq. (1.19) leads to

(1.20)
, which upon

<f>(ri,r2, r 3 . ..,!■«) = 5 2 i:n { iiW ^ ( T 2 )A n ,„ (r 3........!•„).

(1.21)

Continuing all the way through r n (and then writing r instead of r) we end up with
H r , , r 2........r „ ) =

£
4 - . . » . . - ^ » ^ ( r i ) A , ( r a) ...iS M, ( r K),

(1.22)

where A„, ^ ....VN are just complex numbers. Thus any A -partick state function can
be written as a (rather complicated) linear superposition of product states containing
N factors of single-particle basis states.
Even though the product states
^ ( r ^ ) , in a mathematical sense, form a
perfectly valid basis for the A-particle Hilbert space, we know- from the discussion on
indistinguishahility th at physically it is not a useful basis since the coordinates have to
appear in a symmetric way. No physical perturbation can ever break the fundamental
fermion or boson symmetry, which therefore ought to be explicitly incorporated in
the basis states. The symmetry' requirements from Eqs. (1.16a) and (1.16b) are in
Eq. (1.22) hidden in the coefficients A Vl, . A physical meaningful basis bringing

Operators in first quantization

We now turn to the third assumption needed to complete the quantum theory of
A-particle systems. It states that single- and few-particle operators defined for singleand few-particle states remain unchanged when acting on JY-particle states. In this
hook we will only work with one- and two-particle operators.
Let us hogin with one-particle operators. A given local one-particle operator T =
T(r, V r ), say the kinetic energy operator or an external potential, takes the following

FIRST AND SECOND QUANTIZATION

Many-particlc physics is formulated in terms of the so-called second quantization
representation also known by the more descriptive name occupation number repre­
sentation. The starting point of this formalism is the notion of indistinguishahility
of particles discussed in Section 1.2.1 combined with the observation in Section 1.2.2
th at determinants or permanents of single-particle states form a basis for the Hilbert
space of iV-partick1states. As we shall see. quantum theory can be formulated in terms
of occupation numbers of these single-particle states.
1.3.1

The occupation number representation

The first step in defining the occupation number representation is to choose any
ordered and complete single-particle basis
\vt), |ia»), . . t he ordering being of
paramount importance for fermions. Prom the form S ± il>Vnt (ri)t/)Vj>j(r2) . . .
of the basis states in Eq. (1.26), it is clear th at in each term only the occupied
single-particle Btates \vn}) play a role. It must somehow be simpler to formulate a
representation where one just counts how many particles there are in each orbital |i/).
This simplification is achieved with the occupation number representation.
The basis states for an JV-particle system in the occupation number representation
are obtained simply by listing the occupation numbers of each basis state,
JV-particle basis states:

\nVl, n„a, n„a, .. .) ,

^

n U) = JV.

(1.35)

It is therefore natural to define occupation number operators n„ which as eigen­
states have the basis states \nVj), and as eigenvalues have the number n V] of particles
occupying the state i / j ,
K, k>) =
k » )(i.36)
We shall show later that for fermions n Vj can be 0 or 1, while for bosons it can be
any non-negative number,
_ J 0 ,1

(fermions),
(bosons).

..

Naturally, the question arises how to connect the occupation number basis Eq. (1.35)
with the first quantization basis Eq. (1-24). This will be answered in the next section.
The space spanned by the occupation number basis, denoted the Pock space
is
defined as F =

In Table 1.1 some of the fermionic and bosonic basis states in the occupation num)>er
representation are shown. Note how by virtue of the direct sum, states containing a
different number of particles are defined to be orthogonal.
1.3.2

The boson creation and annihilation operators

To connect first and second quantization we first treat bosons. Given the occupation
number operator it is natural to introduce the creation operator
th at raises the
occupation number in the state |i/j) by 1,

The creation and annihilation operators b ^ and bUj are the fundamental operators in
the occupation number formalism. As we will demonstrate later any operator can be
expressed in terms of them.
Let us proceed by investigating the properties of 6^ and b ^ further. Since bosons
arc symmetric in the single-particle state index Vj we of course demand th at bjrj
and blk must commute, and hence by Hermitian conjugation th at also 6„ and
commute. The commutator [A, B] for two operators A and B is defined as
[A,B] = A B - B A ,

so th at

[A,B] = 0

=>

BA = AB.

(1.40)

We demand further that if j ± k then bUj and b]^ commute. However, if j = k we must
be careful. It is evident th at since an unoccupied state can not be emptied further
we must demand bVj | . . . ,0 ,. .. ) = 0, i.e., B_(0) = 0. We also have the freedom to
normalize the operators by demanding &J, | . . . , 0 ,...) = | . . . , 1 ,...) , i.e., B+ (0) = 1.

we have [bUj, 6^ } |0) = |0). We now define this commutation relation to be valid as an
operator identity in general and below derive the consequences of this construction.
In summary, we define the operator algebra for the bosonic creation and annihilation
operators by the following three commutation relations:

By definition 6* and

is, and by
using the operator algebra Eq. (1.41) we show below' th at this operator in fact is the

two very im portant commutation relations:
[bibu, bv] = -b y ,

[btby, 6+] =

(1.42)

Second, for any state \<f>) we note th at {<j>\bpty\<f>) is the norm of the state by\(f>) and
hence a positive real number (unless \<j>) = |0), for which 6„|0) = 0). Let |<fo) be any
eigenstate of b^by, i.e., blbu \<f>\) = \\<j>\) with A > 0. Nowr choose a particular Ao and
study by\<f>\0).We find that

(btby)by\(j>Xa)= (bybt ~ l)by^) = by^yby ~ l ) ^ ) = by^ ~ l ) ^ ) ,

(1.43)

i.e., by\<}>\0) is also an eigenstate of
bu t with the eigenvalue reduced by 1 to
(Ao — 1). As illustrated in Fig. 1.3, if Ao is not a non-negative integer this lowering
process can continue until a negative eigenvalue is encountered, but this violates the
condition Ao > 0, and we conclude th a t A = n — 0 ,1 ,2 ,__ Writing |<fo) = |” i/) we

But to maintain the fundamental fermionic antisymmetry upon exchange of orbitals,
apparent in Eq. (1.24), it is not sufficient in the fermionic case ju st to list the occu­
pation numbers of the states, also the order of the occupied states has a meaning. We
must therefore demand
|

and consequently we must have th at c\tj and cj,k anti-commute, and hence, by Hermi­
tian conjugation, th a t also cV} and cVk anti-commute. The anti-commutator (A, B]
for two operators A and B is defined as
{ A ,B } = A B -\-B A ,

so th at

{A, i ? } = 0

=>

B A = —A B .

(1.51)

For j ^ k we also demand th a t q , and cj,t anti-commute. However, if j = k we
again m ust be careful. It is evident th a t since an unoccupied state can not be emptied
further we must demand c„ | . . . , 0 ,...) = 0, i.e., C_(0) -- 0. We also have the freedom
to normalize the operators by demanding cj, | . . . ,0 ,. .. ) = | . . . , 1 ,...) , i.e., C+ (0) —

C_{1) = 1.
It is clear th at cV) and <AVJ do not anti-commute: cV} |0) = |0) while
cVj |0) = 0,
i.e., we have {cV], } |0) = |0). We now define this commutation relation to be valid as
an operator identity in general and below derive the consequences of this construction.
In summary, we define the operator algebra for the fermionic creation and annihilation
operators by the following three anti-commutation relations:

The general form fo r second quantization operators

In second quantization all operators can be expressed in term s of the fundamental cre­
ation and annihilation operators defined in the previous two sections. This rewriting
of the first quantized operators in Exp. (1.29) and (1.32) into their second quantized
form is achieved by using the basis state identities (1.47) and (1.57) linking the two
representations.
For simplicity, let us first consider the single-particle operator Ttol from Eq. (1.29)
acting on a Irosonic JV-particle system. In this equation we then act with the bosonic
symmetrization operator S+ on both sides. Utilizing th at Ttot and S+ commute and
invoking the basis state identity (1.47) we obtain

where, on the right-hand side of the equation, the operator
stands on the site
rij. To make the kets on the two sides of the equation look alike, we would like to
reinsert the operator 6*n a t the site rij on the right. To do this we focus on the state
v = vnj- Originally, i.e., on the left-hand side, the state u may appear, say. p times
leading to a contribution (6j,)J*|0)- We h aw p > 0. since otherwise both sides would
yield zero. On the right-hand side the corresponding contribution has changed into
6^(&£)*■*|0). This is then rewritten by use of Eqs. (1.41), (1.46a) and (1.46b) as
i ^ r ' i o ) = 4 j , ( l M i ) ( f i J r 'i o > = ( b u ) < i i m -

Now, the p operators 6J, can be redistributed to their original places as they appear on
the left-hand side of Eq. (1.58). The sum over j together w ith 6VaVn yields p identical
contributions cancelling the factor 1/p in Eq. (1.59), and we arrive a t the simple result

It is straightforward to generalize this result to two-particle (or any-numl»er-ofparticle) operators acting on boson states, and a similar reasoning can be made for
the fermion case (see Exercise 1.1) when the necessary care is taken regarding the
sign appearing from the anti-commutators in this case. If we let a* denote either a
boson operator 6* or a fermion operator c* we can state the general form for one- and

which is extremely important in the case of two-particle fermion operators. The first

r through any of the basis states t)„(r). Since 4»+(r) and 4*(r) are second quantization
operators defined in every point in space they are called quantum field operators. From

FIRST AND SECOND QUANTIZATION

In some sense the quantum field operators express the essence of the wave/particle
duality in quantum physics. On the one hand they are defined as fields, like waves, hut
on the other hand they exhibit the commutator properties associated with particles.
The introduction of quantum field operators makes it easy to write down opera­
tors in the real space representation. By applying the definition (1.69) to the second
quantized single-particle operator of Eq. (1.61) one obtains

(1.71)

So, in the real space representation, i.e., using quantum field operators, operators in
second quantization have a form analogous to m atrix elements in first quantization.
Finally, when working with homogeneous systems it is often desirable to transform
between the real space and the momentum representations, i.e., to perform a Fourier
transformation. Substituting in Eq. (1.69) the \$v) basis with the momentum basis

The excitation of the harmonic oscillator can thus be interpreted as filling the oscilla­
tor with bosonic quanta created by the operator a*. This picture is particularly useful
in the studies of the photon and phonon fields, as we shall see throughout the book.
If we as a measure of the amplitude of the oscillator in the state |n) with n quanta
use th e square-root of the expectation value of x 2 = l 2(a*a* + a*a 4- a a f 4- aa)/2 , we
find y/(n|x3|n) = \ / n 4 -1/2 t. Thus the width of the oscillator wavefunction scales
roughly with the square-root of the number of quanta in the oscillator, as sketched in
Fig. 1.7.

functions \i'„(x) of the oscillator starting from the groundstate wavefunction vi>0(x):

1.4.2 The electromagnetic field in second quantization
Historically, the electromagnetic field was the first example of second quantization.
The quantum nature of the radiation field, and the associated concept of photons
play a crucial role in the theory7 of interactions between m atter and light. In the
applications in this book we shall, however, treat th e electromagnetic field classically.
The quantization of the electromagnetic field is based on the observation th at the
cigenmodes of the classical field can be thought of as a collection of harmonic os­
cillators. These are then quantized. In the free field case the electromagnetic field is
completely determined by the vector potential A (r, t) in a specific gauge. Tradition­
ally, the transversality condition V -A = 0 is chosen, in which case A is denoted the
radiation field, and we have

Eq. (1.78) we can express H in terms of the radiation field A,
H = ^ / * ( t „ | E | 2 + ^ | B | 2) .

Operators fo r kinetic energy, spin, density and current

In the following we establish the second quantization representation of the four im­
portant single-particle operators associated with kinetic energy, spin, particle density,
and particle current density.
First, we study the kinetic energy operator T, which is independent of spin and
hence diagonal in the spin indices. In first quantization it has the representations

The second equality can also be proven directly by inserting $ t ( r ) and <P(r) from
Eq. (1.72). For particles with charge q, a magnetic field can be included in the
expression for the kinetic energy by substituting the canonical momentum p with the
kinetic momentum4 p —qA,
4In analytical mechanics A enters through the Lagrangian: L = | m i ’2 — V + qv A , since this by
the Euler-Lagrange equations yields the Lorentz force. But then p = OL/dv = m v 4- qA, and by
means of a Legendre transform we get H(r,p) = p v — L(r ,v ) = §m «2 + V = ^ ( p — qA)2+ V.
Considering infinitesimal variations <$Awe get SH = H(A+SA) —H(A) = -qv-SA= —qfdr3 SA,

Next, we treat the spin operator s for electrons. In first quantization it is given

(1.92b)
We then turn to the particle density operator p (r). In first quantization the fun­
damental interpretation of the wave function ^ M<J(r) gives us pflt0(r) = |V>„ff(r)|a
which can also be written as p ^ a {r ) = f d r ' t^* a (r')S(r' - r ) ^ ^ ( r ') , and thus the
density operator for spin a is given by pa {r) = 6 ( 1^ - r). In second quantization this
combined with Eq. (1.61) yields
P .(r ) = J d r 1 *t(r')<S(r' - r ) * , ^ ) = * + (r)* „ (r).

(1.94)
where the momentum transfer q = k! —k has been introduced. The explicit expression
for the Fourier transform p„(q) of pCT(r) is
p .(q ) = 5 ^ o L < ‘k+w,k

The fourth and last operator to be treated is the particle current density operator
J(r). It is related to the particle density operator p (r) through the continuity equation
dtp + V -J = 0. This relationship can be used to actually define J . However, we shall
take a more general approach based on analytical mechanics, see Eq. (1.90) and the
associated footnote. This allows us in a simple way to take the magnetic field, given

by the vector potential A, into account. By analytical mechanics it is found that
variations SH in the Hamiltonian function due to variations &A in the vector potential
is given by
SH = - q J d T ] - S A .

(1.96)

We use this expression with H given by the kinetic energy Eq. (1.90). Variations due
to a varying param eter are calculated as derivatives if the param eter appears as a
simple factor. Expanding the square in Eq. (1.90) and writing only the A-dependent
terms of the integrand, —
+ A-V]\kff(r) + ^ A 2'&£(r)\k(T(r). reveals
one term where V is acting on A. By partial integration this V is shifted to ® t(r),
and we obtain
H = T + £ / * { — 7 A . [ ( v * t ( r ) ) * „ ( r ) - t J w ( V 4 '„ ( r ) ) ] + ^ A 2>llt(r)fl/„(r)}.
(1.97)
The variations of Eq. (1.96) can in Eq. (1.97) be performed as derivatives and J
is immediately read off as the prefactor to SA . The two terms in the current den­
sity operator are denoted the paramagnetic and the diamagnetic term, J v and J ' 1,
respectively:

The Coulomb interaction in second quantization

The Coulomb interaction operator V is a two-particle operator not involving spin,
and is thus diagonal in the spin indices of the particles. Using the same reasoning

Basis states fo r systems with different kinds o f particles

In the previous sections we have derived different fermion and boson operators. But
so far we have not treated systems where different kinds of particles are coupled. In
this book one important example of such a system is the fermionic electrons in a
metal interacting w ith the bosonic lattice vibrations (phonons). We study this system
in Chapter 3. Another example is electrons interacting with the photon field. Here
we will briefly clarify how to construct the basis set for such composed systems in
general.
Let us for simplicity just study two different kinds of particles. The arguments are
easily generalized to include more complicated systems. The starting point is the case
where the two kinds of particles do not interact with each other. Let the first kind
of particles be described by the Hamiltonian H x and a complete set of basis states
Likewise we have H 2 and {|/z)} for the second kind of particles. For the two
decoupled systems an example of separate occupation number basis sets is

1.5 S e c o n d q u a n tiz a tio n a n d s ta tis tic a l m ech an ics
The basic conjecture of statistical mechanics is th at our ignorance about a system is
best described by the following assumption: all states th at comply with a given set of
external constraints, e.g., have a definite total energy, are equally likely.6 Furthermore,
to give a meaningful definition to the term “all states", ergodicity is assumed. The
ergodic assumption states th at, as tim e evolves, a system visits all allowed states
complying with the constraints. The tim e it takes for the system to visit all of the
allowed phase space is the ergodicity time, which is assumed to be smaller than typical
time scales of the observation.
Suppose we are interested in some small system connected to the outside world,
the so-called reservoir, and assume th at, taken as a whole, they constitute a closed
system with total energy E t - Let us call th e energy of the small system Ea and th at
of the reservoir E r, i.e., E t = E a + E r. Based on the ergodicity assumption it is
natural to conjecture th at the probability for a subsystem to have a definite energy
E B is proportional to the number of ways th at the subsystem can have th at energy.
The density of states is defined as d(E ) = d N (E )/d E , where N (E ) is the number of
st ates with energy less than E . We denote the density of states of the total system a t a
given total energy d(E r)- while the small system and the reservoir have the densities
of states dg(Eg) and dr(Er), respectively. Since for a given small energy interval A E
the number of states in the reservoir is much larger than the number of states in the
smaller subsystem, the total density of states is dominated by th at of the reservoir
and hence d (E r) » dr(Er). The probability P (E g) for the subsystem to have energy
E b then follows from our fundamental assumption, namely th a t it is proportional to
the number of reservoir states th a t have Et — E„, thus
P [E a) oc dr {E r - Eg) A E .

(1.109)

Now, we do not expect this probability to be dependent on the size of the reservoir,
i.e., if we make it smaller by cutting it in two by some wall, nothing should happen
to the state of the small system, provided of course th at it is still much smaller than
the new reservoir. This means th a t if we consider the ratio of two probabilities
P (E a) _ d r(E r - Eg)
P{E'a)
d r(E r - E ’g )'

(1.110)

it must only depend on the energies E a and E'a and neither on the total energy E t nor
on dr. Furthermore, because the energy is only defined up to an additive constant, it
aThis is consistent with a kinetic model w'here transitions between the different states are included.

If a particular state is seldom visited, it also takes a long time to leave the state. Likewise, if there
is large transition rate for going to particular state, there is also a large rate for leaving it. The net
result is thus that the average time spend in a state is the same for all states.

is

We have thus arrived a t the famous Boltzmann or Gibbs distribution, which of course
should he normalized. In conclusion: from statistical mechanics we know th at for
both classical and quantum mechanical systems th at are connected to a heat hath
the probability for a given state s with energy E , to be occupied is determined by

wherq? = 1 /ik ^ T ) is the inverse tem perature and where the normalization factor Z
is the partition function

(1.114)

When we sum over states, we must sum over a set of states which cover the entire
space of possible states, i.e. the basis set th at we use to compute the energy must be a
complete set. For a quantum system with many particles, the states s arc, as we have
seen, in general quite complicated to write down, and it is therefore an advantage to
have a form which is independent of the choice of basis states. Also for a quantum
system it is not clear what is meant by the energy of a given state, unless of course it
is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, the only meaningful interpretation of
Eq. (1.114) is that the sum of states runs over eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Using
the l>asis states \v) defined by
H \v) = E„\v),
(1.115)
it is now quite natural to introduce the so-called density m atrix operator p corre­
sponding to the classical Boltzmann factor e~& E.
p = ed 11 = Y . W * * E~ H

(1.116)

We can thus write the expression Eq. (1.114) for the partition function as
z = J > le M = ® W

(1.117)

Likewise, the therm al average of any quantum operator A is easily expressed using
the density m atrix p. Following the elementary definition, we have

28

FIRST AND SECOND QUANTIZATION

Eqs. (1.117) and (1.118) are basis-independent expressions, since the sum over
states is identified with the trace operation.7 This is of course tru e whatever formalism
we use to evaluate the trace. In first quantization the trace runs over for example the
determinant basis, which in second quantization translates to the Fock space of the
corresponding quantum numbers. For the canonical ensemble the trace is however
restricted to run over states with a given number of particles.
For the grand canonical ensemble the number of particles is not conserved. The
small system is allowed to exchange particles with the reservoir while keeping its
average particle number constant, and we introduce a chemical potential p of the
reservoir to accommodate this constraint. Essentially, the result obtained from the
canonical ensemble is carried over to the grand canonical ensemble by the substitution
H —> H —p N , where N is the particle number operator. The corresponding density
m atrix pG and partition function Z G are defined as:

pc = e * <»-«•*>,

Zo=Tr]pa],

(1.11#)

where the trace now includes states with any number of particles. Likewise, it is useful
to introduce the Hamiltonian H G corresponding to the grand canonical ensemble,
HG = H - pN .

(1.120)

Unfortunately, the symbol H is often used instead of Hc for the grand canonical
Hamiltonian, so the reader must always carefully check whether H refers to the canon­
ical or to the grand canonical ensemble. In this book, we shall for brevity write H in
both cases. This ought not cause any problems, since most of the times we are working
in the grand canonical ensemble, i.e., we include the term p N in the Hamiltonian.
The partition functions Z and Z c are more than mere normalization factors. Their
role as fundamental quantities in statistical mechanics is reflected by the following
observation: Z and ZG are directly related to the free energy F = U — T S in the
canonical ensemble and to the thermodynamic potential fi = U — T S — p N in the
grand canonical ensemble, respectively,
Z = e * p , with F = U - T S ,

(1.121a)

Zc = e * a , with S! = U —T S - p iV.

(1.121b)

Let us now study the free energy, which is minimal when the entropy is maximal.
Recall th at
F = U — T S = (H) —T S .
(1.122)
In various approximation schemes, for example the mean field approximation in Chap­
ter 4, we shall use the principle of minimizing the free energy. This is based on the
following inequality
F < { H ) 0 - T S 0,
(1.123)
7Remember that if t„= TV [A] is the trace o f A in the basis \
v),then in the transformed basis
U \v) we have tu v = Tt [t/A f/- 1 ] = Tr [A U ~l U] = Tr [A] — t„. Here we have used that the trace is
invariant under cyclic permutation, i.e., Tr [ABC] = TV [BCA\.

The distribution function fo r non-interacting fermions

As the tem perature is raised from zero in a system of non-interacting fermions, the
occupation number for the individual energy eigenstates begins to fluctuate rather
than being constantly 0 or constantly 1. Using th e grand canonical ensemble, we can
derive the famous Fermi-Dirac distribution n F(e).

1 electron. The average occupation nF(£k) is therefore

We shall study the properties of the Fermi-Dirac distribution in Section 2.1.3. Note
th at the Fermi Dirac distribution is defined in the grand canonical ensemble. The
proper Hamiltonian is therefore Hc = H - p N . This is reflected in the single-particle
energy variable. From Eq. (1.125) we see that the natural single-particle energy vari­
able is not ek but rather £k given by

For small excitation energies £k varies around p whereas £k varies around 0.

The distribution function fo r non-interacting bosons

Next we find the distribution function for non-interacting bosons. Again using the
grand canonical ensemble we derive the equally famous Bose-Einstein distribution
n B(e). It is derived like its fermionic counterpart, the Fermi-Dirac distribution n F(e).
Consider a bosonic state characterized by its fundamental energy £k . The oc­
cupation number of the state can be any non-negative integer n k = 0 ,1 ,2 ,.... In
the grand canonical ensemble the average occupation number n B(ek) is found by

In this chapter we have introduced second quantization, the representation of quan­
tum mechanics we are going to use throughout this book. The basic concepts are the
occupation number basis states and the fundamental creation and annihilation oper­
ators, bl and b„ in the bosonic case (see Eq. (1.41)), and c l and c„ in the fermionic
case (see Eq. (1.52)). The intricate perm utation symmetries are manifestly insured
by the basic (anti-)commutator relations of these fundamental operators,

In fact. perhaps after some measure of acquaintance, this main result appears so sim­
ple and intuitively clear that one could choose to define quantum theory directly in
second quantization rather than going the cumbersome way from first to second quan­
tization. However, students usually learn basic quantum theory in first quantization,
so for pedagogical reasons we have chosen to start from the usual first quantization
representation.
In Section 1.4 we presented a number of specific examples of second quantization
operators, and we got a first glimpse of how second quantization leads to a formulation
of quantum physics in terms of creation and annihilation of particles and field quanta.
Note in particular the trace-formular Eq. (1.118) for therm al averages of quantum
operators.

(1982), or Kittel and Kroemer (2000).

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

31

In the following three chapters we shall get more acquainted with second quanti­
zation through studies of simplified stationary problems for non-interacting systems
or systems where a given particle only interacts with the mean field of the other par­
ticles. First in Chapter 5 will the question be raised of how to treat time evolution
in second quantization. W ith an answer to th at question we can proceed with the
very interesting but also rather difficult studies of the full time dependent dynamics
of many-particle quantum systems.
Some useful textbooks on first quantization are Dirac (1989). Landau and Lifshitz
(1977), or Merzbacber (1970). Some classic textbooks on second quantization are
Mahan (1990), Fetter and Walecka (1971), and Abrikosov. Gorkov, and Dzyalushinskii
(1975). For good introductions to statistical physics th e reader can consult Landau
and Lifshitz (1982), Kittel and Kroemer (2000), and Feynman (1972).

THE ELECTRON GAS

The study of the interacting electron gas moving in a charge-compensating l>ackground of positively charged ions is central in this book. Not only is this system a
model of the solids that surround us, such as metals, semiconductors, and insulators,
but historically this system played a m ajor role as testing ground for the development
of quantum held theory. In this chapter we shall study the basic properties of this
system using the formalism of time-independent second quantization as developed
in Chap. 1. The main emphasis will be on the non-interacting electron gas, since it
will be clear th at we need to develop our theoretical tools further to deal with the
electron-electron interactions in full.
Any atom in a metal consists of three parts: the positively charged heavy nucleus
at the center, the light cloud of the many negatively charged core electrons tightly
bound to the nucleus, and finally, the outermost few valence electrons. The nucleus
with its core electrons is denoted an ion. The ion mass is denoted M , and if the atom
has Z valence electrons the charge of the ion is + Z e. To a large extent the inner
degrees of freedom of the ions do not play a significant role, leaving the center of
mass coordinates R, and total spin Sj of the ions as the only dynamical variables.
In contrast to the core electrons, the Z valence electrons, each with mass m and
charge - e , are often free to move away from their respective host atoms forming a
gas of electrons swirling around among the ions. This is true for the alkali metals.
The formation of a metal from N independent atoms is sketched in Fig. 2.1.

At zero tem perature the ground state of the system is a periodic Ion lattice held
together by the cohesive forces of the surrounding electron gas. In principle it is possi­
ble In ab initio calculations to minimize the energy of the system and find the crystal
structure and lattice parameters, i.e., the equilibrium positions R , of the ions in the
lattice. From the obtained ground state one can then study the various excitations of
the system: phonons (ion vibrations), electron-hole excitations (single-particle excita­
tions), plasiuons (collective electronic charge density waves), magnons (spin waves),
etc. In this book we will not plunge into such full fledged ab initio calculations. Two
approximation schemes will be used instead. One is the phenomenological lattice ap­
proach. We take the experimental determination of the crystal structure, lattice pa­
rameters and elasticity constants as input to the theory, and from there calculate the
electronic and pbononic properties. The other approximation scheme, the so-called
jetlium model, is in fact an ab initio calculation where, however, the discrete nature
of the ionic system is approximated by a positively charged, continuous and homoge­
neous fluid, the ion "jellium." Fortunately, most electronic and phononic properties
of the system can be derived with good accuracy from the Hamiltonian describing the
ion jellium combined with the electron gas.

T he non-interacting electron gas

We first study the lattice model and the jellium model in the case of no electronelectron interaction. Later in Section 2.2 we attem pt to include this interaction.

Bloch theory o j electrons in a static ion lattice

Let us first consider the phenomenological lattice model. X-ray experiments show
th at the equilibrium positions of the ions form a periodic lattice. This lattice has au
energy £jatt and an electrical potential V^nat associated with it, both originating from

THE ELECTRON GAS

a combination of Tkm, Vion-km, and Uei-ion in the original Hamiltonian Eq. (2.1). At
finite tem perature the ions can vibrate about their equilibrium positions with the
total electric field acting as the restoring force. As will be demonstrated in Chapter 3,
these vibrations can be described in terms of quantized harmonic oscillators (much
like the photon field of Section 1.4.2) giving rise to the concept of phonons. The non­
interacting part of the phonon field is described by a Hamiltonian H ph- Finally, the
electrons are described by their kinetic energy Tej, their m utual interaction
and their interaction with both the static part of the lattice,
and the vibrating
part, i.e., the phonons,
The latter term must be there, since a vibrating ion
is giving rise to a vibrating electrical potential influencing the electrons. Thus the
Hamiltonian for the phenomenological lattice model changes H of Eq. (2.1) into

H = (Eutt + ffph) + (Tc, + V*-*) + (Vk-ut + V„,_ph).

(2.5)

At zero tem perature the ions are not vibrating except for their quantum mechanical
zero point motion. Thus we can drop all the phonon-related terms of the Hamiltonian.
If one furthermore neglects the electron-electron interaction (in Section 2.2 we study
when this is reasonable) one arrives a t the Hamiltonian i/oioch use^ bi Bloch's theory
of non-interacting electrons moving in a static, periodic ion lattice:

*■+*«-(* {£^iSL"wSr£)

<*■«>

To solve the corresponding Schrodinger equation, and later the phonon problem, we
have to understand the Fourier transform of periodic functions.
Let the static ion lattice be described by the ionic equilibrium positions R in terms
of integer linear combinations of the lattice basis vectors { a ,.a 2 ,a 3}:
R = n (a i + n 2 a 2 + 11383 ,

n j ,n 2 .n 3 € Z.

(2.7)

When working with periodic lattices, it is often convenient to Fourier transform from
the direct space to k-space, also known as the reciprocal space. RS. It is useful to
introduce the reciprocal lattice, RL, in RS defined by
RL = | g G RS | e'G R = 1j => G = m 1b 1+ m2b 2 4-m3b 3.

m ,,m 2,m 3 € Z, (2.8)

An important concept is the first Brillouin zone, FBZ, defined as all k in RS lying
closer to G = 0 than to any other reciprocal lattice vector G / 0. Using vectors
k 6 FBZ, any wavevector q e RS can be decomposed (the figure shows the FBZ for
a 2D square lattice):

We see th at any given coefficient ck only couples to other coefficients of the form ck+G,
i.e., each Schrodinger equation of the form Eq. (2.13) for ck couples to an infinite,

equations has exactly one representative k G FBZ, while any k outside FBZ does not
give rise to a new set of equations. The infinite family of equations generated by a

Non-interacting electrons in the jellium model

In the effective mass approximation of the lattice model the electron eigenstates are
plane waves. Also the jellium model results in plane wave solutions, which arc therefore
of major interest to study.
In the jellium model the ion charges are imagined to be smeared out to form
a homogeneous and, to begin with, static positive charge density, + Z p jc|, the ion
jellium. The periodic potential,
present in a real lattice becomes the constant
potential Vrc|-jei as sketched in Fig. 2.3. If we concentrate on the homogeneous part
of the electron gas, i.e., discard the part of
th at leads to inhomogeneities, we
notice th at this part together with the ion jellium forms a completely charge neutral
system. In other words, in H of Eq. (2.1) we have Vrian_ ioo + V'i_„| + K |_ ton = 0 . and

In the last equation we again used Eq. (2.26). The result is reasonable, since the
system consists of N electrons each with an energy 0 < £k < eF. The kinetic energy

study the Coulomb interaction. By Eqs. (2.26) and (2.28) it can be expressed in terms

The next concept to be introduced for the non-interacting electron gas is the

interval A e around the energy e, A N = D( e)A e , and the density of states per volume

Non-interacting electrons at finite temperature

Finally, before turning to the problem of the Coulomb interaction, we study some basic
tem perature dependencies. As the tem perature is raised from zero, the occupation
number is given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution n F(£k), see Eq. (1.125). The main
characteristics of this function are shown in Fig. 2.5. Note th at, to be able to see
any effects of the tem perature in Fig. 2.5, kBT is set to 0.03 eF corresponding to
T fts 2400 K. At room tem perature kRT / ef w 0.003. thus the low' tem perature limit

to have a clearly ohservable deviation from the T = 0 K case, which is indicated
by the dashed lines.
At T = 0 the chemical potential p is identical to cF. But in fact p varies slightly
with tem perature. A careful analysis based on the so-called Sommerfcld expansion
combined with the fact th at the number of electrons does not change with tem perature
yields

Because eF according to Eq. (2.27) is around 80 000 K for metals, we find that, even
at the melting tem perature of metals, only a very limited number A N of electrons
are affected by thermal fluctuations. Indeed, only the states within 2kBT of eF are
actually affected, and more precisely we have A N /N = 6kBT /e F ( » 10-3 at room
tem perature). The Fermi sphere is not destroyed by heating, it is only slightly smeared.
Now we have at hand an explanation of the old paradox in thermodynamics, as to why
only the ionic vibrational degrees of freedom contribute significantly to the specific
heat of solids. The electronic degrees of freedom are am ply “frozen" in. Only at
tem peratures comparable to eF they begin to play a m ajor role. As we shall see in
Section 2.3.1 this picture is not true for semiconductors, where the electron density
is much smaller than in metals.

which in k-space (see Eqs. (1.102) and (1.103)) corresponds to a vanishing wavcvector q = 0, has already been taken into account in the jellium model to cancel the
homogeneous positive background. We thus exclude the q = 0 term in the following

ELECTRON INTERACTIONS IN PERTURBATION THEORY

However, as we shall see, the direct use of this interaction with the tools developed
so far liecomes the story of the rise and fall of simple-minded perturbation theory.
The first-order calculation works well and good physical conclusions can lx? drawn,
but already in second order the calculation collapses due to divergent integrals. It
turns out th at to get rid of these divergences the more powerful tools of quantum
field theory must be invoked. But let us see how we arrive at these conclusions.
A natural question arises: under which circumstances can the non-interacting elec­
tron gas actually serve as a starting point for a perturbation expansion in the inter­
action potential? The key to the answer lies in the density dependence of the kinetic
energy Eyia = & 0)/ N <x n i displayed in Eq. (2.29). This is to be compared to the

revealing the following, perhaps somew'hat counter-intuitive, fact: the importance of
the electron-electron interaction diminishes as the density of the electron gas increases.
Due to the Pauli exclusion principle the kinetic energy simply becomes the dominant
energy scale in the interacting electron gas at high densities. Consequently, we ap­
proach the problem from this limit in the following analysis.
We begin the perturbation treatm ent by establishing the relevant length scale
and energy scale for the problem of interacting charges. The prototypical example
is of course the hydrogen atom, where a single electron orbits a proton. The ground
state is a spherically symmetric s-wave with a radius denoted the Bohr radius do and
an energy E0. The following considerations may be helpful mnemotechnically. The
typical length scale a0 yields a typical momentum p = fi/a0. W riting E0 as the sum
of kinetic energy p2/2 m and potential energy - e § / a 0, we arrive a t E0 = 2ma~l ~ S*The values of Oq and E q are found either by minimization,

where q ^ 0 leads to ki 4- q ^ k i . which results in a simple anticomm utator yielding
the occupation number operators with a minus in front. Since only one k-vector
appears we now drop the index 1.
The k- and q-sum are converted into integrals, and polar coordinates (q, 6q, <pq) and
(M fc ,& ) are employed. First, note th a t the integral is independent of the direction
of q so th a t J *j d(cas0q)
doq = 47r. Second, only for 0 < q < 2kF does the theta
function product give a non-zero result. For a given fixed value of q the rest of the
integral is just the overlap volume between two spheres of radius kF displaced by q.
The geometry of this volume is sketched in Fig. 2.6, and is calculated by noting th at
q/2kF < cos6k < 1, and th a t for a given cos6k we have g/(2cosd&) < k < kF. The

This result shows th at the electron gas is stable when the repulsive Coulomb inter­
action is turned on; see Fig. 2.7. No external confinement potential is needed to hold
the electron gas in the ion jellium together. There exists an optim al density n", or
inter-particle distance r*. which minimizes the energy and furthermore yields an en­
ergy E* < 0. The negative exchange energy overcomes the positive kinetic energy.
The equilibrium situation is obtained from £ - ( E w + & l)) = 0. and we can compare
the result with experiment:

(2.44)
We note th at the negative binding energy is due to the exchange energy of the
Coulomb interaction. Physically this can be interpreted as an effect of the Pauli
exclusion principle: the electrons are forced to avoid each other, since only one electron
at a time can be at a given point in space. The direct “classical” Coulomb interaction

docs not take this into account and is therefore over-estimating the energy, and the
exchange part corrects for this by being negative.
One may wonder what happens to the Fermi sphere as the interaction is turned on.
We found before th at thermal smearing occurs b u t is rather insignificant compared to
the huge Fermi energy,
« 7 eV. However, now we have learned th at the interaction
energy per particle is as 1.3 eV, i.e., smaller th an but certainly comparable to £p.
One of the great results of quantum field theory, which we are going to study later in
the book, is the explanation of why the Fermi surface is not destroyed by the strong
Coulomb interaction between the electrons.
2.2.2

Electron interactions in second-order perturbation theory

One may try to improve on the first-order result by going to second-order perturbation
theory. However, the result is disastrous. The m atrix elements diverge w ithout giving
hope for a simple cure.
Here, wre can only reveal what goes wrong, and then later learn how to deal
correctly with the infinities occurring in the calculations. According to second-order
perturbation theory, E (2) is given by

where all the intermediate states \v) must be different from |FS). As sketched in
Fig. 2.8, this combined with the momentum-conserving Coulomb interaction, yields
intermediate states where two particles are injected out of the Fermi sphere. FYom
such an intermediate state, |FS) is restored by p utting the excited electrons back into
the holes they left behind. Only two types of processes are possible: the direct and
the exchange process.
We now proceed to show th at the direct interaction process gives a divergent
contribution

small momentum transfers q. For the direct process the constraint |i/)

The exchange process does not lead to a divergence, since in this case the momentum

V 2 is replaced by V'q V'itj_i,l _q oc q~2 for q -» 0, which is less singular than V* ot q~4.
This divergent behavior of second-order perturbation theory is a nasty surprise.
We know th at physically, the energy of the electron gas must be finite. The only
hope for rescue lies in regularization of the divergent behavior by taking higher order
perturbation terms into account. In fact, as we shall see in Chapter 14, it turns out
th at one has to consider perturbation theory to infinite order, which is possible using
the full machinery of quantum field theory to be developed in the coming chapters.

We end this chapter on the electron gas by mentioning a few experimental realizations
of electron gases in 3D, 2D and ID. To work in various dimensions is a good oppor­
tunity to test one’s understanding of the basic principles of the physics of electron
gases. But as will become clear, this is not ju st an academic exercise. Experiments on
electron gases a t reduced dimensionality is of increasing importance.

A generic band structure for an insulator or a semiconductor. The Fermi level ep
lies at the top of the valence band resulting in possible excitations energies of at
least £gap, the distance up to the unoccupied conduction band.

im portant param eter is the position of the Fermi energy eF relative to the bands as
sketched in Fig. 2.9. In the metallic case, eF lies in the middle of a band. Consequently,
there is no energy gap between the last occupied level and the first unoccupied level,
and any, however small, external field can excite the system and give rise to a signif­
icant response. In an insulator, eF is a t the top of a band, the so-called filled valence
band, and filled bands do not carry any electrical or therm al current.11 The system
can only be excited by providing sufficient energy for the electrons to overcome the
energy band gap Egttp between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the
next empty band, the so-called conduction band. This is not possible for small ex­
ternal fields, and hence the inability of insulators to conduct electronic therm al and
electrical currents. Semiconductors are insulators at T = 0, bu t their band gap £ gap
is relatively small, typically less than 2 eV, such th at a t room tem perature a suffi­
cient number of electrons are excited thermally up into the conduction band to yield
a significant conductivity.
We emphasize th at at room tem perature the electron gas in a metal is a degen­

Finally, we note th at in a typical metal most of the electron states at the Fermi
surface are far away from the regions in k-space where the free electron dispersion
relation is strongly distorted by the periodic lattice. Therefore, one finds effective
masses m*t see Eq. (2.16), close to the vacuum mass m. In contrast, all the electron

2.3.2 2D electron gases: GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructures
For the past four decades it has been possible to fabricate 2D electron gases at semi­
conductor interfaces. The first realization was inversion layers in the celebrated sil­
icon MOSFETs, the key component in integrated electronic circuits. More recent
realizations are in gallium-arsenide/gallium-aliuninum-arsenide (GaAs/Gai_j.Alz As)
heterostructures. In the latter system one can obtain extremely long mean free paths
(more than 10 pm), which is technologically important for high-speed electronics, and
which is essential for the basic research of many quantum effects in condensed m atter
physics.
The interface between the GaAs and the G ai_r A l,A s semiconductor crystals in
the G aA s/G ai_r Alr As heterostructure can be grown with mono-atomic-layer preci­
sion in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) machines. This is because the two semicon­
ductor crystals have nearly the same crystal structure leading to a stress-free interface.
In Fig. 2.10, a top-view of a typical device is shown as well as a sketch of the various
layers in a GaAs heterostructure. The main difference between the two semiconductor
crystals is the values of the bottom of the conduction band. For x — 0.3, the con­
duction Itand in Gaj_*Al*As is 300 meV higher than the one in GaAs. Hence the
electrons in the former conduction band can gain energy by moving to the latter. At
T = 0 there are, of course, no free carriers in any of the conduction hands for pure
semiconductor systems, but by doping the G ai_ r Alr As with Si, conduction electrons
are provided, which then accumulate on the GaAs side of the interface due to the energy gain. However, not all donor electrons will be transferred. The ionized Si donors
left in the G ai_ TAlxAs provide an electrostatic energy th at grows with an increas­
ing number of transferred electrons. At some point the energy gained by transferring
electrons to the GaAs layer is balanced by the growth in electrostatic energy. This is
sketched in Fig. 2.11 where the resulting conduction band in equilibrium is shown as
function of the position z perpendicular to the interface. The conduction band is not

flat due to the curvature induced by th e charge densities, as calculated from Poisson's
equation: V 2! ' = —en3D/e*.
The key point to notice is the formation of the almost triangular quantum well at
the GaAs side of the interface. T he well is so narrow th at a significant size-quantization
is obtained. W ithout performing the full calculation, we can get a grasp of the order
of magnitude by the following estimate. We consider the positively charged layer of
the ionized Si donors as one plate of a plate capacitor, while the conduction electrons
at the GaAs/GaAlAs interface form the other plate. The charge density outside this
capacitor Is zero. The electrical field E at the interface is then found simply by forming
a cylindrical Gauss box with its axis along the z direction and one circular “bottom
lid" a t the interface and the other “top lid” deep into the GaAs. All the contributions
stems from the “bottom lid," since for symmetry reasons E must be perpendicular
to the z axis, yielding zero from the side of the cylindrical box, and since for the
reason of cliarge neutrality, E = 0 at the “top lid." Thus at the interface E = en/c*,
n being the 2D electron density at the interface. The typical length scale / for the
width of the triangular well is found by balancing the potential energy and the kinetic
quantum energy. eE l — h2/(m * l2), which gives I3 = ^ m-'/m n*• where we have used
the Bohr radius a0 of Eq. (2.36) to bring in atomic units. The experimental input
for GaAs is «• = 13<0, m* = 0.067m. and typically n = 3 x 1015 m -2 , which yields
I 5 nm. From this we get the typical quantization energy A E due to the triangular
well: A E = (m /m ‘ )(a,,2// 2) 13.6 eV « 20 meV.
The significance of this quantization energy is the following. Due to the triangular
well the 3D free electron wavefunction is modified.

(sec Exercise 2.4 and compare to Eq. (2.26) for the 3D case). The highest occupied
state has the energy Eo + £p while the lowest unoccupied state has the energy £ j.
The difference is E i — (Eo + ep) = A E —eF as 10 meV as 100 K, and we arrive at our
conclusion: At tem peratures T C 100 K all occupied electron states have the same
orbital in the z direction, £0 (2 ). Any changes of this orbital requires an excitation
energy of a t least 10 meV. If this is not provided the system has effectively lost one
spatial degree of freedom and is dynamically a 2D system. This means that theoretical
studies of 2D electron gases is far from an academic exercise: 2D systems do indeed
exist in reality.
2.3.3

ID electron gases: carbon nanotubes

Since the mid-1990s a new research field has developed involving studies of the cylindrically shaped carbon-based molecule, the so-called carbon nanotube. The carbon
nanotube can be viewed as a normal graphite sheet rolled up into a cylinder with
a radius R q w 2 nm and a length more th an a thousand times Re, see Fig. 2.12.
These long a nd thin carbon molecules have some extraordinary material characteris­
tics. They are believed to be the strongest material in the world, and depending on
the specific way the cylinder is rolled up the nanotubes are either metallic, semicon­
ducting or insulating. In the same dynamical sense as the GaAs heterostructure is a
2D metal sheet, a metallic nanotube is a nearly ideal ID wire, i.e., two of the three
spatial degrees of freedom are frozen in. We briefly sketch how this comes about.
The cylindrical symmetry of the nanotube makes it natural to change the basis
functions from the 3D ( x ,y ,z ) plane waves to cylindrical (x,r, <fr) wavefunctions:

* .( » ) =

X. ->

RnlM W ) x „ . (2.52)

This is of course more than ju st a mathematical transformation. The electrons are
strongly bound to the surface of the cylinder in quantum states arising from the orig­
inal x-bonds of the graphite system. This means th at the extension A R of the radial
wave function Rnl{r) around the mean value Re is of atomic scale, i.e.. A R « 0.1 nm,
resulting in a radial confinement energy E £ ~ A2/(2mAW2) ~ 10 eV. Likewise, in the
azimuthal angle coordinate <j>, there is a strong confinement, since the perimeter must
contain an integer number of electron wavelengths A„, i.e., An = 2ttR o/n < 2 nm.
The corresponding confinement energy is E * ~ A2/(2mA2 ) ~ 1 eV n. There arc no
severe constraints along the cylinder axis, i.e., in the x direction. We therefore end
up with a total energy
C u .^ = E ? + E * + ^ k l ,

(2.53)

with a considerable gap A E from the center of the (n ,l ) = (0,0) band (the position
of Ep for the metallic case) to the bottom of the (n, I) = (0,1) band:
A E = i ( E t - E$) *= 1 eV ~ 12 000 K.

Not only are nanotubes very interesting from an experimental point of view, they
also play an important role in purely theoretical studies. The nanotubes is one of only
a couple of systems exhibiting a nearly ideal ID behavior. In particular th at makes the
nanotubcs a key testing ground for the diagonizable so-called Luttinger liquid model,
a central quantum model for describing interacting electrons in ID, see Chapter 19.
2.3.4

0D electron gases: quantum dots

Naturally, one can think of confining the electrons in all three spatial dimensions. Any
isolated atom or molecule is an example of such a case. But also so-called artificial
atom s or quantum dots have been realized experimentally. One example of this is the
semiconductor device shown in Fig. 2.10(b), and likewise small metal clusters have
been studied. By careful preparation electrodes can be attached near the quantum
dot, so that small electrical probe currents can be sent through the quantum dot
without disturbing it too much.
Lately, it has been demonstrated th at also large molecules like Coo or carbon
nanotubes can be placed in the gap between two electrodes, and thus play the role as
quantum dots.
Simplified models of quantum dots are studied in Chapter 10. But here we would
like to emphasize that the quantum dots usually do not have any nice spatial symme­
tries. Hence, the single-particle eigenstates must be characterized by a general index
v for the spatial degrees of freedom and a for the spin. The single particle energy
spectrum euo is discrete with some typical non-zero level spacing Ae.
Using the general theory of second quantized operators presented in Sections 1.3
and 1.4 we arrive a t the following Hamiltonian H D for an isolated quantum dot with
(possibly magnetic) electron-electron interaction:

This Hamiltonian is the starting point for the study of many aspects of OD systems.
Especially, as we shall see when we return to it in Chapter 10, it is a central element in
the theory of electron transport in systems containing quantum dots. T he Hamiltonian
H d gives rise to a number of intricate quantum transport effects, such as the Coulomb
blockade and the Hondo effect, once it is coupled to 3D electron reservoirs by some
tunneling Hamiltonian describing the transfer of electrons between the quantum dot
and the reservoirs. However, to be able to handle such complex problems we need to
develop our theoretical tools further.

Sum m ary and outlook

In this chapter we have introduced one of the main examples in this book, the electron
gas in metals. In the rest of the book we shall study many different aspects of the
electron gas.

so-called Fermi sea or Fermi sphere |FS). This many-body state is defined as

where r , is the dimensionless average distance between the electrons. However, a
fundamental problem was revealed when going to second order in the perturbation.
The supposedly small second-order correction to the energy diverged. The solution of
this problem is one of the main achievements of many-body theory, and it is treated
in Chapter 14.
Some good introductory textbooks on electron gases and metals are Kittel (1995)
or Ashcroft and Mermin (1981).

3
PHONONS; COUPLING TO ELECTRONS
In this chapter we study the basic properties of ionic vibrations. These vibrations are
well described by harmonic oscillators and, therefore, we can employ the results from
Section 1.4.1 to achieve the second-quantized form of the corresponding Hamiltonian.
The quantized vibrations are denoted phonons, a name pointing to the connection
between sound waves and lattice vibrations. Phonons play a fundamental role in our
understanding of sound, specific heat, elasticity, and electrical resistivity of solids.
More surprising may be the fact th at the electron-phonon coupling is the cause of
conventional superconductivity. In the following sections we shall study the three types
of m atter oscillation sketched in Fig. 3.1. The ions will be treated using two models:
the jellium model, where the ions are represented by a smeared-out continuous positive
background, and the lattice model, where the ions oscillate around their equilibrium
positions forming a regular crystal lattice.
Since phonons basically are harmonic oscillators, they are bosons according to
the results of Section 1.4.1. Moreover, they naturally occur at finite temperature,
so we will, therefore, often need the therm al distribution function for bosons, the
Bose-Einstein distribution n B(e) given in Eq. (1.127).

q
These quantized ion oscillations are denoted phonons, and a model like this was
proposed by Einstein in 1906 as the first attem pt to explain the decrease of heat
capacity
of solids as a function of decreasing tem perature (see Section 3.5). Note
th at the origin of the ionic plasma frequency is the long-range Coulomb interaction,
which entered the analysis through the Maxwell equation V • E = Ze6pton/ t 0.
However, the Einstein phonons (also denoted optical phonons, see Section 3.3)
are not a very good description of solids. Although it is correct th at C{?° decreases a t
low tem perature, the exact behavior is described by the Debye model, incorporating
phonons with a photon-like dispersion
= vB q. where vt is the sound velocity,
instead of the Einstein dispersion u;q = 12. These Debye phonons are also denoted
acoustical phonons due to their relation to sound propagation. This is explained in
details in Sections 3.3 and 3.5. To fully understand how the optical Einstein phonons
get renormalized to become the acoustical Debye phonons requires the full machinery
of quantum field theory, but we hint a t the solution of the problem in Fig. 3.1(b) and

Compared to the light and very mobile valence electrons, the ions are much heavier,
by a factor of more than 104, and much slower. Consequently, one would expect the

electrons to follow the motion of the ions adiabatically and thereby always maintaining
local charge neutrality and thus lowering th e high ionic plasma frequency 0 , which is
due to long-range charge Coulomb forces from the charge imbalance. This situation is
depicted in Fig. 3.1(b), and to illustrate its correctness we now use it to estimate the
sound velocity in metals. The kinetic energy density associated with a sound wave is of
the order \ M vb pjon, while the potential energy density associated w ith the restoring
force must be related to the density dependent energy content of the compressed
electron gas, i.e., of the order §pe|£F. In a stationary state these two energy densities
must be of the same order of magnitude. This gives an estimate for vB, which in a
more detailed treatm ent (see Exercise 3.4) is expressed by the Bohm-Staver formula,
(3.5)
which for typical numbers yields vB ~ 3000 m /s as found experimentally. Note, how
this estimate builds on classical considerations of the ionic motion while using the
quantum result for the energy content of a degenerate electron gas. Surprisingly, an
ordinary macroscopic phenomenon such as sound propagation is deeply rooted in
quantum physics.

Even though we are not yet able to demonstrate how to turn the optical ion plasma
oscillations into acoustical phonons, we can, nevertheless, learn a lot by simply pos­
tulating the existence of a periodic ion lattice (as observed in nature), in which the
ions can execute small oscillatory motion around their equilibrium positions. The
surroundings somehow provide the restoring force.
We begin by a simple ID quantum mechanical model consisting of a ID box of
length L containing N ions of mass M each interacting with its two neighbors through
a linear force field (a spring) with the force constant K . The equilibrium position of
the j t h ion is denoted R°, while its displacement away from this position is denoted
Uj. The lattice spacing is denoted a — R!j —
so we have L = N a . This setup
is shown in Fig. 3.2. The Hamiltonian is simply the sum of the kinetic energy of the
ions and the potential energy of the springs, while the ion momentum pj and the
displacement Uj are canonical variables:

As for the photon and jellium models, we impose periodic boundary conditions,
u N+l — Uj. Since the equilibrium system is periodic with the lattice spacing a, it
is natural to solve the problem in fc-space by performing a discrete Fourier transform.
In analogy with electrons moving in a periodic lattice, also the present system of N
ions forming a periodic lattice leads to a first Brillouin zone, FBZ, in reciprocal space.
By Fourier transformation the N ion coordinates become N wave vectors in the FBZ:

This looks almost like the Hamiltonian feu- a set of harmonic oscillators except for
some annoying details concerning k and —k. Note th at while p} in real space is a nice
Hermitian operator, pk in Jt-space is not self-adjoint. In fact, the hermiticity of p} and
the definition of the Fourier transform lead to

in Eq. (3.9) tells us th at uk and p _ k form a pair of conjugate variables, we will not
use this pair to form creation and annihilation operators in analogy with x and p of
Eq. (1.75). The reason is th at the Hamiltonian in the present case contains products
like PkP-k and not pf. as in the original case. Instead we combine uk and pk in the
definition of the annihilation and creation operators bk and b^k :

bt = T i { h + in k ) '

This is finally the canonical form of a Hamiltonian describing a set of independent
harmonic oscillators in second quantization. The quantized oscillations are denoted
phonons. Their dispersion relation is shown in Fig. 3.3(a). It is seen from Eq. (3.9)
th at in the limit k —►0 we have Uk = y /K /M a k , so our solution Eq. (3.11) does in fact
bring about the acoustical phonons. The sound velocity is found to be v, = y /K /M a,
so upon measuring the value of it, one can determine the value of the free paran>cter
K , the force constant in the model.
If, as shown in Fig. 3.3(b), the unit cell is doubled to hold two ions, the concept of
phonon branches must be introduced. It is analogous to the Bloch bands for electrons.
These came about as a consequence of breaking the translational invariance of the
system by introducing a periodic lattice. Now we break the discrete translational
invariance given by the lattice constant a. Instead the new lattice constant is 2a.
Hence the original BZ is halved in size and the original dispersion curve Fig. 3.3(a)
is broken into sections. In the reduced zone scheme in Fig. 3.3(b) we of course find
two branches, since no states can be lost. The lower branch resembles the original
dispersion so it corresponds to acoustic phonons. The upper band never approaches
zero energy, so to excite these phonons high energies are required. In fact they can
be excited by light, so they are known as optical phonons. The origin of the energy
difference between an acoustical and an optical phonon at the same wave length is
sketched in Fig. 3.4 for the case of a two-ion unit cell. For acoustical phonons the size
of the displacement of neighboring ions differs only slightly and its sign is the same,
whereas for optical phonons the sign of the displacement alternates between the two
types of ions.

The generalization to p ions per unit cell is straightforward, and one finds the
appearance of 1 acoustic branch and (p — 1) optical branches. The N appearing
above, e.g. in Eq. (3.8), should be interpreted as the number of unit cells rather than
the number of ions, so we have JVion = p N . A branch index A, analogous to the band
index n for Bloch electrons is introduced to label the different branches, and in the
general case the Hamiltonian Eq. (3.11) is changed into

The fundamental principles for constructing the second quantized phonon fields estab­
lished for the ID case carries over to the 3D case, almost unchanged. The most notable
difference is the appearance in 3D of polarization, in analogy to what we have already
seen for the photon field. We treat the general case of any monatomic Bravais lattice.
The ionic equilibrium positions are denoted R ° and the displacements by u (R ° ) with
components tiQ(R °), a = x , y, z. The starting point of the analysis is a second order

Note th at nothing has been assumed about the range of the potential. It may very well
go much beyond the nearest neighbor case studied in the ID case. The central object
in the theory is the force strength m atrix

Now, what about acoustical and optical phonons in 3D? It is clear from Eq. (3.17)
that D (k ) oc k 2 for it -» 0, so the same holds true for its eigenvalues K kX. The
dispersion relation in Eq. (3.19) therefore becomes
= v*(0*, <i>k) k, which describes
an acoustical phonon with a sound velocity uA(0*., f a ) in general depending on both
the direction of k and the polarization A. As in ID the number of ions in the unit
cell can l>e augmented from 1 to p. In th at case it can be shown th at of the resulting
3p modes 3 are acoustical and 3(p — 1) are optical modes. The acoustical modes are
appearing because it is always possible to construct modes where all the ions have
been given nearly the same displacement resulting in an arbitrarily low energy cost
associated with such a deformation of the lattice. The phonon modes for a unit cell
with three ions are shown in Fig. 3.5.
A 3D lattice with JV unit cells each containing p ions, each of which can oscillate
in 3 directions, is described by 3p N modes. In terms of phonon modes we end up
with 3p so-called phonon branches
which for each branch index A are defined at
N discrete points in k-space. Thus, in 3D the index A contains information on both
which polarization and which of the acoustical or optical modes we are dealing with.

Debye’s phonon model is a simple model, which describes the tem perature dependence
of the heat capacitance C y =
of solids exceedingly well, alt hough it contains just
one material dependent free parameter. The phonon spectrum Fig. 3.5(b) in the re­
duced zone scheme has 3p branches. The acoustical and optical phonon branches in
the extended zone scheme for a ID chain with two ions per unit cell are shown in
Fig. 3.6(a). Note, how the optical branch appears as an extension of the acousti­
cal branch. In d dimensions a reasonable average of the spectrum can be obtained

PHONONS; COUPLING TO ELECTRONS

by representing all the phonon branches in the reduced zone scheme with d acous­
tical branches in the extended zone scheme, each with a linear dispersion relation
= vyk. Furthermore, since we will use the model to calculate the specific heat
by averaging over all modes, we can even employ a suitable average uD over the po­
larization dependent velocities
and use the same linear dispersion relation for all
acoustical branches,
ct»kA =
=> £ = kvD k.
(3.24)
Even though we have deformed the phonon spectrum we may not change the number
of phonon modes. In the 3D Debye model we have 3iVion modes, in the form of 3
acoustic branches each with JVion allowed wavevectors, where N ioD is the number of
ions in the lattice. Since we are using periodic boundary conditions the counting of
the allowed phonon wavevectors is equivalent to th at of Section 2.1.2 for plane wave
electron states, i.e., N ioa = [V/(27r)3)x [volume in k-space]. Since the Debye spectrum
Eq. (3.24) is isotropic in k-space, the Debye phonon modes must occupy a sphere in
this space, i.e., all modes with |k| < fcD, where kD is denoted th e Debye wave number
determined by

Inserting kg into Eq. (3.24) yields the characteristic Debye energy, hwD and hence
the characteristic Debye tem perature TD:

Continuing the analogy with the electron case the density of phonon states D ph(e) is
found by combining Eqs. (3.24) and (3.25) and multiplying by 3 for the number of

We end this section by a historical remark. The very first published application
of quantum theory to a condensed m atter problem was in fact Einstein’s work from
1906, reproduced in Fig. 3.7(a), explaining the main features of Weber’s 1875 mea­
surements on diamond. In analogy with Planck’s quantization of the oscillators related
to blade body radiation, Einstein quantized the oscillators corresponding to the lat­
tice vibrations, assuming that all oscillators had the same frequency u E. So instead
of Eq. (3.27), Einstein employed the much simpler D ^0(e) = 6(e - huE), which
immediately leads to

While this theory also gives the classical result 3Ariont B in the high tem perature limit,
it exaggerates the decrease of C y ° a t low tem peratures by predicting an exponential
suppression. In Fig. 3.7(b) is shown a comparison of Debye's and Einstein's models.
Nowadays, Einstein's formula is still in use, since it provides a fairly accurate descrip­
tion of the optical phonons which in many cases have a reasonably fiat dispersion
relation.

The interpretation of this formula is quite simple. Under momentum conservation
(but only up to an undetermined reciprocal lattice vector due to the periodicity of
the lattice) and spin conservation, the electrons can be scattered from any initial state
|k, a}el to the final state |k 4- q -I- G , a )el either by absorbing a phonon from the state
|qA)ph or by emitting a phonon into the state | —qA)ph. A graphical representation
of this fundamental process is shown in Fig. 3.9.
The normal processes, i.e., processes where by definition G = 0, often tend to
dominate over the so-called umklapp processes, where G ^ 0, so in the following we
shall completely neglect the latter.13 Moreover, we shall treat only isotropic media,
13There are mainly two reasons why the umklapp processes often can be neglected: (1) K ,+ g

The electron-phonon coupling is a very im portant mechanism in condensed m atter
systems. It is the cause of a large part of electrical resistivity in metals and semicon­
ductors, and it also plays a major role in studies of heat transport. Exercise 3.1 and
Exercise 3.2 give a first idea of how the electron-phonon coupling leads to a scattering
or relaxation tim e for electrons.
We shall return to the electron-phonon coupling in Chapter 17, and there study the
remarkable instability of the electron gas induced by the intricate interplay between
electrons and phonons. This instability is the starting point of the very successful
microscopic theory of superconductivity, the so-called BCS theory. This theory will
be treated in Chapter 18, and we shall see how indeed the electron-phonon scattering
is the origin of conventional superconductivity.
For more details on the electron-phonon interaction see Mahan (1990).

The physics of interacting particles is often very complicated because the motions of
the individual particles depend on the position of all the others, or in other words
the particles motions become con-elated. This is clearly the case for a system of
charged particles interacting by Coulomb forces, such as e.g., the electron gas. There
we expect the probability to find two electrons in close proximity to be small due to
the strong repulsive interaction. Consequently, due to these correlation effects there
is a suppressed density in the neighborhood of every electron, and one talks about a.
“correlation hole"
Nevertheless, in spite of this complicated problem there are a number of cases
where a more crude treatm ent, not fully including the correlations, gives a good
physical model. In these cases it suffices to include correlations “on the average,”
which means th at the effect of the other particles is included as a mean density (or
mean-field), leaving an effective single-particle problem, which is soluble. This idea is
illustrated in Fig. 4.1. The mean-fields are chosen as those which minimize the free
energy, which in turn ensure th a t the method is consistent, as we shall see shortly.
This approximation scheme is called “mean-field theory.” Upon performing the meanfield approximation we can neglect the detailed dynamics and the time-independent
second-quantization method described in Chapter 1 suffices.

4.1

Basic concepts of mean-field theory

There exist numerous examples of the success of the mean-field method and its ability
to explain various physical phenomena. In this chapter, we shall discuss a few examples
from condensed m atter physics, but before going to specific examples let us discuss
the mathematical structure of the mean-field theory.
First we consider a system with two kinds of particles, described by operators a„
and b,,, respectively. Let us assume that only interactions between different kind of
particles are important. The Hamiltonian is
h

(4.1c)

Now suppose that we expect, based on physical arguments, th at the density oper­
ators aj,a„, and 6*6^, deviate only little from their average values, {o\,aui) and (6)^6^/).

F ig . 4.1. Illustration of the mean-field idea, (a) In a real physical system interactions
lead to correlated motion of the particles (black points), (b) In mean-field theory
any individual particle (blade point) interacts only w ith the average field (gray
background) of the other particles (open drcles).
It is then natural to use this deviation as a small param eter and perform an expansion.
In order to do so we define the deviation operators

(4.4)
Because d„„< and
are assmned to be small the second term in Eq. (4.3) is
neglected, and the interaction \ i s approximated by the mean-field interaction Vmf
resulting in the so-called mean-field Hamiltonian H\gp given by
Hmf = H0+ Vmf-

(4.5)

The mean-field Hamiltonian H\gg contains only single-particle operators, and thus
the original many-body problem has been reduced to a single-particle problem, which
in principle is always soluble (see Exercise 1.3).
Looking a t Eq. (4.4) we can formulate th e mean-field procedure in a different way:
For an interaction term being the product of two operators A and B,
H aB = A B ,

(4.6)

the mean-field approximation is given by A coupled to the mean-field of B plus B
coupled to the mean-field of A,

MEAN-FIELD THEORY

= -4(B) + {A )B - (4)<B).

(4.7)

Here, the product of the mean-fields is subtracted on the right hand Bide to ensure
the correct average: (H]jj£) = (A){B ).
The question is, however, how to find th e averages (a\,av,) and (b^b^,). There
arc two possible routes which in fact are equivalent. M ethod 1: The average is to be
determined self-consistently, i.e., when calculating the averages

using the new mean-field Hamiltonian, the same answer should come out. This means
for

"MF 1

(4.9)

where ZMF is the mean-field partition function given by
^ MK = ’iv[e-e

(4.10)

Eq. (4.9) and the similar one for n 6 are called the self-consistency equations, because
and fib are given by H mf and Z m f , which themselves depend on fia and flb.
Next we turn to the alternative route. M ethod 2: Use the n uu> th at minimizes
the free energy F \ if of the mean-field Hamiltonian. Using the expression for the free
energy given in Sec. 1.5, we obtain

° = ^ Fm= dk,{irinZM')

(4.11)
W»'
This should hold for any pair (u, i /) and hence the last parenthesis has to vanish and
we arrive at the self-consistency equation for n b. Similarly, by minimizing with respect
to fl6 we again obtain Eq. (4.9). Thus the two methods are equivalent.
We can gain some more understanding of the physical content of the mean-field
approximation if we look at average interaction energy (Vjnt). A natural approximat ion
would be to evaluate the expectation values of a and b operators separately,

(Vm) “ E

(4.12)

THE ART OF MEAN-FIELD THEORY

which is equivalent to assuming th a t the a and b particles are uncorrelated.u This
is in essence the approximation done in the mean-field approach. To see this let us
evaluate (Vim) using the mean-field Hamiltonian

T r[^

(4.13)

Because the mean-field Hamiltonian can be separated into a part containing only a
operators and a part containing only b operators. H u r = tfftp + #fcp» the average
factorizes exactly as in Eq. (4.12), and we get
=

(4.14)

The mean-field approach hence provides a consistent and physically sensible method
to study interacting systems where correlations are less important . Here “less impor­
tant" should be quantified by checking the validity of the mean-field approximation.
T hat is, one should check th at d indeed is small by calculating (d), using the neglected
term in Eq. (4.3) as a perturbation, and then compare the result to {a\,au>). If it is not
small, one has either chosen the wrong mean-field param eter, or the method simply
fails and other tools more adequate to deal with the problem a t hand must be applied.
4.2

T h e a r t o f m ean-field th e o ry

In practice, one has to assume something about the averages (a£o„,) and (bfab^,)
because even though Eq. (4.9) gives a recipe on how to find which averages are
important, there are simply too many possible combinations. Suppose we have JV
different quantum numbers, then there are in principle JV2 different combinations,
which gives JV2 coupled nonlinear equations, which of course is only tractable for
small systems. W ith modern computers one can treat hundreds of particles in this
way, but for a condensed m atter system, it is out of the question. Therefore, one must
provide some physical insight to reduce the number of mean-field parameters.
Often symmetry arguments can help in reducing the number of parameters. Sup­
pose for example th at the Hamiltonian th at we are interested in has translational
symmetry, such th at momentum space is a natural choice. For a system of particles
described by operators c and c*, we then have
<4<V> - y / *

/ A 7 .- 'l ' ' V k '< * t( r ) * ( 0 ) .

(4.15)

It is natural to assume th a t the system is homogeneous, which means
( * , ( r ) * ( r ') ) = / ( r - r ' )

=>

< 4 % '} = (» k )4 ,k '.

(4.16)

This assumption about homogeneity is, however, not always true, because in some
cases the symmetry of the system is lower th an th at of the Hamiltonian. For example,14
14Rcmomber from usual statistics that the correlation function between two stochastic quantities
X and Y Is defined by (X Y ) - (X )(Y ).

70

MEAN-FIELD THEORY

if the system spontaneously orders into a state with a spatial density variation, like
a wave formation then the average { $ f(r)^ (r')) is not function of the r — r ' only.
Instead it has a lower and more restricted symmetry, namely th at
{tft (r)'&(r')) = h (r, r ') ,

h( r , r ') = h (r + R , r ' + R ),

(4.17)

with R being a lattice vector. The kind of crystal structure of course exists in N ature
and when it happens, we talk about phenomena with broken symmetry. It is important
to realize th at this solution cannot be found if we assumed Eq. (4.16) as the starting
point. Instead, we should have begun by assuming Eq. (4.17) leading to the possibility
of (cjcCj{+q ) being finite, where R ■Q = 2 k . Thus, the choice of the proper mean-field
param eters requires physical motivation about which possible states one expects.
4.3

H a r tr e e -F o c k a p p ro x im a tio n

Above, we discussed the mean-field theory for interactions between different particles.
Here, we go on to formulate the method for like particles. For the interaction term
in Eq. (4.1a) we used the approximation to replace d la v, and b^, by their average
values plus small corrections. For interactions between identical particles this, how­
ever, does not exhaust the possibilities, since it only includes the so-called Hartree
term. We now move on to discuss the more general approximation scheme, called the
Hartree-Fock approximation.
Suppose we have a system of interacting particles described by the Hamiltonian
H = H0 + ViDt,

(4.18a)

#0 = ^ 4 4 ^

(4.18b)

Vint = ^

5^ V ^ ftb lc p C y ,.

(4.18c)

In Eq. (4.14) we saw th at the mean-field assumption amounted to separating the
expectation values with respect to the a and b particles. In other words, the parti­
cles were treated as being independent. Performing the same approximation for the
interaction term in Eq. (4.18c), we use a theorem called Wick’s theorem, which is
proved in Section 11.6. It states th at if the particles can be treated as being inde­
pendent (which is precisely the mean-field assumption) then the four-term average
(c j^ c ^ c ,,,) factorizes into two-term averages,
( 4 4 ‘v c- ' W = ( 4 v ) m f (c1 v >mp ± < 4 < y W ( 4 c“' ) w
where the minus sign is for fermions while the plus sign is for bosons. Wick’s theo­
rem thus says th at one should make all possible pairings while keeping track of sign
changes if two fermions are interchanged.15 The second term is new when compared
to Eq. (4.14). It is denoted the exchange term. Note th at when u — (i ov v' — y!
’Another way to derive Eq. (4.19) is to assume that the wavefunction is a product wavefunction.

HARTREE-FOCK APPROXIMATION

71

the product c£ct
is identically zero for fermions, which is consistent with the
Pauli exclusion principle, because fermions are never in same state. This principle is
fulfilled in the mean-field approximation in Eq. (4.19).
In order to find the self-consistency conditions, we must perform the approximation
of independent particles on the Hamiltonian as well. This is done in the same spirit
as we did for the case with interactions between different particles, except we must
include the exchange terms as well and, of course, remember to subtract the average
to avoid double counting. We thus arrive a t the mean-field approximation for identical
particles

(4.20)

It is easy to verify th at the average of Eq. (4.20) is Eq. (4.19). The two first terms in
Eqs. (4.19) and (4.20) represent the direct interaction, because they give the classical
expectation value of the interaction between two densities. For example in the case
of Coulomb interactions in Eq. (1.100a), we see th at the first term in Eq. (4.19)
corresponds to f d rl dr2V (r l —r 2)(p(r1))(/j(r2)). The exchange terms in Eqs. (4.19)
and (4.20) represent a quantum correction to this. For example, we saw in Section 2.2
th at the exchange energy explained the binding energy of metals.
The terms corresponding to the direct interactions constitute the Hartree approx­
imation. Applying this to the interaction term in Eq. (4.18c), we obtain

Hartree-Fock approximation fo r the homogeneous electron gas

Consider now the example of a homogeneous electron gas which is translation invari­
ant, which means th at the expectation value (ckck,) is diagonal. We can now read
off the corresponding Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian (see Exercise 4.1) from Eq. (1.103).

The second term is the interaction with the average electron charge. As explained in
Chapter 2, in condensed m atter systems it is normally cancelled out by an equally
large term due to the positively charged ionic background. The third term is the
exchange correction.
Again we emphasize th at the Hartree-Fock approximation depends crucially on
what averages we assume to be finite, and these assumptions must be based on physical
knowledge or clever guesswork. In deriving Eq. (4.24b) we assumed, e.g., th at the spin
symmetry is also maintained, which implies th at (cj^cm) = (c],Tck^). If we allow them
to be different we have the possibility of obtaining a ferromagnetic solution, which
indeed happens in some cases. This is discussed in Sec. 4.5.2.

4.4

Broken sym m etry

Mean-field theory is often used to study phase transitions and thus changes of sym­
metry. For a given Hamiltonian with some symmetry (e.g., translational symmetry in
real space or rotational symmetry in real space or in spin space) there exists an opera­
tor which reflects this symmetry and therefore commutes with the Hamiltoninn (e.g.,
the translation operator or the rotation operator in real space or spin space). Since
the operator and the Hamiltonian commute, we know from the theory of Hermitian
operators th at a common set of eigenstates exists. Consider, for example, th e case
of a liquid of particles where the Hamiltonian of course has translation symmetry,
which means that the translation operator T(R ) commutes with the Hamiltonian,
[H, T(R)) = 0 for all R. Here, T(R ) is an operator which displaces all particle co­
ordinates by the amount R. It can be written as T(R ) = exp ( — j-R P ). where P
is the total momentum operator. The total momentum operator is thus a conserved
quantity and it is given by

F ig . 4.2. The energetics of a phase transition in term s of the free energy F as a
function of the order param eter O characterizing the phase, (a) Above the critical
point the free energy has a well-defined minimum at the symmetry point, and
the system is in a state of large symmetry, (b) Below the critical point a two-well
potential develops and the system minimizes F by choosing one of the two possible
values of O. Even though the total potential is still symmetric the system will
reside only in one well due to the macroscopically large energy barrier and thus
the state of the system has “lower symmetry” th an the potential.
because cjcc1{+q |P ) has momentum P - Q and is thus orthogonal to |P ). We have
therefore reached the senseless result that crystals do not exist. In the same way,
we could “prove" th at magnetism, superconductivity, and other well-known physical
phenomena cannot happen. W hat is wrong?
The proof above breaks down if the sum of states in the thermodynamical average
is restricted. Even though crystals with different spatial reference points (or ferromagnets with magnetization in different directions) have formally the same energy,
they are effectively decoupled due to the large energy barrier it takes to melt and
then recrystallize into a new state w ith a shifted reference (or direction of magnetiza­
tion). In those cases where many states of the system are degenerate, but separated
by large energy barriers, it does not make sense to include them on equal footing in
the statistical average as in Eq. (4.27) because they correspond to macroscopically
totally different configurations. We are therefore forced to refrain from the fundamen­
tal ergodicity postulate of statistical mechanics, also discussed in Sec. 1.5, and build
into the description that the phase space of the system falls into physically separated
sections. This is often illustrated by the double barrier model of phase transitions
shown in Fig. 4.2.
When at some critical tem perature the thermodynamical state of the system de­
velops a non-zero expectation value of some macroscopic quantity which has a symme­
try lower than the original Hamiltonian it is called spontaneous breaking o f symmetry.
The quantity w'hich signals th at a phase transition has occurred is called the order
parameter. Typical examples are listed in Table 4.1.
In order to arrive a t the new phase in a calculation and to avoid the paradox
in Eq. (4.27), one has to build in the possibility of the new' phase into the theory'.
In the mean-field approach the trick is to include the order parameter in the choice
of finite mean-fields and, of course, show th at the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian
leads to a self-consistent finite result. Next we study examples of symmetry breaking

The Heisenberg model o f ionic ferromagnets

In ionic magnetic crystals the interaction between the magnetic ions is due to the
exchange interactions originating from the Coulomb interactions. Here we will not go
into the details of this interaction bu t simply give the effective Hamiltonian,10 known
as the Heisenberg model for interaction between spins in a crystal. It reads
* = - E

J « s < s i-

(4.28)

*3

where S, is the spin operator for the ion on site i and J y is the strength of the
interaction, between the magnetic moment of the ions on sites i and j . It depends
only on the distance between the ions. The interaction is generally short ranged and
we truncate it so th at it, as in Fig. 4.3, is only non-zero for nearest neightiors
.

f J 0, if i and j are neighbors.
J*i = \ 0, otherwise.

(429)

We immediately see th at if J < 0, the spins tend to become antiparallel whereas
for J > 0, it is energetically favorable to for the spins to be parallel. The first case
corresponds to the antiferromagnetic case, while the latter to the ferromagnetic case.
Here we consider only the ferromagnetic case, J > 0.
As the model Hamiltonian stands, although simple looking, it is immensely compli­
cated and cannot be solved in general, the spins of the individual ions being strongly
correlated. However, it is a good example where a mean-field solution gives an easy
and also physically correct answer. The mean-field decomposition then gives
,flTho term “effective Hamiltonian” has a well-defined meaning. It means the Hamiltonian describ­
ing tho Important degrees of freedom on the relevant low-energy scale.

Here (S<) is the average spin at site i. From symmetry arguments, we would expect
th at the expectation value of this is zero, because all directions are equivalent. But
since this is not the right answer, we must assume th at the symmetry is broken, i.e.,
allow for (Sj) to be non-zero. Furthermore, because of the translation symmetry we
expect it to be independent of position coordinate i.17 So we assume a finite but
spatially independent average spin polarization.
If we choose the z axis along the direction of the magnetization our mean-field
assumption is
(S ,) = < & )« .,

4.5.2

The Stoner model o f metallic ferromagnets

In magnets where the electrons both generate the magnetic moments and also form
conduction lmnds, the Heisenberg model cannot explain the magnetism. This is sim­
ply because the spins are not localized. Metallic magnetism happens, e.g., in transi­
tion metals where the conduction bands are formed by the narrower d ox f orbitals.
The interaction between two particles in those orbitals is stronger than that between
electrons occupying the more spread-out s or p orbitals, and hence give a larger corre­
lation l>etween electrons. Typical metals where correlations between conduction band
electrons are important are Fe and Ni.

Since the short range of the interaction is important it is relevant to study a
model, the so-called Hubbard model, where this physical fact is reflected in a simple

energies Eq. (4.42a), where it is clear th at the mean-field energy of a given spin
direction depends on the occupation of the opposite spin direction, whereas the energy
does not depend on the occupation of the same spin direction. This resulted from two
things: th e short range interaction and the exchange term. One can understand this
simply from the Pauli principle which ensures th at electrons with the same spin never
occupy the same spatial orbital and therefore, if the interaction is short-range, they
cannot interact. This leaves interactions between opposite spins as the only possibility.
Thus the interaction energy is lowered by having a polarized ground state, which on
the other hand for a fixed density costs kinetic energy. The competition between
the potential and the kinetic energy contributions is what gives rise to the phase
transition.
The Stoner model gives a reasonable account of metallic magnets. I t is also capable
of qualitatively explaining the properties of excitations in the spin polarized states,
but this outside the scope of this section.

FlC. 4.5. The three possible solutions of the Stoner model. The polarization is thus
a function of the interaction strength; the stronger the interaction the larger the
polarization. The Stoner model provides a clear physical picture for how the ex­
change interactions induce a ferromagnetic phase transition in a metal with strong
on-site interactions.
sufficient to understand the important physical features, at least those th at have to
do with static properties. In this chapter, we have seen how magnetism can be de­
scribed by mean-field theory. Another example is superconductivity, to be treated in
Section 18.3. We have also introduced the important concept of symmetry breaking,
which means that the system can lower its free energy by being in a state of lower
symmetry than th at of the original Hamiltonian.
This chapter is the last treating only stationary quantum states. In the remaining
part of the book we shall deal with the dynamical properties of many-particle sys­
tems. It turns out th at also for the time-dependent systems different Hartree Fock
type approximations can be evoked. One example is the so-called random phase ap­
proximation (RPA) treatm ent of the dielectric function in Sec. 8.5. In Chapter 14
the RPA result will be derived based on a more rigorous quantum field theoretical
approach.
Mean-field theory is treated in most bodes on many-body systems, also in those
quoted at the end of Chapter 1. An illuminating discussion on symmetry breaking in
condensed m atter systems is presented by Anderson (1984). while a reader interested
in magnetism could consult Yosida (1996) or Jensen and Mackintosh (1991).

Using the second quantization procedure, we have so far only treated energy eigen­
states with a trivial tim e dependence e_w f, instant processes a t a single time, and
systems where interactions are approximated by time-independent mean-held theory.
But how does one then treat th e general case o f tim e dependence in second quanti­
zation? T hat question will be addressed in this chapter, where the formal theory of
time evolution is discussed using three representations, or “pictures:" the Schrodinger
picture, the Heisenberg picture, and the interaction picture.
We also discuss some applications towards the end of the chapter, namely the
theory of scattering, which is needed in later chapters and, furthermore, we explain
Fourier transformations of retarded correlation functions, which are used extensively
in this book.

5.1

The Schrodinger picture

The Schrodinger picture is useful when dealing with a time-independent Hamiltonian
H , Le., Qt H = 0. Any other operator A may or may not depend on time. The state
vectors |t/»(£)) do depend on time, and their tim e evolution is governed by Schrodingcr's
equation. The time-independence of H leads to a simple formal solution:

iHB, |<t(!)) = H |V>(t))

=*

W t)) = «-*"■ fob).

(5.1)

In the following we will measure the energy in units of frequency, such th at h drops
out of the time-evolution equations: e /h —►e and H /k —►H . At the end of the
calculations one can easily convert frequencies hack to energies. W ith this notation
we can summarize the Schrodinger picture with its states |ti»(t)) and operators A as:
States:

{

|rb(t)) = c ‘Ht t o ) -

Operators: A , may or may not depend on time.
H , does not depend on time.

(®-^)

To interpret the operator e~iHt we recall th at a function f ( B ) of any operator B is
defined l»y the Taylor expansion of / ,

n=D

<5 -3 >

While the Schrodinger picture is quite useful for time-independent operators A, it may
sometimes be preferable to collect all tim e dependencies in the operators and work
with time-independent state vectors. We can do th at using the Heisenberg picture.
80

THE HEISENBERG PICTURE

5.2

81

T he H eisenberg picture

The central idea behind the Heisenberg picture is to obtain a representation where all
the time dependence is transferred to th e operators, A(t), leaving the state vectors |^ 0)
time independent. The Hamiltonian H remains tim e independent in the Heisenberg
picture. If the matrix elements of any operator between any two states are identical
in the two representations, then the two representations are fully equivalent. By using
Eq. (5.2) we obtain the identity

«/(()|.4|V (0) =

= « | / t ( t # 0).

(5.4)

Tlius we see th at the correspondence between the Heisenberg picture with timeindependent state vectors |^ 0), but time-dependent operators A (t), and the Schrodinger
picture is given by the unitary transformation operator exp{iH t),
States:

{

|t&0) = eiHt |tf(t)).

Operators: A(t) = eiHtA e~iHt.
H

(5-5)

does not depend on time.

As before, the original operator A may be time dependent. The important equation
of motion governing the time evolution of A(t) is easily established. Since H is time
independent, the total time derivative of A in the Heisenberg picture is denoted by a
dot, as in A, while the explicit tim e derivative of the original Schrodinger operator is
denoted as dt A:
=

+ BtA ) e - ,m ^ A(f) = i [ i M ( t ) ] + (0.A )(t),

(5.6)

where X (t) always means ciHtX e ~ iHt for any symbol X , in particular for X = d t A.
In this way, an explicit time dependence of A is taken into account. Note how carefully
the order of the operators is kept during the calculation.
Both the Schrodinger and the Heisenberg picture require a time-independent
Hamiltonian. In the general case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, we have to switch
to the interaction picture.

5.3

T he interaction picture

The third and last representation, th e interaction picture, is introduced to deal with
the situation where a system described by a time-independent Hamiltonian Ho, with
known energy eigenstates \tio), is perturbed by some, possibly time-dependent, inter­
action V'(t),
H = H 0 + V (t),

w ith J/ 0 |no> = e J n o ) .

(5.7)

The key idea behind the interaction picture is to separate the trivial time evolution
due to Ho from the intricate one due to V(t). This is obtained by using only Ho, not
the full H , in the unitary transformation Eq. (5.5). As a result, in the interaction

TIME DEPENDENCE IN QUANTUM THEORY

picture both the state vectors |V»(t)) and the operators A (t) depend on time. The
defining equations for the interaction picture are

does not depend on time.

The interaction picture and th e Heisenberg picture coincide when V = 0, i.e., in the
non-perturhed case. If V (t) is a weak perturbation, then one can think of Eq. (5.8)
as a way to pull out the fast, but trivial, tim e dependence due to H0. leaving states
th at vary only slowly in tim e due to K(t).
The first hint of the usefulness of the interaction picture comes from calculating
the time derivative of |$ (t)) using the definition Eq. (5.8):
■ W (O ) =

|V(0> +

+ f f)h « t) ) ,

(5.9)

which by Eq. (5.8) is reduced to
id tm )) = m

i^(t)>.

(5 . 1 0 )

The resulting Schrodinger equation for |tp(t)) thus contains explicit reference only to
the interaction p art V (t) of the full Hamiltonian H . This means th at in the interaction
picture the time evolution of a state |^(*o)) fr°m tim e t0 to t must be given in terms
of a unitary operator U (t, to) which also only depends on V (t). U(t, to) is completely
determined by

M t))= tf(M o ) W*o)).

(5-11)

When V and thus H are time independent, an explicit form for 0 ( t, f„) Is obtained
by inserting |^ (t)) = eiHot |V»(t)) = e‘Hot e~lHt |ib0) and ^ (to )} = eiH°to e~iHt• |^ 0)
into Eq. (5.11),

(5.12)

From this we ohserve th at (J~l —
Le., 0 is indeed a unitary operator.
In the general case with a time-dependent V{t), we must rely on the differen­
tial equation appearing when Eq. (5.11) is inserted in Eq. (5.10). We remark th at
Eq. (5.11) naturally implies the boundary condition U(to,to) = 1, and we obtain:
idt 0 ( t, to) = V (t) U (t, to),

tf(to, «o) = 1.

(5.13)

By integration of this differential equation we obtain the integral equation
U(t, to) = 1 + - f d t' f y t')

(5.11)

which we can solve iteratively for t/(t,to ) starting from u ( t',to ) = 1. The solution is

FlC. 5.1. The time-evolution operator U (t, to) in the form of Eq. (5.15) can he viewed
as the sum of additional phase factors due to V o n top of the trivial phase factors
arising from H0. The sum contains contributions from processes with 0 ,1 ,2 ,3 ,...
scattering events V , which happen during the evolution from time t0 to time t.

5.4

Time-evolution in linear response

In many applications the perturbation t^(t) is weak compared to H0. It can therefore
be justified to approximate 0 (t, t 0) by the first-order approximation
ffy .to ) = 1 + 1 J dt' V (t').

(5.19)

This simple time-evolution operator forms the basis for the Kubo formula in linear
response theory, which, as we shall see in the following chapters, is applicable to a
wide range of physical problems.

5.5

Tim e-dependent creation and annihilation operators

It is of fundamental interest to study how' the basic creation and annihilation operators
a* and a„ evolve in tim e given some set of basis states (|i/)} for a time-independent
Hamiltonian H. As in Section 1.3.4 these operators can he taken to be either bosonic
or fermionic. Let us first apply th e definition of the Heisenberg picture. Eq. (5.5):
a t (t) = eiHt a t e"*®*,

(5.20a)

o„(t) = eiHt av e " 4"* .

(5.20b)

In the case of a general time-independent Hamiltonian with complicated interaction
terms, the commutators \H, a* ] and [H,a„] are not simple, and consequently the
fundamental (anti-)commutator [a„(ti),aJ,(t2)]F.B involving two different times 11
and t2 cannot be given in a simple closed form:

eiHt,a v

e~iHt* ± e iWt*aJ, e~iH(ta~t,)av e~iHtl

??

(5.21)

No further reduction is possible in the general case. In fact, as we shall see in the
following chapters, calculating (anti-)commutators like Eq. (5.21) is the problem in
many-particle physics.

TIME-DEPENDENT CREATION AND ANNIHILATION OPERATORS

But let us investigate some simple cases to get a grasp of the time-evolution
pictures. Consider first a time-independent Hamiltonian H which is diagonal in the
|t/)-hasis,
H = J 2 ^ U u-

(5.22)

The equation of motion, Eq. (5.6), is straightforward : 10

By integration we obtain

(5.24)

which by Hcrmitian conjugation leads to
a t (t) = e + '^ a * .

(5.25)

In this very simple case the basic (anti-)commutator Eq. (5.21) can be evaluated
directly:
K.
Sw
(5.28)
For the diagonal Hamiltonian the tim e evolution is thus seen to be given by trivial
phase factors e± u t.
We can also gain some insight into the interaction picture by a trivial extension
of the simple model. Assume that
H = H0 + ~iH0,

7 « I,

(5.27)

where Ho is diagonalized in the basis (|i/)} with the eigenenergies e„. Obviously, the
full Hamiltonian H is also diagonalized in the same basis, but with the eigenenergies
(1 + j}£ . Let us however try to treat 7 / / 0 as a perturhation V to Ho, and then use
the interaction picture of Section 5.3. From Eq. (5.8) we then obtain
|«H t))= e*-* M O ).

(5.28)

But we actually know the tim e evolution of the Schrodinger state on the right-hand
side of the equation, so

|0(t)) = e " -'

(5.29)

Here we clearly see th at the fast Schrodinger time dependence given by the phase
factor c***1, is replaced in the interaction picture by the slow phase factor

operators and the second for fermionic operators (see Exercise 5.4).

TIME DEPENDENCE IN QUANTUM THEORY

Finally, we briefly point to the complications th a t arise when the interaction is
given by a time-independent operator V not diagonal in the same basis as H q. Consider
for example the Coulomb-like interaction w ritten symbolically as

The problem in this more general case is evident. T he equation of motion for the single

the tim e evolution of the three-operator product

down the equation of motion for this three-operator product we discover th at terms
are generated involving five-operator products. This feature is then repeated over and
over again generating a never-ending sequence of products containing seven, nine,

methods to deal with this problem.

F e rm i’s g o ld en ru le

Fermi’s golden rule is a very useful expression in lowest-order perturbation theory for
the transition rate T^ associated with a transition from an initial state |i) to a different
(and orthogonal) final state |/). The transition is due to some weak perturbation V (£)
th at couples |i) and |/ ) . The two states are eigenstates of the unperturbed system
described by a Hamiltonian H 0, so H0\u) = E v \v) with v = i or v = / .
The total Hamiltonian is H = Ho + V (t), and the perturbation is thought to
be adiabatically turned on at the distant past, so F(£) = V er,t, where V is a timeindependent operator and 77 is a small positive rate. Suppose the system in question
is in state |i) a t time £0. At some later tim e t > t0 this initial state has evolved into
|*(£)) according to Eqs. (5.8) and (5.11),
|i(i)) =

(5.32)

It is straightforward to determine the overlap between this state and a final state |/ ) .

The probability P f(t) to find the system in state |/ ) at tim e t is given by |(/|i(£ ))|2.
The time-derivative d P f(t)jd t is therefore the change in probability per unit time,

which wc interpret as the transition rate T between initial and final states. As
shown in Exercise 5.9, we arrive at Fermi's golden rule

If, furthermore, there is a continuum of equivalent final states one should sum over
these and thus the density of states appears in the expression because p(E%) =
Y l f H E f ~ £<)• This version of Fermi's golden rule is often used in scattering theory.
Here we give the more general expression and we emphasize th at Eq. (5.34) is not
limited to describing transitions between single-particle states, bu t is also valid for
transitions between many-body states. This is exploited further in Chapter 10.
5.7

T h e T - m a trix a n d t h e g e n e ra liz e d F e rm i’s g o ld en ru le

In this section, Fermi’s golden rule is generalized to include also higher-order pro­
cesses where the initial and final states are coupled by multiple scatterings on the
perturbation. However, the formal theory of scattering theory is rather involved, so
we restrict ourselves to deriving the so-called T-matrix using a physically motivated
formulation. It is our first encounter with higher-order perturbation theory in this
In order to derive a generalized Fermi’s golden rule, we wish to include all higher
orders in the perturbation V (t). Thus, instead of using Eq. (5.19) in Eq. (5.32), we
apply the expansion from Eq. (5.15). The overlap in Eq. (5.33) then becomes
</|i(<)> = ( / 1- j f * i ? (« ,) + p j T * . ? ( t , ) j f

? ( h ) + • ■-| i )

(5.35)
where we om itted the zeroth-order term in Eq. (5.15) because the initial and final
states are considered to be orthogonal.
At this point, we have to be careful with the formulation of how the perturbation
is turned on in the distant past. As above, we assume th at the interaction is turned on
slowly to avoid complication due to transients th at are not relevant for the discussion.
However, because many scattering events can take place between the time <o at which
the perturbation is turned on and the tim e t of the measurement, we have to make
sure th a t the “turning on” tim e
is well separated from the duration t —to of the
interaction, i.e., t — to 3>
and we thus take the limit to —►—oc before the limit
r) —¥ 0, while keeping t finite. One possible way to incorporate these conditions is to use
a functional form of V (t) different from the exponential that we used in the derivation
of the lowest-order Fermi’s golden rule. We can for example use V'(t) = / ( t ) . where
/ ( t ) = {1 + e x p [ - q ( t - t 0)]}~1. This Fermi-function turns on the perturbation around
tim e t 0 during a characteristic time interval rj~l .
We now incorporate the turning-on function f ( t ) explicitly in the expansion of the
overlap, Eq. (5.35). For a specific term
in this expansion.

we note th a t if the last factor f (t„ ) is turned on, most likely bo are all the other factors
f (ti) because they have time arguments larger than tn and because in the appropriate

TIME DEPENDENCE IN QUANTUM THEORY

88

limits their range is between to and t, which is much larger than rj~l . Using this
observation, we can replace f{U ) by unity when i / n. Furthermore, now th at we
have only a single turning-on time, we can for simplicity go back to the exponential
function, and let f ( t ) ~ exp(r/f) and to = - o o . W ith these steps Eq. (5.35) becomes

(5.40)

because by iteration this expression generates the same series as in Eq. (5.39).
The transition rate is now evaluated in the same fashion as in the previous section,
i.e., we identify T/i with time derivative of |( /|i(f ) )|2 . One finds
T/ , = 2 ir|( /|T |i) |2 S(Ef - E t).

(5.41)

This expression is the generalized Fermi’s golden rule; clearly, to lowest order in V
we recover Eq. (5.34). The T-m atrix and Eq. (5.41) is used in Chapter 10, where we
discuss higher-order tunneling effects.

F o u rie r tra n s fo rm s of a d v a n ce d a n d r e ta r d e d fu n c tio n s

In this book, we encounter different kinds of correlation functions and so-called
Green's functions; the first appearing in the Kubo formula in the following chapter.
Often we will perform Fourier transforms of these functions and therefore a discussion
of some general aspects of this is useful.
We consider first a so-called retarded function. T he name "retarded" means tliat,
in accordance with normal causality, it is a measure of a physical observable due to
the action of some force or interaction a t times prior to the measurement. The general
form of such functions is
c % ( t,f) = - # - 0

(5.42)

Here we have used an example, where the operators are bosonic operators, while
for fermionic operators the retarded functions are defined with an anti-commutators

F O U R IE R T R A N SF O R M S O F A D V A N C E D A N D R E T A R D E D F U N C T IO N S

89

instead of the usual commutators, see also Eq. (8.28). In Eq. (5.42), j4(t) and B ft) are
operators in the Heisenberg picture and the average (•) means the thermal average
defined in Eq. (1.118). The Hamiltonian thus enters in two places, namely through the
time dependence of the operators and through th e therm al average. In most cases, we
will consider situation where the Hamiltonian is time independent and therefore the
function C RBft, t') only depends on the time difference t —t'. This is easily proved by
writing out the definition of the average including the Heisenberg time-dependence.

(5 .4 3 )

where we have used the cyclic properties of the trace and th at the exponentials c * H
and
of course commute.
Since C j|B(t,f') thus depends on one tim e variable, we write it as C R(t — t') and
define the Fourier transform as
C j B(w) =

J —ac

dte**C%B(.t).

(5.44)

In order for the Fourier transform to be well-defined, the integrand must decay for
both plus and minus infinity. Of course, for the retarded functions which arc zero for
negative times, only plus infinity could pose a problem. In the limit of infinite time
difference, t —1‘ -* oo, we expect on physical grounds th a t there can be no correlation
between Aft) and B (t') and thus we expect th at
c U 1 . 0 -> - « ( « -

0[< ^W )(B (i')> - < B ( 0 ) < J l« ) ] = 0.

(5.45)

If this is true, the Fourier transform in Eq. (5.44) is well defined. W hether this asymp­
totic comes out correctly, depends on w hether the theory or model th at one uses has
built in some relaxation mechanisms th at destroy long tim e correlations. If not, corre­
lations can exist at infinite ranges and the function will not decay and typically it will
have some oscillatory dependence like C RBft —t’) cx exp(if(t - 1')]. Nevertheless, even
if the function is not decaying one can perform a Fourier transform if the frequency
is allowed to be complex. By replacing the real frequency u in Eq. (5.44) with the
complex frequency jj + iq, where t] is a positive real number, the Fourier transform
then reads

of course, be modified correspondingly. However, if we let rj be a positive infinitesimal

Another class of functions is the so-called advanced functions, which are defined
similarly to Eq. (5.42)

In this case the Fourier transformation is carried ou t in the same way, except now the

In this chapter, we have introduced the fundamental representations used in the de­
scription of tim e evolution in many-particle systems: the Schrodinger picture, Eq. (5.2),
the Heisenberg picture, Eq. (5.5), and the interaction picture, Eq. (5.8). Which pic­
ture to use depends on the problem at hand. The first two pictures rely on a timeindependent Hamiltonian H , while the interaction picture involves a time-dependent
Hamiltonian H of the form H = Ho + V (t). where Ho is a time-independent Hamil­
tonian. For the state vectors and the operators in the interaction picture we found

LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY
Linear response theory is an extremely widely used concept in all branches of physics.
It simply states th at the response to a weak external perturbation is proportional
to the perturbation, and therefore all one needs to understand is the proportionality
constant. Below we derive the general formula for the linear response of a quantum
system exerted by a perturbation. The physical question we ask is thus: given some ex­
ternal perturbation H ', what is the measured consequence for an observahlc quantity,
A. In other ivords, what is (A) to linear order in H'7
Among the numerous applications of the linear response formula, one can men­
tion charge and spin susceptibilities of, for instance, electron systems due to external
electric or magnetic fields. Responses to external mechanical forces or vibrations can
also be calculated using the very same formula. Here we utilize the formalism to
derive a general expression for the electrical conductivity and briefly mention other
applications.

6.1

The general K ubo formula

Consider a quantum system described by the (time independent) Hamiltonian Ho in
thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Sec. 1.5 this means th at an expectation
value of a physical quantity, described by the operator A, can be evaluated as
<A) = —

where po is the density operator and Z0 = TV [/>o] is the partition function. Here as in
Sec. 1.5, we write the density operator in terms of a complete set of eigenstates {|r»)}
of the Hamiltonian Ho with eigenenergies { E n } .
Suppose now th at at some time, t = to, an external perturbation is applied to the
system, driving it out of equilibrium. The perturbation is described by an additional
time-dependent terra in the Hamiltonian
H (t) = Ho + H ’( t) 0 ( t - to ) .

(6.2)

Wo emphasize th at Ho is the Hamiltonian describing the system before the perturba­
tion was applied (see Fig. 6.1 for an illustration). Nowr, we wish to find the expectation
value of the operator A a t times t greater th an to. In order to do so, we must find
the tim e evolution of the density m atrix or equivalently the time evolution of the

The philosophy behind this expression is as follows. The initial states of the system

nowr time-dependent and they have evolved according to the new Hamiltonian. The

This is the famous Kubo formula which expresses the linear response to a perturba­
tion, H'.
6.1.1

Kubo formula in the frequency domain

It is often convenient to express the response to an external disturbance in the fre­
quency domain. This is particulary useful when the external perturbation has the
form
H ’B (t) = B f ( t ) ,
(6.9)
where B is a time-independent operator and where the time-dependent function f ( t )
is not an operator. The response function
then becomes

where we anticipated that C $B(t, f ) only depends on the tim e difference, see Eq. (5.43).
When inserting Eq. (6.10) into the formula for the expectation value (6.7), and fur­
thermore letting to — —oc (which is reasonable if we are not interested in the transient
behavior), we have
t(A )(l) = j T

(6.11)

which is a convolution of the response function
and the function / and hence
the Fourier transform is

We can specialize this rem it to cases wrhere the external force depends on position
and direction. For example, instead of Eq. (6.9), we consider an external perturbation

Consider a system of charged particles, electrons say. which is subjected to an external

at tim e t depends on the electric field at points r ' at times t '. The linear relation

where a * (r. r — is the conductivity tensor th at describes the current response in

in frequency domain reads

The external electric field E is given by the electric potential 4>exi and the vector
potential A t.x,
E ....(r,I) = - V l f t , , ( r 1l ) - « 1A ,,1( r 1l).
(6.17)
The electric current is J e = -c (J to t), where J tot is the total current density operator.
For simplicity, we assume only one kind of particles, say electrons, but generalization
to several branches of charge carriers is straightforward.
After application of the perturbation th at drives the electrical current the total
vector potential is
A to t= A + A CIt,
(6.18)
where A denotes the vector potential in equdibrium. i.e. prior to the onset of the per­
turbation A<.„. The Hamiltonian describing the coupling to a vector potential was
introduced in Sec. 1.4.3, see Eq. (1.97). Inserting the total vector potential (6.18) in the
Hamiltonian (1.97) and keeping only linear terms in A<.xl (which is in Eq. (Eq. (1.96)),
we obtain the vector potential contribution to the perturbation. Also adding the po­
tential energy due to the external electrical potential, we arrive a t the total pertur­
bation Hamiltonian

W ith the perturbation Hamiltonian (6.19) and the total current operator (6.20),
we are now ready to use the linear response theory to calculate the conductivity. It
is somewhat unusual, because part of the perturbation also appears in the opera­
to r of which we want to calculate the expectation value and we therefore get two
contributions to J e = —e(J«o*), namely
= - e ( J ) ( t) - - A « t (r,()M r))o .
(6.21)
m
The last term is proportional to A rxt and therefore linear response result is found by
taking the expectation value of the density operator with respect to the equilibrium
Hamiltonian. To find the linear component of the first term in (6.20) we use the
general Kubo formula in Eq. (6.6). For this purpose it is convenient to choose a
specific gauge, namely one where the external electrical potential is zero
= 0.
This is always possible by a suitable choice of AeXt( r ,t) as seen in Eq. (6.17). The
final result does not, of course, depend on the choice of gauge. W ith this gauge choice
the linear response result for (J) due to the perturbation (6.19) becomes

(J(r»(i) = e / * ' J d t ' Y . c S(r)J. (H,(< - 0 A « ( r ', «').

where we used th at the equilibrium state does not carry any current21, i.e.(J)0 = 0.

Finally, to express the response in terms of the electric field, we Fourier transform
the relation between the external vector potential and the external electric field:
A«x,(h;) = Er*t(r,fa;)/»u>. W hen inserting this into Eq. (6.23) and comparing the
result with Eq. (6.15), we arrive at the final expression for the linear response formula
for the conductivity tensor

KUBO FORMULA FOR CONDUCTANCE

Finding the conductivity of a given system has thus been reduced to finding the
retarded current-current correlation function. This formula will be used extensively
in Chap. 14.
6.3 K u b o fo rm u la for c o n d u c ta n c e
For a given material the conductivity a is the proportionality coefficient between the
electric field E and the current density J . The conductivity thus describes an intrinsic
property of the material. The conductance on the other hand is the proportionality
coefficient between the current / through a given sample and the voltage V' applied
to it, i.e.. it is a sample-specific quantity. The conductance G is defined by the usual
Ohm 's law
I — GV.
(6.26)
For a materia] where the conductivity can be assumed to be local in space one can
find the conductance of a specific sample by the relation
W
G = -j-a ,

(6.27)

where L is the length of the sample, and W the area of the cross-section. For samples
which are inhomogeneous such th at this simple relation is not applicable, one must
use the Kubo formula for conductance rather th an th at for conductivity. One exam­
ple is the so-called mesoscopic conductors, which are systems smaller than a typical
thermalIzation or equilibration length, whereby a local description is inadequate.
The current passing through the sample is equal to the integrated current density
through a cross-section. Here we are interested in the DC-response only (or in fre­
quencies where the corresponding wavelength is much longer th an the sample size).
Because of current conservation we can, of course, choose any cross-section, and it
is convenient to choose an equipotential surface and to define a coordinate system
( f , a {), where £ is a coordinate parallel to the field line and where a ( are coordinates
on the plane perpendicular to the ^-direction (see Figure 6.2). In this coordinate sys­
tem the external electric field is directed along the ^-direction, EPXt(r) = £ £ ^ ( 1 ) .

where £ is a unit vector normal to the surface element daf and a is the conductivity

expression. If we furthermore take the real part of (6.28) we see th at what determines
the DC-current is the real part of the first term in Eq. (6.24) and hence the retarded
correlation function of the current densities. Since the total particle current at the

K ubo formula for th e dielectric function

When dealing with systems containing charged particles, as for example the electron
gas, one is often interested in the dielectric properties of th e system, and in particular
the linear response properties. When such a system is subjected to an external elec­
tromagnetic perturbation, the charge is redistributed and the system gets polarized.
This in turn affects the measurement, an effect known as screening. The typical exper­
iment is to exert an external potential 4>ext and measure the resulting total potential

The dielectric function expressed in Eq. (6.40)
includes all correlation effects, b u t often we must use some approximation to compute
the polarizability.
6.4.1

Dielectric function fo r translation-invariant system

In the translation-invariant case the polarizability can only depend on the differences
of the arguments, i.e. x f (rt, r 't ') = x * ( r - r';* - t ’), and therefore the problem is
considerably simplified by the use of frequency and momentum space, where both
Eqs. (6.35) have the form of convolutions. After Fourier transformation they become
*Iot(q,4>) = £ - ‘ (q,u)«)«t (q,w ),

or

Relation between dielectric function and conductivity

Both the dielectric function £ and the conductivity o give the response of a system to
an applied electromagnetic field, and one would therefore expect that they are related,
and of course they are. Here we consider again the translational-invariant case, and
using the definition of conductivity
J e(q,w ) = <r(q,w)Eext(q,w) = -i< r(q , w)q0.xt(q, u>),

(6.43)

and the continuity equation,

Finally, using Eq. (6.42) and knowing th at for an isotropic system, the conductivity
tensor is diagonal, we arrive at the relation
£"*(q,£j) = 1 - i — Vc(q)<r(q,u/).

(6.46)

So if we know the conductivity, we can find the dielectric response and trice versa.

We have developed a general method for calculating the response to weak pertur­
bations. This method, called linear response theory, is widely used because many
experimental investigations are done in th e linear response regime. In this regime the
lack of equilibrium is not important, and one can think of this as probing the individ­
ual excitations of the systems. Because the perturbation is weak, it is not necessary
to include interactions between these excitations.
The general formula,
(A (t))-{ A )0 =
where
c S m l f . !') = - « ( ! - < ') { [!(«), A W ] ) o ,
is a retarded correlation function of the quantity A (t) th at we measure and the quan­
tity //'(£), to which the weak external perturbation couples. In the case of conductivity
we saw that C R was the current-current correlation function, while the dielectric re­
sponse reduces to a charge-charge correlation. These two correlation functions will be
used later in Chapters 12 and 14, but already in the following two chapters we will
make use of the linear response result. In Chapter 7 we apply the Kubo formalism
for single-particle transport in mesoscopic systems, and in Chapter 8.4.1 we use it to
calculate the tunneling current between two conductors.

Electron transport in mesoscopic systems is a relatively new field of condensed m atter
physics. Since its beginning in the early 1980s many interesting and fundamental
results have emerged from this fascinating research area bordering to the macroscopic
classical world on one side and to the microscopic quantum world on the other. Here,
we combine this brief introduction to mesoscopic physics w ith our first in-depth use
of the Kubo formalism given in the previous chapter.
The physics of mesoscopic systems is a vast field and in this chapter we will
narrow the scope and focus on the Landauer-Biittiker single-particle formalism for the
conductance of nano-scale coherent systems. In Chapter 10 we will include correlation
effects to the discussion. By coherent we mean th at the quantum-mechanical coherence
length is longer than the sample size. The phenomena to be discussed in this chapter
all rely on quantum effects, all being clear manifestations of the propagation of electron
waves through the structures.

The field of mesoscopic transport is interesting in that it combines physics on
many length scales. The important length scales are the coherence length
the
energy relaxation length fin, the elastic mean free path t0, the Fermi wave length Xp
of the electron, the atomic Bohr radius ao, and of course the sample size C.
The typical mesoscopic structures th at we have in mind are fabricated on semi­
conductor chips, such as the electrostatically confined 2D electron gases described in
Section 2.3.2, or molecular systems, such as the carbon nanotube placed between two
metallic contacts shown in Fig. 2.12. At low tem peratures (e.g. between 50 mK and
4 K), the length scales of these system often fulfil the following inequalities defining
the mesoscopic regime,

oo « AF< ft. < £ < f* < fin.

(7.1)

Metallic systems are more difficult to bring into the mesoscopic regime because of
their small Fermi wavelength, AF « a0. However, there is one relatively simple exper­
iment involving a narrow metallic wire subject to an externally applied stress where,
as a clear signature of quantum transport, the conductance of the wire decreases in
pronounced steps of size 2e2/h just before the wire breaks. This can even he ob­
served at room tem perature, whereas the more sophisticated high-tech devices based
on semiconductor nanostructures only show quantum effects at low tem peratures as
shown in Fig. 7.2.
This chapter deals with the physics of single-particle quantum transport which can
be understood by invoking the Fermi liquid picture of non-interacting electrons. This
picture will be discussed in Chapter 15. When interactions are important, another
rich field of physics appears of which some topics are treated in Chapter 10.

We consider the standard setup in the field of mesoscopics, namely a mesoscopic sam­
ple connected to electron reservoirs (or contacts) in th e form of macroscopic metal
contacts. In the mesoscopic regime, the condition (7.1) is fulfilled per definition, and
this implies thAt we can consider the electron motion to be quantum mechanically
coherent in the entire sample. Furthermore, since the reservoirs are macroscopic con­
ductors, much larger than the entrance to the mesoscopic region, we can safely Assume
that electrons entering the reservoir will be thermalized a t the tem perature and chem­
ical potential of the contact before returning to the mesoscopic sample. The contact
is thus required to be reflectionless, meaning th at an electron impinging on a contact
will be fully ahsorbed and thermalized by the contact before being re-emitted into the
sample. Fig. 7.1 illustrates how a contact formed as a “horn" can give a reflectionless
contact reservoir. This way of treating conductance in mesoscopic systems is denoted
the two-probe Landauer-Biittiker formalism.
7.1.1

Definition o f the S-matrix

In the following, we solve for the eigenstates of energy £ in a geometry similar to
Fig. 7.1. Since the system is open, any real value of E is possible. The system is divided
into five regions: the left reservoir, left lead L, the mesoscopic sample M , the right
lead R, and the right reservoir. The role of the reservoir is ju st to provide thermalized
electrons to occupy the quantum states of the mesoscopic sample. For simplicity, the
leads are taken to be perfect straight segments, with the same constant cross-section $2
and impenetrable walls a t the boundary d ft.24 We use the coordinate vector r x for the
perpendicular coordinates in the y z plane such th at ( x ,y ,z ) = (x,rj_), where r x € 12
and x is the coordinate in the direction of a lead. The leads are denoted by a = L, R.
For each lead, the Hamiltonian H a and the associated eigenstates d*„g(x, r j . ) with
energy E and transverse mode quantum number n = 1 ,2 ,..., JV, are given by

FlG. 7.1. The geometry considered in the derivation of the Landauer formula. Two
reflectionless contacts each with A’ channels connect to a mesoscopic region. The
wavefunction is written as a superposition of incoming and outgoing wave at the
two entrances. When solving the Schrodinger equation, the system is separated in
three regions: L , R and M .
long as the change is adiabatic and the derivatives dT\ n can be neglected. For a
cross section with some symmetry, the transverse eigenenergies e„ can have degen­
eracies, but we choose the basis so th at the transverse wavefunctions are orthogonal:
(Xn|Xm) = <$nm- For calculations it will often be assumed that only a finite number
of transverse modes contribute for energetic reasons and therefore a cut-off value N
is chosen for the quantum numbers n. In summary, each lead has a set of eigenstates
with quantum numbers (n,
where tj = ± gives the direction of the current
carried by the state.
The wavefunctions 6 \ have been normalized in a particular manner so th a t they
all carry the same ahsolute probability current in a given cross section:

/ n *J-

= ± rn

(73)

Because of this normalization, it is more natural to label the states in terms of their
energy E rather than, as usual, their k values. T he transformation from a discrete to a
continuous set of energy levels looks a bit different in the two cases. In the following,
6k =
e,kg is a state with the usual normalization, while 6k =
eikr. The
length £ \ not to be confused with the length £ of the mesoscopic region, describes a
normalization length associated with the plane waves in the leads.

THE S-MATRIX AND SCATTERING STATES

As we shall see in detail later, the formulation of conductance in terms of the trans­
mission stems from the cancellation, seen in Eq. (7.4), of the k dependence of the
velocity, oc k, and th at of the density of states, oc dk/dE : a feature particular of one
spatial dimension.
The eigenfunctions in the complex middle region M are in general not easy to find,
hut fortunately, the general conductance formula can be established without speci­
fying them. All we will need is the transmission coefficients, relating the amplitudes
of the incoming and outgoing electron waves. Let us therefore introduce the so-called
scattering matrix or S-matrix formalism.
A given eigenstate t>£;(x,rx ) with energy E must be m atched together by a linear
combination of
in L, another linear combination of o ^ nE in R. and an unknown
complicated function tfr*f,£ in M . We can therefore write ^ e ( x , r x ) as

where o* and

the wavcfunction and its derivative must be continuous. For a given i/’A/.E in M this
condition gives 4 x N linearly independent equations to determine o* and 6*,

Fortunately, we need not solve this equation system, unless we want an explicit expres­

of the coefficients {a*} and {6*}. A particular useful way of representing the linear
dependence is through the so-called scattering m atrix, or S-matrix, which relates the
amplitudes of outgoing waves, <f>2 and (?£, to incoming waves.

Here we have defined the important dependent S m atrix to be a m atrix of size 2 N x 2N
with the N x N reflection matrices r and r' and transmission matrices t and t ' as
block elements,

106

TRANSPORT IN MESOSCOPIC SYSTEMS

The m atrix element t nn>represents the transmission amplitude for an incoming wave
from the left in state n ' to be transm itted into state n on the right hand side. The
amplitude for transmission in the opposite direction is given by f^n>. Similarly the
element r n„< gives the amplitude for being reflected back into the left lead in state n.
Due to Eqs. (7.6a)-(7.6d) the coefficients of the scattering m atrix are dearly energy
dependent. Most of the time, however, we suppress this dependence in the notation.
7.1.2 Definition o f the scattering states
We now define the so-called scattering states
= iba„E (not to be confused with
<t>ang). which are states with an incoming wave in one particular lead state a n , i.e.,
d n = ( 0 ,. .. , 0 ,1 ,0 ,...) . The lead index o refers to the lead from which the incoming
wave arrives. For the left lead a = L, the scattering states are

To determine the conductance of the mesoscopic system one needs to find V»a/,£ ( x . r± ),
which in genera] involves tedious, often numerical, work. However, as we shall sec in
the following, it is possible to derive some general results in terms of the the S-matrix

exact form of
7.1.3 Unitarity
o f of
thethe
S-matrix
Before we calculate the transport properties of a mesoscopic system, let us look at
some properties of the S-matrix. First of all. it must be unitary, i.e.. S ~ 1 = S*.
This is a consequence of probability current conservation. The incoming electron flux
5Zn |cta|2 = lc»n|2 must equal the outgoing flux
|CoUt|2 = |Cont|2 and therefore
c L c „ o t = < 4 c to

=>

< i ( l - S 'S jC i,, = 0 ,

(7.11)

and hence S* = S ' 1. From the unitarity follows some properties of r. r ', t. and t '.
which we will make use of below,
1 = rfr + t ft = r 'V + t 'V ,
0 = r V + t V = t^ r -f r'U,

SfS = 1

(7.12)

and furthermore
SB* = 1

«•

f 1 = r'rT +ttt = r r t + t't't,
I 0 = r t+ + t'r'+ = tr^-fr't^.

(7.13)

We also show the unitarity in a bit more explicit way by calculating the currents
on the left- and right-hand sides of the system. This we do because we will need the

THE S-MATRIX AND SCATTERING STATES

currents later on anyway. The particle current through a cross-section for a given
wavefunction ♦ ( * , r L) is, cf. Eq. (1.98b),
/(.) = j^ tr 1

J , * ( x ,r ± ),

J, = jjL ( a . - S .) .

(7.14)

where the arrows indicate to which side the differential operators are acting. For
a stationary state, i.e. an eigenstate with energy E, the continuity equation gives
dz J = —p = 0, and thus /(x ) cannot depend on x. Let us compute /(x ) for a state
with incoming coefficients Cm = (a + . b " j . First calculate the current 7t (x) entering
from the left contact by using Eq. (7.14) with = if)E for ( x ,r ± ) € L from Eq. (7.5),

used Eq. (7.7) to express the outgoing amplitudes a “ by the incoming ones r a + + t 'b “ .
Similarly, but now taking ( x ,r x ) € R in Eq. (7.5) and later replacing the outgoing
amplitudes b + by the incoming ones ta+ + r 'b ~ from Eq. (7.7), we obtain the current
I E entering in the right contact
/« (* ) = -

(7.16)

Expansion of the squared terms yields
I L = i | ( a * ) t ( l - r ' r ) B+ - ( b ' ) , ( t ' t t ' ) b - - 2 R e [ ( a +) t r t t ' b - ] } ,

(7.17a)

/« = A { (b -)* ( - 1 + i ^ O b " + (a+ ) f (t*t) a+ + 2R e [ (« + )’ t V b ' ] | .

(7.17b)

The continuity equation demands th at I L = —I r and for this to be true, for any value
of the coefficient matrices a * and b . th e terms in Eqs. (7.17) must match term by
term. This leads to Eq. (7.12) and hence S is unitary.
7.1.4

Time-reversal symmetry

Time-reversal symmetry' means th at H = 77*, because if 4»(r, t) is a solution to the
Schrodinger equation so is 4»*(r, —t). We shall show th at in this case the scattering
m atrix is not only unitary' hut also symmetric, S = Sr . This will be of importance for
the study in Chapter 16 of disordered systems with and w ithout an applied magnetic
field.
A non-zero magnetic field B = V x A breaks time-reversal symmetry, and in this
case, according to Eq. (1.90), the Schrodinger equation for an electron in steady state

» B + n ( r ) = [ - i ( V , * . * i ! + V (r)] * B(r) = E * b (t ).

It is seen th at HB — H * a . so it follows th at
f/B * B(r) = £ * u ( r )

H ^ B * l B(r) =

(7.19)

or in short: if <»B(r) is a solution so is ^!_B(r). We can therefore construct new
eigenstates by complex conjugation followed by reversal of the magnetic held. This is
perhaps not surprising, given the fact th at magnetic fields are generated by currents.
A complete treatm ent would take these currents into account, and the sign change of
B would follow automatically from the sign change of the currents. In our treatment
the magnetic held is taken as an external entity, and we must ensure the proper
behavior under tim e reversal by changing th e sign of B by hand.
Suppose we have an eigenstate which is a linear combination of incoming and
outgoing waves <I»B(r) = (cin^„, cout0out), then we can make a new eigenstate by
* " ‘g (r) = 4'B(r), which is a solution for - B . However, because complex conjugation
reverses the direction of propagation, the new incoming and outgoing wavefunctions
are c"°w = c*ut, and
= c*n. Since ’®new is a solution for —B, we have
C T = S _BC W

=>

C = S _ BC , = S _ BS^c,-„.

(7.20)

which shows that
S -B S& = 1

=>

S-- B = S B

*♦

S B = S -B

(™ )

In case of time-reversal symmetry B = 0, the scattering matrix therefore has an
additional symmetry besides unitary: it is also a symmetric matrix, SB_0 = S B._0.
7.2

C o n d u c ta n c e a n d tra n s m is s io n coefficients

Next, we calculate the conductance. This will be done in two different ways. First, we
will argue on physical grounds th at the population of the scattering states is given by
the equilibrium distribution functions of the reservoirs, which allows us to calculate
the current directly. Secondly, we calculate the conductance using linear response
theory, and, fortunately, we find the same result. While the first method is more
physically appealing, one could get in doubt whether the Pauli principle is treated
correctly. The linear response result shows th at indeed the first method gave the right
answer, at least in the linear response limit.
The answer we find, the celebrated Landauer formula, is very simple and physi­
cally sensible: the conductance of a mesoscopic sample is given by the sum of all the
transmission possibilities an electron has when propagating with an energy equal to
the chemical potential, E = fi,
GW = j E r . W

= ^

T V ltW 'tW ],

(7.22)

where, although often suppressed, the energy dependence is written explicitly, where h
has been reintroduced, and where the eigenvalues Tn of the m atrix t* t are introduced.

CONDUCTANCE AND TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENTS

The eigenvalues Tn should not be confused with the transmission probabilities,
i.e. the probability th at an electron in a given incoming state n ends up on the other
side. This probability is T„ = (tU ) , bu t the invariance of the trace in fact leads to
H n 7" - Yjn Tn. So we can write Eq. (7.22) in terms of Tn or T„ as we please.
The Landauer formula tells us th at the conductance of a mesoscopic sample is
quantized in units of 2e2/^- The number of quanta will be the number of transmis­
sion possibilities, denoted channels, connecting the two sides. However, since Tn is a
number between 0 and 1 one expect this quantization to show up only for some special
geometries where Tn is either 0 or 1. This is in fact what happens for the quantum
point contact, which is discussed below in Sec. 7.3.1. There, a particular smooth in­
terface between the two reservoirs which ensures th at T„ changes in a well-controlled
manner between 0 and 1. However, there are o ther examples w'here the conductance
quantum e2/h shows up, namely in the fluctuations of conductance. These fluctuations
are universal in the sense th at they have an amplitude of the order
independent
of the average conductance. This is discussed in Section 16.6.3.

e2/h

7.2.1

The Landauer formula, heuristic derivation

We argued above th at if the reservoirs are much wider than the mesoscopic region and
its leads, then we can assume reflectionless transmission from the leads to the reser­
voirs, i.e., the electrons entering the reservoir from the sample are always completely
thermallzed before returning. Thus all electrons coming from any given reservoir a
have a Fermi-Dirac energy distribution n F of th at particular reservoir, characterized
by the corresponding chemical /iQ. Furthermore, since the mesoscopic region is defined
to be phase coherent, no energy relaxation takes place there, and consequently elec­
trons originating from reservoir a maintain the distribution function of th at reservoir.
Therefore it is natural to express the occupation of the scattering eigenstates tpanE in
lead n by the distribution function f a and the chemical potential p a of the reservoir
connected to that lead.
/„(£ ) = nF( c - / i o ) ,

a = L ,R .

(7.23)

If we use the scattering states Eqs. (7.9) and (7.10) as our basis states, the cal­
culation of the current through the system becomes rather easy. By construction the
scattering states have very simple incoming coefficients (a + ,b ~ ). For example for
tf’tn E we have
(a+ ( f e E))„, = S „ „

( b (t>i„E))„. = 0.

(7.24)

Although ti’LnE contains many other coefficients than the incoming ones, the latter
ones suffice according to Eqs. (7.17a) and (7.17b) to calculate the current I m E carried
hy ipLnE if it is occupied by an electron. Due to current conservation, this current
is the same at any cross-section in the mesoscopic sample. Combining Eq. (7.24)
with Eqs. (7.17a) and (7.17b), we find expressions for Itn E at the left and right
lead, respectively. A completely analogous calculation yields the current /« nE for the
scattering state ipRnE coming from the right lead. The final result is

(7.28)

The sum over diagonal elements of (t*t) is simply the trace. Taking traces of the

where we have introduced the applied voltages as shifts of the equilibrium chemical

result, we perform a Taylor expansion of I c in eV around p, which then gives (after

Thus, we have derived the Landauer formula. It has been assumed th at the spin
degrees of freedom are degenerate which gives rise to a simple factor of 2. If they are
not degenerate, the trace must also include a trace over the spin degrees of freedom.
The expression Eq. (7.28) for current relies on the fact th at the scattering states
arc eigenstates of the system, which means th at we should not include any kind of

CONDUCTANCE AND TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENTS

111

blocking factors (1 —n F) to ensure th at the final state is empty, as one would normally
do in a Boltzmann equation. A scattering state extends over the entire sample, so once
it is occupied in one lead, it is automatically also occupied in the other. Thus we are
not talking about a scattering event from one reservoir to the other, bu t rather about
the therm al population of eigenmodes. In order to dismiss any concern about this
point, the next section is devoted to a derivation of Eq. (7.22) from first principles
using the linear response formalism of Chap. 6.

we could chose to calculate the current in the left lead. Again we consider the spin

G(0) = ~ T r [ t * t ] ,

(7.42)

which again is the Landauer formula. We have thus seen th at it can be derived mi­
croscopically, and any doubt about the validity of the treatm ent of the occupation
factor in the heuristic derivation, has been removed.
7.2.3 The Landauer Buttiker formalism fo r multiprobe systems
In the previous sections, our study was restricted to two-probe systems. T he lead index
o could only take the values L and R, bu t this can straightforwardly be extended to
multiprobe systems, such that a can take values corresponding to each of the leads in
the system. We will not go through the derivation in detail, since the reader should
be able to fill in the gaps.
Consider first the the two-probe formula (7.30) for the current I t in the left lead,
but now rewritten by use of Eq. (7.28) and linearization in the applied voltages, V t
and Vr :
=

( » [* ♦ * ] V i - l ^ f V ] V «).

(7.43)

The first term contains transmission processes starting in lead L and ending in lead
R, while the second term contains transmission in the opposite direction. The trace
'(A|V • J |V ) = -(A |flV ) = -<<A|[J/,pj|A') = - i ( £ A - £ v )(A|p|A') = 0 whon Ex = Ex, = p.

is written as TV(f^) = £ nn, t'n,nt nn, = £ nn. |tnn,|2, and the current can therefore he
written as

VR) = ^

■£ j ~ i E ( - | | ) (|l„.n.a i |J VL - |(„„. iR|2 V„).

(7.44)

The current in the left lead is thus seen to be the sum of the transmission probabilities
of going from any mode n in lead L to any mode n ' in lead R minus the probabilities
for the opposite processes.
This result is generally valid for the m ultiprobe case. T he current in lead a is found
by adding in a similar way the probability for all possible transitions between this lead
and any of the other leads a ' each with chemical potentials given by /*<,» = fi — cVa>,

being given in terms of the transmission probabilities. The formula is widely used in
the analysis of coherent transport in mesoscopic structures, but we will not go further
into this here, but instead proceed to study examples of two-probe geometries.

7.3.1

Quantum point contact and conductance quantization

One of the most striking consequences of the Landauer formula for conductance is
th at the conductance of a perfect channel is 2e2/h , and if there are N “perfect"
channels it is iV2e2/h . This has been experimentally tested in numerous experiments,
and it is now a well established fact. The first experiments showing this were done
by groups in Delft (Holland) and Cambridge (England) in 1988. The technique they
used was a so-called splitgate geometry, where a set of metallic gate electrodes was
put on top of a 2D electron gas such th at a narrow contact between the twro sides of
the 2DEC w'as formed; see Fig. 2.10(b). By applying voltage to the gates, the width of
the constriction could be controlled very accurately. As the width decreases, quantum
channels are squeezed out one by one, leading to a staircase of conductance, each step
being of height 2e2/h (see Fig. 7.2). We will now see how this nice effect can happen.
Suppose there is a smooth constriction between two electron reservoirs. Smooth
here means a horn-like shape, where the curvature at all points is large compared to
the wavelength of the wrave which is going to be transm itted through the horn. The
relevant wave equation for an electron horn is of course the Schrodinger equation,
but there is in principle no difference between the electron wave guide and horn wave
guides used in loud speakers, water waves, or other wrave phenomena. So the quantized
conductance is nothing but a manifestation of the wave nature of a quantum particle,
but a very striking one.

The transverse direction has thus been translated into an effective ID harrier. The

case, we can directly read off the transmission amplitude because in the notation
used for the scattering states, we have r = 0 and hence |f| = 1. The conductance is

which results in a step structure of th e conductance as a function of rJJ1" . This is

is changed by changing the width of
the constriction through the voltage of the gate electrodes.
Obviously the WKB approximation breaks down if p(x) is too small. Bight at the
point where a new channel opens, which happens when E y = e„(0). we would expect
some smearing of the step. The shape of th e smearing will, in general, depend on the
geometry of the constriction and is, in contrast to the step heights, not universal.
A useful model is the so-called saddle point model for the constriction, where the
confinement potential is modelled by

where Vo is a constant. The saddle point model can be thought of as a quadratic

low-temperature trace of conductance versus B-field for the ring. The amplitude
of the AB-oscillations can be of the order 20%. The overall dip of the conductance

For this model the smearing of the conductance steps thus has the form of a Ferini
function. Experiments using the splitgate geometry indeed show th at the conductance
traces (meaning conductance versus gate voltage) are well described by Eq. (7.58).
7.3.2

The Aharonov-Bohm effect

A particular nice example of interference effects in mesoscopic systems is the Aharonov
Bohm effect, where an applied magnetic field B is used to control the phase of two
interfering paths. The geometry is illustrated in Fig. 7.4. Each of the arms in the ring
could be an adiabatic wave guide, where th e wavefunction can be assumed to be of
the form in Eq. (7.55). Because of the applied B-field we must add a vector potential
A to the Schrddinger equation (7.46) as in Eq. (7.18).
At small magnetic fields, we can neglect the orbital changes induced by B in the
narrow- arms of the ring and the effect of the magnetic field thus only enters through
the flux enclosed by the ring. This particular limit is relatively easy to analyze, because
for the electron paths in the ring ending at r , the phase factor exp

“Classical” G reen’s functions

The Green's function method is very useful in the theory of ordinary and partial

It turns out to be a good idea instead to look for the solution G of a related but
simpler differential equation
V ? C (r ) = 4 (r ),
(8.2)
where <$(r) is the Dirac delta function. G (r) is called the Green’s function for the
Laplace operator V ,. This is a good idea, because once we have found C (r), the
electrical potential follows as

# r ) = - - / * ' G(r - r')ft(r').
Eq J

T hat this is a solution to Eq. (8.1) is easily verified by letting Vjj! act directly on the

C(k) = - - ,

G reen’s function for th e one-particle Schrodinger equation

Green's functions are particularly useful for problems where one looks for perturbation
theory solutions. Consider, e.g., the Schrodinger equation
[H0{t ) + V ( t ) ] * e = E * e ,

(8.7)

where we know the eigenstates of Ho, and where we want to treat V as a pertur­
bation. Here, we consider the case of an open system, i.e., there is a continuum of
120

GREEN’S FUNCTION FOR THE ONE-PARTICLE SCHRODINGER EQUATION 121

states and hence we are free to choose any E . This situation is relevant for scattering
problems where a flux of incoming particles (described by Ho) interacts with a sys­
tem (described by V ) . The interaction induces transitions from the incoming state
to different outgoing states. The procedure outlined below is then a systematic way
of calculating the effect of the interaction between the “beam" and the “target" on
the outgoing states.
In order to solve the Schrodinger equation, we define the corresponding Green's
function hy the differential equation
[a- - J/„(r)] C „(r, r’, E ) = fi(r - r ') ,

(8.8)

with the boundary condition Go(r, r') = G0(r', r). It is natural to identify the operator
[£ - Ho(r)] as the inverse of G0( r ,r ') , and therefore we write27
G a '( r ,E ) = E - H a{r)

or

G ^ ‘ ( r,E ) G 0( r,r',£ !) = J ( r - r ' ) .

(8.9)

Now, the Schrodinger equation can be rew ritten as
[ C f > ( r ,£ : ) - V ( r ) ] * B = 0,

(8.10)

and by inspection we see that the solution may be written as an integral expiation
* e (r) =

J

rfr'G „ ( r,r',B ) V ( r') # B (r'),

(8.11)

where 'b°E is an eigenstate to Ho with eigenenergy E. This is verified by inserting $ e
from Eq. (8.11) into the Gq ‘ ^E -term of Eq. (8.10) and then using Eq. (8.9).
One can then solve the integral equation Eq. (8.11) by iteration, and up to first
order in V the solution is

*£(<■>-

+ f *' C„(r,r',B)V(r0*t(O+ ° (V2),

(8.12)

W hat we have generated by the iteration procedure is nothing but the ordinary (nondegoncratc) perturbation theory. The next leading terms are also easily found hy
continuing the iteration procedure. The Green's function method is thus useful for
this kind of iterative calculations, and one can regard the Green’s functions Go of
the unperturlied system as simple building blocks, from which the solutions of more
complicated problems can be build.
Before we introduce the many-body G reen's function in the next section, we con­
tinue to study the case of non-interacting particles, bu t now including time depen­
dence. Again we consider the case where the Hamiltonian has a free-particle part H0
and a perturbation V, H = H0 + V. The time-dependent Schrodinger equation is
[ i f l ) - H „ ( r ) - V ( r ) ] # ( r ,t ) = 0.

(8.13)

27ln order to emphasize th e m atrix stru cture, we could have w ritten this as
fd r" Cg 1(r, r" ) G0 (r", r2) = rf(r —r'), where th e inverse G reen’s function is a function of
two arKumonts. But In the r-reprosentation It is in fact diagonal Gq 1 (r,r') = [E - H o(r)]6(r - r').

GREEN'S FUNCTIONS

Similar to Eq. (8.8) we define the Green's functions by
[id, - ff0(r)] G0(rt, rY ) = «5(r - r')6 (t - t').

(8.14a)

[id, - H0{t ) - V (r)]G (rt,rY ) = * (r - r > ( * - 0 -

(8.14b)

The inverse of the Green’s functions are thus
6V I ( r , l ) = i a t - / / n(r)

(S.15»)

G - ‘ (r,<) = it), - i / 0(r) - V'(r).

(8.15b)

FVom these building blocks we easily build the solution of the time-dependent Schrbdinger
equation. First we ohserve that the following expression is a solution to Eq. (8.13):
* ( r , t) = * ° ( r,() + j d r ' J d t ' C „ ( r l , r V ) V ( r ' ) * ( r (8.16)
or in terms of the full Green’s function
* ( r , l) = * ° ( r ,t) + J dr' J dt' C ( r , r '; t , t ') ''( r ') * V , « ') ,

(8.17)

both of which can be shown by inspection (see Exercise 8.1). As for the static case in
Eq. (8.11) we can iterate the solution and get
* = * " + G o v 't" + GoVGoVV0 + GoVGoVGoVty0 + ■• •
= * “ + (G0 + GoV'Go + G„VG0VG„ + • ■• ) V # °,

(8.18)

where the integration variables have been suppressed. By comparison with Eq. (8.17),
we see th a t the full Green’s function G is given by
G —G0 + G0V G0 4- G0V G0V G0 + • ■•
= G o + GoVr(Go + G0K G o+ •••).

(8.19)

Noting that the last parenthesis is nothing but G itself, we have derived the so-called
Dyson equation
G = G0 + GoVG.

(8.20)

This equation will play an important role, when we introduce the Feynman diagrams
later in the book. The Dyson equation can also be derived directly from Eqs. (8.14)
by multiplying Eq. (8.14b) with G0 from the left.
The Green’s function G (rf.r'f') defined here is the non-interacting version of the
retarded single-particle Green's function th at will be introduced in the following sec­
tion. It is also often called a propagator because it propagates the wavcfunction: if
the wavcfunction is known at some tim e f ', then the w-avefunction at a later time t is
given hy
9r(r,() =

J< i r 'C ( r i,i't') * ( r ',t') ,

(8.21)

which can be checked by inserting Eq. (8.21) into the Schrodinger equation and using
the definition Eq. (8.14b). T hat the Green’s function is nothing but a propagator is
immediately clear when we write it as28
“ Another way to write Eq. (8.21) Is simply: / dr'(r|e“iff(t-<')|r')(r,|'l<(t')) = (r|4»(t)).

C ( r t,rV ) = G ^ r t y f ) = -19(1 - t')(r|e ~ <i' “ ~ ''V > ,

(8-22)

which indeed is a solution of the partial differential equation defining the Green's
function, Eq. (8.14b), the proof being left as an exercise (see Exercise 8.2). Another
solution is
G ( r t,rV ) = C 'V l . r Y ) = « ( ( ' - t){ r|< r,H|,- ' ’>|r'>.
(8.23)
We have here lat>e!!ed the two solutions R and A. Here R means retarded, because the
presence of the particle at r a t time t depends on its position r ' at an earlier time t \
whereas advanced envokes a dependence on the postion r ' of the particle at a future
time t'.
The retarded Green’s function (8.22) thus expresses the amplitude for the particle
to be in state |r) a t time t, given th a t it was in the s tate Ir*) at time t/. We could, of
course, calculate the propagator in a different basis, e.g., suppose the particle initially
is in state
at tim e f : then the propagator for ending in state |<£n) is
C * H , n 't') -r - m { t - t?)(4n\e-‘KU- ‘"’\4n')-

(8.24)

The completeness of the basis states ensures th a t the Green’s functions Eqs. (8.22)
and (8.24) are related by a simple change of basis
C R( ri,r V ) = ^ ( r |4 .„ ) G H(n (,n V )(^ „ ,|r').

(8.25)

If we choose the eigenstates |<^>n) of the Hamiltonian as the basis states, the Green’s
function becomes
G R(rl, r '( ') = - . « ( ! - t ') ^ ; ( r | ^ ) ( 0 „ | r ' ) i !- ‘E"('-*’>.

(8.28)

8.2.1 Example: from the S-m atrix to the Green’s function
Propagation from one point to another in quantum mechanics is generally expressed
in terms of transmission amplitudes, as in Chapter 7. In fact, there is a general relation
th at links the S-matrix introduced in Chapter 7 and the asymptotic behavior of the
propagator or Green's function defined in Eq. (8.22).
Consider a simple example of a typical ID scattering problem, where an electron
incident from the left interacts with a barrier, located between x > 0 and x < W .
As in Eq. (7.9), the incoming wave is given by exp(iJtx) + r* e x p (- ik r) for x < 0,
while the outgoing wave on the other side, x > W , is given by exp(tArx), with k
being positive. Similarly, we define eigenstates for wave incoming from the right, with
reflection and transmission amplitudes denoted r'k and t?k , respectively. In short, we
have a one-dimensional version of the scattering states in Eqs. (7.9) and (7.10), with
eigenenergy E = k2/2m . Inserting these eigenstates into Eq. (8.26), one finds in the
asymptotic limit far from the scattering region (see Exercise 8.7 for details) th at for
x* < 0 and x > W

124

GREEN’S FUNCTIONS

about the transmission amplitudes for the particle. See also Exercise 12.2 for a specific
example. The generalization of Eq. (8.27) to the multi-channel case is in principle
straightforward. Instead of a single transmission amplitude, we have a matrix th at
contains amplitudes for transitions between different channels, as explained in the
previous chapter. However, for now we will end the discussion on the Green's function
for the single-particle Scrodinger equation, and instead move on and introduce the
many-body Green’s functions.

8.3

Single-particle G reen’s functions of m any-body system s

In many-particle physics we adopt the G reens function philosophy and define some
simple building blocks, also called Green's functions, from which we obtain solutions
to our problems. The Green's functions contain only part of the full information
carried by the wavefunctions of the systems but they include the relevant informa­
tion for the given problem. When we define the many-body Green’s functions, it
is not immediately clear th at they are solutions to differential equations as for the
Schrodinger-equation Green's functions defined above. But as we will see later, they
are in fact solutions of equations of motions with similar structure, and this is the
justification for denoting them Green’s functions. Let ub simply carry on and define
the different types of Green’s functions th at we will be working with.
There are various types of single-particle Green's functions. The retarded Green's
function is defined as20
C *(rT (, rV (') = -18(1 - 0 < [* „(* ),

{? :f™

n8,

(8.28)

where the (anti-) commutator [• • • , • • -]B f is defined as
\A ,B ) b = [ A , B \ = A B - B A ,
[v 4 ,B ]f= { A ,B } = A B + B A .

(8.29)

Similarly, we define a advanced Green's function as
G A(rat. rV Y ) = i» (t' - t)([* „ (rl), * i ,( r V ) ] s ,r ) ,

(8.30)

Notice the similarity between the many-body Green's function Eq. (8.28) and the
one for the propagator for the single-particle wavefunction. in Eq. (8.22). For non­
interacting particles they are indeed identical.
The second type of single-particle Green’s functions is the so-called greater and
lesser Green’s functions
G * [ v a t,v a t') = - i( # „ (r f )* t,( rV ) > ,

(8.31a)

C < ( n r t,r V t') = —* (±1) (> tt,(r't')* „ (rt)).

(8.31b)

We see th at the retarded and advanced Green’s function can be written in terms of
these two functions as
2BRocall the definition of the thermal average given in Eq. (1.118).

C ^ ( n r t ,r V l ') = 8{t‘ —t) [G T^nrt,r a t ' ) —G >{ r a t,r W t') ] .

(8.32b)

Even though we call these Green’s functions for “single-particle Green’s functions",
they are truly many-body objects because they describe the propagation of single
particles governed by the full many-body Hamiltonian. Therefore the single-particle
functions can include all sorts of correlation effects.
The Green’s functions in Eqs. (8.28), (8.31a), and (8.31b) are often referred to

point r ' at tim e t' to propagate to position r at tim e t. In this sense G R has its
name “retarded" because it is required th at t > f . The relation between the realspace retarded Green's function and the corresponding one in a general |Vv)~basis as
defined in Eq. (1.69) is analogously to Eq. (8.25) and given by

Green's function o f translation-invariant systems

For a system with translational invariance G’( r ,r ') can only depend on the difference
r - r ', and the k-representation becomes a natural basis:

follows th at C (k ,k ') = S ^ G { k ) , allowing us to write

Green's function o f free electrons

A particular case often encountered in the theory of quantum liquids, is the simple
case of free particles. Consider therefore the Hamiltonian for free electrons (or other
fermions)

and the corresponding greater function in k-space. which we denote G £ to indicate
th at it is the propagator of free electrons. Because the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the
quantum numbers k and a , so is the Green's function, and therefore
G f ( k a . t - t ') = - i { q „ , ( ( ) 4 k ( < ') ) -

(8.38)

Because of the simple form of the Hamiltonian we are able to find the tim e dependence
of the e-operators (see Eq. (5.24)),
cfe,(t) = e,W,ciU7c~<Wt =

and likewise

c£(t) = cjte<*hl.

(8.39)

Now G > becomes
(8.40)
and because the Hamiltonian is diagonal in k and th e occupation of free electrons is
given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution, we of course have {c^c^e) = 1 — rtF({k). In
exactly the same way, we can evaluate G J ,G ^ , and finally G q .

We see th at G > gives the propagation of electrons, because it requires an empty state
while G < gives the propagation of holes, because it is proportional to the number of
electrons. This is perhaps more clearly seen, if we write the definition a t T = 0 of, for
example. G q ,
C J ( k , k ', ( - ( ' ) = -i( G |c k(t)4 ,(t')|G > = -i( G |c ke - ‘»f‘- ,'> 4 ,|G )e‘E-I,- ,'>, (8.42)
which precisely is the overlap between a state with an added electron in state k ' and
with a state with an added electron in k and allowing tim e to evolve from t' to t. Here
|G) denotes the groundstate of the free electrons, i.e., the filled Fermi sea, |G) = |FS).
By Fourier transforming from the time domain to the frequency domain, we obtain
information about the possible energies of th e propagating particle. This is intuitively
clear from Eqs. (8.41), because the propagators evolve periodically in time with the
period given by the energy of the electron. For example in the frequency domain, the
electron propagator is
G f(lw , u ) = —2x1 [1 - n F(£k)] 4(£k - u ).

(8.43)

The corresponding r-dependent propagator, which expresses propagation of a particle
in real space, is given by

where d(e) =

and the interference function j sin (x) th at gives the amplitude of a spherical wave
spreading out from the point r \ See also Exercise 8.3.
8.3.3

The Lehmann representation

A method we will often be using when proving formal results is the so-called Lehmann
representation, which is just another name for using the set of eigenstates, (|n)}, of
the full Hamiltonian H as basis set. Let us for example study the diagonal Green's
function G >(iH,Vt'), which we write as

G >( v ; t,t>) = —i ^

In the frequency domain, we then obtain

iG >(v ,u ) = A (v ,u ) [1 —np(u/)],
—iG <(v ,u ) = A(i/,oj)np(u}).

(8.51a)
(8.51b)

These relations, known as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, relate the occupations
to the spectra] functions. The name of the theorem is better understood in the case
of bosons, where similar relations hold, see Exercise 8.4. Take, say, electromagnetic
modes described as bosons and consider the current-current Green’s function function.
In this case, the current fluctuations are given by the occupation number and the
dissipation is related to the retarded correlation, as shown in Chapter 6.
The Lehmann representation also gives the following general and useful relations.

The first one is easily derived from Eq. (8.48) by inserting 1 = / du;'S(u' + E „ - E„>)
inside the sum on the right hand and by comparing with the first line of Eq. (8.49). We
also note from these two relations th a t the retarded and advanced Green’s function
are simply the complex conjugate of one and another:

Gr{i/,u)= [Ga (i/,w )]*,

(8.53)

SINGLE-PARTICLE GREEN'S FUNCTIONS OF MANY-BODY SYSTEMS

129

or in the case of non-diagonal Green’s functions the corresponding relation is

CR{vy,w)=[CA(i/,i/,u)]‘,

(8.54)

which is proven by using the definition of the retarded and advanced Green's functions
(see Exercise 8.8).
8.3.4

The spectral function

The spectral function A (i/,u) can be thought of as either the quantum state resolution
of a particle with given energy u or as the energy resolution for a particle in a given
quantum number u. It gives an indication of how well the excitation created by adding
a particle in state v can be described by a free non-interacting particle. For example
the retarded propagator (8.41c) for free electrons,

C?(k<7,w) = -> f

= u _ ^ + tq<(8.55)

has the corresponding spectral function
i40(k<7,u/) = -2 h n G § ( k a ,u i) = 2nS(u> - fa ).

(8.56)

Thus for the idealized case of non-interacting free electrons, the spectral function is
a delta function, which tells us th a t an excitation with energy w can only happen by
adding an electron to the state k given by fa = w, as expected.
This result is true for any quadratic Hamiltonian, i.e., for non-interacting systems.
If we have for example

ff„ =

(8.57)

where v labels the eigenstates of the system, the spectral function is again given by
a simple delta function
A o(v , oj) = 2x5(u/ —fa ).
(8.58)
Generally, due to interactions, the spectral function differs from a delta function,
but it may still be a peaked function, which then indicates th at the non-interacting
approximation is not too far from the truth. In Chapter 15 this is discussed in much
more detail.
We will now show that the spectral function is a probability distribution. First,
as one must require, it is always positive. This follows from Eq. (8.48), the definition
Eq. (8.50) of the spectral function, and the fact th at (n |q ,|n ')(n '|c£ |n ) = |(n |c„ |n ')|2.
Second, it obeys the sum rule
°° dw
„ 2 ^ I,’W) = L

/

(8-59)

This formula is easily derived by considering the Lehmann representation of - 2 Irn G R
in Eq. (8.49),

= (<v4> + (4<V> = ( < v i+ 4<v) = 1,

(8.60)

where the last equality follows from the Fermi operator anti-commutation relations.
Alternatively, one can show Eq. (8.60) by using th at for any Fourier transform
f ( u ) in the frequency domain we have / ^ /(w ) = f ( t = 0) in the time domain, and
hence

r

C R( w ) = C R(i/,t.-0) = - i * ( 0 ) ( K , 4 ) } = - i x

1 x 1,

(8.61)

from which Eq. (8.60) follows. Of course, setting 0(0) = A, should be done with
some care, because it 0(x) is not well-defined for x —> 0, and therefore the derivation
Eq. (8.61) only serves as an easy way to remember the sum rule.
Remarkably, the spectral function is similar to the density of states at a given
energy. This is evident since for fermions the occupation n„ of a given state v is given
by Eq. (8.51b)
n„ = (c*c„) = - i G <( u ,t = 0)

= /*

|^ ( i / , u ) n F ( u ) .

(8.62)

The physical interpretation is th at the occupation of the quantum state |i/) is an
energy’ integral of the spectral density projected onto the state \v) weighted by the
occupation at the given energy. For a Fermi gas at low tem peratures, T < 7/.-. we
expect that if the state \v) is far below the Fermi surface, e.g., ev < E f . then
(c£cv) « 1. This in fact follows from the sum rule, because if ev
E y and the width
of A (i/,u>) is also small compared to E f then the Fermi function in Eq. (8.62) is
approximately unity and since A(i/, u ) integrates to 2n the expected result follows.
8.3.5

Broadening o f the spectral function

When interactions are present, the spectral function changes from the ideal delta
function to a broadened profile. One possible mechanism of broadening in a metal is
by e.g., electron-phonon interaction, which redistributes the spectral weight l)ecause
of energy exchange between the electron and the phonon system. Another mochanism
for broadening is the electron-electron interaction. See Chapter 15.

MEASURING THE SINGLE-PARTICLE SPECTRAL FUNCTION

131

As a simple example we consider a Green's function which decays in time due to
processes th a t scatter the particle out of the state v. In this situation the retarded
Green's function becomes
(8.63)
where r is the characteristic decay time. Such a decaying Green's function corresponds
to a finite width of the spectral function
A ( v ,<j ) = - 2 Im j

t) « 2 Im *

2I t
(u - 6 . ) 2 + ( i / t )2 '

(8.64)

Thus the width in energy space is given by r ~ l .
The simple notion of single electron propagators becomes less well defined for inter­
acting systems, which is reflected in a broadening of the spectral function. Amazingly,
the free electron picture is still a good description in many cases and in particular
for metals, which is quite surprising since the Coulomb interaction between the elec­
trons is a rather strong interaction. The reason for this will be discussed later in the
Chapter 15 on Fermi liquid theory. In other cases, the single-particle approximation
is not justified a t all. One such example is discussed in Chapter 19, where it shown
th at one-dimensional systems does not fall into the class of systems for which Fermi
liquid theory applies.

In order to probe the single-particle properties of a many-body system, say a solidstate sample, one must have a way of measuring how the electrons propagate as a
function of energy. In practice, this means taking out or inserting a particle with
definite energy. There are not too many ways of doing this, because most experi­
ments measure density or other two-particle properties. For example the response to
an electromagnetic field couples to the charge or current, which, as we saw in Chap­
ter 6, measures charge-charge or current-current correlation functions, b o th being
two-particle propagators.
In principle, there is only one way to measure the single-particle properties, which
is to insert/remove a single electron into/out of a many-body system. This can be
achieved by a so-called tunnel junction device or by subjecting the sample to a beam
of electrons. However, in some cases also optical experiments approximately measures
the single-particle density of states. For example, when a photon is absorbed and
an electron is kicked out from an occupied state to, e.g., a freely propagating state
outside the material as in the photo-electric effect.
In the following, we study in detail the tunneling case where an electron tunnels
from one material to the other and show how the tunneling current is expressed In
terms of the spectral functions and thus provides a direct measurement of these.

overlap in the insulator region. In the tunneling Hamiltonian this is modeled by
the matrix element T„u,.
8.4.1 Tunneling spectroscopy
The tunnel experiment setup consists of two conducting materials brought into close
contact, such th at electrons can tunnel from one to the other. This is illustrated in
Fig. 8.1. Systems 1 and 2 are described by their respective Hamiltonians, H\ and H2,
involving electron operators, Cj v and c ^ , where the single-particle states \v) and |/j)
are complete sets for system 1 and 2. respectively.
The coupling between the two sides of the junction is due to the finite overlap of
the wavefunctions, which gives rise to a term in th e Hamiltonian of the form

between the two systems. Therefore, we calculate the current to lowest order in the
coupling. The current operator itself is already linear in T„p and therefore we need
only one more order, which means th at linear response theory is applicable. According
to the general Kubo formula derived in Chapter 6 the particle current is to first order

In Eq. (8.74) we see th at the current is determined by two factors: the availability
of states, given by the difference of occupation functions, and by the density of states
at a given energy. Therefore by sweeping the voltage across the junction one gets
information about A {v ,u ). This is a widely used spectroscopic principle in, e.g., the
study of superconductors, where it was used to verify the famous prediction of the
BCS theory of superconductivity th at there is an excitation gap in the superconductor,
and th at the density of states peaks near the gap (see Section 18.4.3). Also it is used
to study small structures such as quantum dots, where the individual quantum levels
become visible due to size quantization.
The tunnel spectroscopy technique amounts to a sweep of an external voltage
which controls the chemical potential while measuring the differential conductance

While the single-particle G reen's functions defined above measure the properties of in­
dividual particles, the higher order Green’s functions give the response of the quantum
system to processes involving several particles. One important type of higher order
Green’s functions are the retarded correlation functions, which were encountered in
the linear response chapter. For example, we saw th at th e response to electromagnetic
radiation was determined by the retarded auto-correlation function of the charge and
current densities. Typical functions th at we will encounter are of the type
(8.78)
where A is some two-particle operator.
In order to treat a specific case, we evaluate the polarization function \ = CP(t
for a non-interacting electron gas, see Eq. (6.37b). This function gives for example
information about the dissipation due to an applied field, because the dissipation,
which is the real part of the conductivity,31 is according to Eq. (6.46) given hy (take
for simplicity the translation-invariant case)
Re a (q, w) =

Im x R(q, u ).

(8.79)

31 Because the power dissipated at any given point in space and time is P ( r,t) = J«(r,t) • E(r,t),
the total onorgy being dissipated is

In momentum space, the polarization is given by the Fourier transform of * ( r,r') ,

- Im Xo (q,w) = y X I ["*■(&) - “i ’Wk-Hi)] f ( 6 t - f t . , + w).

(8.86)

We can now analyze for what q and w excitations are possible, i.e., for which (q,w)
Eq. (8.86) is non-zero. Let us take T = 0 where n F is either zero or one. which means
th at rip(£k) - n f^ ii+ q ) Is only non-zero if (k > kF and |k + q| < k p ) or (k < kp
and |k + q| > k p ). The first case corresponds to u> < 0, while the latter corresponds
to ui > 0. However, because of the symmetry Im
(q,u/) = —Im Xo(-<\. -u>), which
is easily seen from Eq. (8.85), we need only study one case, for example u? > 0. The
delta function together with the second condition thus imply
(8.87)
The possible range of excitations in (q,uj)-space is shown in Fig. 8.3. The excitations
which give rise to the dissipation are electron-hole pair excitations, where an electron
within the Fermi sea is excited to a state outside the Fermi sea. There is a continuum
of such excitations given by conditions in Eq. (8.87).
While the electron-hole pair excitations are the only possible source of dissipa­
tion in the non-interacting electron gas, this is certainly not true for the interacting
case which is more complicated. There is one particular type of excitation which is
immensely important, namely the plasmon excitation. This we study in great detail
later in this book.
The excitation of the electrons gas can be measured by, e.g., inelastic light scatter­
ing (Raman scattering), where the change of momentum and energy of an incoming

photon is measured. The process discussed here where an electron within the Fermi
sea is scattering to an empty state outside the Fermi sea, is illustrated in the left hand
side of Fig. 8.3.

Sum m ary and outlook

The concept of Green’s functions in many-body physics has been introduced in this
chapter, and we will use Green’s functions in practically all discussions in the re­
maining part of the course. The Green’s functions describe the dynamical properties
of excitations. We have so far seen two examples of this: the density of states is re­
lated to the spectral function, and it can be measured for example in a tunneling
experiment, and second, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation is given by the
charge-charge retarded correlation function.
The physical picture to remember is th a t the Green’s function G (r at, r'er't') gives
the amplitude for propagation from the space-time point r ' f to rt, with initial spin
o ' and final spin a.
In this chapter, we have defined the following many-body Green’s functions
GR(TOt,Tfa rt ’) = —iO(t —

retarded Green’s function,

GA{rot,T,o >t') = i0(t' —t){[^CT(rt), 'P1!r,(r,t,)]i}ifr),

advanced Green’s function,

G> (ro t,u rV t/) = —t{ ^ £r{ r t ) ^ , ( r 't ') ) ,

greater Green’s function,

G <{Tat,a,T,tf) = —i (±1) {4,J.#(r,t,)i&<r(rt)))

lesser Green’s function

and their corresponding Fourier transforms. The important spectral function is in the
frequency domain and in a diagonal basis given by
A{v, ui) = —2 Im G r (l>,w),

spectral function.

The spectral function is related to the density of states. For non-interacting electrons
the spectral function is given by a Dirac delta function
A q( v,(jj) = 2 k 8(£v —u ),

non-interacting case.

We have also seen examples of how the Green’s functions enter physical observ­
ables. One example was tunneling experiments where the tunneling density of states
is given by the spectral function of the system. Also when calculating two-particle cor­
relation functions, we saw th a t the Green’s function enter as natural building blocks.
This is precisely the idea of the Green’s function, namely th at, for example, in pertur­
bation theory the Green’s functions come in as building blocks from which the theory
is built. This will be used extensively later in the book.

9
EQUATION OF MOTION THEORY
In the previous chapters, we saw how various physical observables can be expressed
in terms of retarded Green's functions. In many cases we need to calculate the time
dependence of these functions. There are several ways of attacking tills problem, one
of which is the equation of motion technique. The basic idea of this method is to
generate a series of coupled differential equations by differentiating the function at
hand a number of times. If these equations dose, the problem is in principle solvable;
and if not, one needs to invoke physical arguments to truncate the set of equations
in a reasonable fashion. For example, one can neglect certain correlations. We shall
study examples of both situations in this chapter.
9.1

T h e s in g le -p a rtic le G r e e n ’s fu n ctio n

Let us consider the retarded Green’s function G R (8.28) for either fermions or bosons,
G R( r i ,r 't') = - i 0(t - t')([* (r t )»

( 8 . 1)

We find the equation of motion for G R as the derivative with respect to the first time
argument

i0,CB(r<, rT) - (-1) [10,0(1- 0]([*(«), *VOla.r)
+ (-i) 0 ( t - 0< P ft* (rt), * , (rT )]B.f).

+ (-•)« (* - 0 < [ if t* ( r t) . * V 0 ]b .f ).

(0-2)

Here, we used that the derivative of a step function is a delta function and the com­
mutation relations for field operators at equal times [4»(r),4», (r') ] i| F = 6(r - r').
Next, let us study the time-derivative of the annihilation operator (throughout this
chapter we assume th at H is tim e independent),
i f t * ( r t ) = - [H, * (r)] (t) - -[H o , * (r)](t) - [H „ , *(»)]((),

(9.3)

where the interaction p art of the Hamiltonian includes all the interactions in the given
problem, while Ho describes the quadratic p art of the Hamiltonian, for example the
kinetic energy. If Ho is the usual kinetic energy Hamiltonian of free particles, we have

(9.4)

139

EQUATION OF MOTION THEORY

140

In this case, the equation of motion becomes
( ift +

C fl( r t ,i V ) = &(t - f ) S ( r - r ') + D B(r< .rY ),

(9.5»)

D B(rl. rV ) = - » ( < - f ) { [ - [ V ,.,* ( r ) |( i ) , * • (rY )] „.F) ■ (9.5b)
The function D R thus equals the corrections to the free-particle Green's function.
After evaluating [V^m, 4*(r)] we can, as in Section 5.5, continue the generation of
differential equations. It is now evident why the many-body functions G R are called
Green’s functions. The equation in (9.5a) has the structure of the classical Green's
function, th at we saw in Section 8.1, where the Green's function of a differential
operator, L, was defined as "L G equals a delta function
Often, it is convenient to work in some other basis, say {i>}. The Hamiltonian is
again written as H = Ho + Vlnt, where the quadratic p art of the Hamiltonian is
S . = E W « 1 .V
VV>

(9-6)

Of course, the Hamiltonian Ho can include both the kinetic energy contribution and
the single-particle potential energy, which are both quadratic In creation and anni­
hilation operators. The differential equation forthe Green’s function in this basis,

(9.9b)
In this book, we will mainly deal with problems where the Hamiltonian does not
depend explicitly on tim e (linear response was an exception, bu t even there the timedependent problem was transformed into a retarded correlation function of a timeindependent problem). Therefore, the Green's function can only depend on the time
difference t - t ' , and in this case it is always useful to work with the Fourier transforms.
Recall, that when performing the Fourier transformation, the derivative 9t becomes
-iw , and the delta function becomes unity, S(t) -> 1, so we can write the equation of
motion in frequency domain as.

Here it is important to remember th a t the frequency of the retarded functions must
carry a small positive imaginary part, tj, to ensure proper convergence (see Sec­
tion 5.8).
9.1.1

Non-interacting particles

For non-interacting particles, which means th at the Hamiltonian is bilinear in anni­
hilation or creation operators, we can in fact solve for the Green’s function.32 In this
case we have
£ (*„„■■(w + b!) - <W ,
(9.11)
V"

where the subindex 0 on G R indicates th at it is the Green’B function corresponding
to a non-interacting Hamiltonian. As in Section 8.1 we define the Inverse Green’s
function as
(G o)
( w /;u ) = <W(o> + ii)) - W = ( G ^ J , ,(9.12)
and in matrix notation, Eq. (9.11) becomes
(G § )~ 1G R = 1.

(9.13)

Therefore, in order to find the Green’s function, all we need to do is to invert the
matrix (G R)~ ^ . For a diagonal basis in which tvv>=
8VV>, the solution is
(G f)^ =

c[ + iv K s -

(9.14)

which, of course, agrees with the result foimd in Eq. (8.55).

9.2

Single level coupled to a continuum

To illustrate how the equation of motion theory can be used to determine the Green’s
function, we now study a model, which we will use several times in the book, namely
H = Ho + J/hyb + Hi,

(9.15)

where Ho describes a non-interacting electron gas.

«0 = 53O 4<V .

(9.16)

MHoro wo only consider terms of the form etc but also anomalous terms like cc could bo Included.
Such a term Is Indeed relevant for superconductors. We return to this in Chapter 18.

Hi is the Hamiltonian of a single localized level,

(9.17)

and Hhyb describes the hybridization or tunneling between the localized level and the
continuum of states,
f l h j b = X ) K 4 CI +

(9 -1 8 )

We are interested in finding the diagonal Green’s function for the local state. To do
th at, we need the following two retarded Green’s functions,
G a ( l , l , t - t ' ) = - t e ( f - ( ') ( { c i(t),cJ(t')}).

(9.19a)

G R(l>, I, t - «') = -iO (t - t')({c„(J), cftt")}).

(9.19b)

appropriate for fermions.
The equations of motion are now found by letting v and v" in Eq. (9.11) run over
both the continuum states v and the localized state I, and we obtain the coupled
equations
(u + i < i- ( 0)G R{ l , l , u ) - Y , ‘»Gn {v,l,w ) = 1,

(9.20a)

(ai + it) - {„) G R(lt, 1,ui) - t ‘ G n lI, I, u ) = 0.

(9.20b)

It is now a simple m atter to solve the last equation and insert it into the first. We
obtain

(9.22)

The function £ fi(u>) is our first encounter with the concept known as “self-energy.”
The self-energy changes the pole of G R{1,1) and furthermore gives some broadening to
the spectral function. In the time domain, the imaginary part translates into a lifetime.
It arises because the coupling to the continuum states introduces off-diagonal terms in
the Hamiltonian, so th at it is no longer diagonal in the /-operator. The true diagonal
modes are instead superpositions of u- and /-states.

In order to exemplify the usefulness of the equation of motion technique, we proceed by
applying it to a famous model for the appearance of a magnetic moment of impurities
of certain magnetic ions embedded in a non-magnetic host metal. The host metal,

FlC. 9.1. The Anderson model describing magnetic impurities embedded in a homo­
geneous host metal, (a) The electrons in the conduction band of the non-magnctic
host metal (horizontal lines) couple to the magnetic impurity ions (circles), each
having zero, one, or two valence electrons (vertical arrows), (b) The bare onsite
energy of the state on the magnetic ion is e j. But the energy of electrons residing
on the impurity ion also depends on whether it is doubly occupied or not, therefore
the state with two electrons residing on the ion has energy 2ej + U.
e.g., Nb or Mo, has a conduction band, which can be described by an effective non­
interacting model

(0-23)
kcr

For the impurity ion we assume th at it has only one spin-degenerate state in the
active shell, which is typically the d shell. In addition to the bare energy cost for an
electron to reside in the d-state, there is an interaction energy th at depends on the
state being doubly occupied or not. The Hamiltonian Hd + H u for the impurity ion
d is thus modelled as

Hd+Hu= (ed- (i)

+Und\nd±
,

(9.24)

where nda =
is the number operator for d-electrons on the ion. T he crucial
input here is the correlation between electrons on the impurity ion. because the inter­
action in the narrower d-shell of a magnetic ion is particular strong, and this is in fact
the reason for the magnetism. The states forming the conduction hand arc primarily
s-states th at are more extended in space, and hence interactions arc less important
for those.
The electrons occupying the conduction band couple to the outermost electrons of
the magnetic impurity ions, e.g., the d-shell of an Fe ion. The coupling occurs because
the d-orhital and the conduction band states overlap spatially and also lie close in
energy, giving rise to a ‘•hybridization” between the two. The overlapping orbitals
lead to a non-diagonal m atrix element of the Hamiltonian,

+ U > 2 Furthermore,
the system gains further kinetic energy by th e hybridization, which on the other
hand is complicated by the fact th at the hopping in and out of the impurity orbital
with, say, spin-up electrons, depends on the occupation of spin-down electrons. The
hybridization therefore seems to randomize the spin on the magnetic ion.
The Hamiltonian H formed by the sum of these three energy contributions.

is known as the Anderson model (see Fig. 9.1 for an illustration). Although the Ander­
son model looks simple, its full solution is very complicated, and in fact the model lias
a very rich phase diagram. The Anderson model has been used to describe numerous
effects in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems.
It turns out that, for certain values of the parameters, it is energetically favorable
for the system to have a magnetic moment (and thus minimizing the on-site interaction
energy) while for other values there is no magnetic moment (thus gaining maximum
hybridization energy). The physical question we try to answer here is: under which
circumstances is the material magnetic?
9.3.1

The equation o f motion fo r the Anderson model

The magnetization in the 2 -direction is given by the expectation value of the difference
n-f— between spin-up and spin-down occupancy. T he occupation of a quantum state
was found in Eq. (8.62) in terms of the spectral function. For the d-electron occupation
we therefore have
("*r) = j — A(do,u;)nF{uj),

(9.27)

where A(da, u ) is the spectral function, which follows from the retarded Green's func­
tion, G r (see Eq. (8.50)). All we need to find is then
C R(da ;t — f ) = - i » ( t - ? )

(9.28)

Let us write the equation of motion o f this function using Eq. (9.10). Due to
the hybridization term , the Hamiltonian is not diagonal in the d-operators. and the
equations of motion will involve another Green's function, namely
G R( k » ,d r ,t - f ) =

.«(« - f ) ( { c , , „ ( t ) . i ( 0 } ) -

(9.29)

The equations of motion are thus found by letting v" in Eq. (9.10) run over both d
and k and we obtain the coupled equations

We thus face the following more complicated Green's function,

9.3.2 Mean-field approximation fo r the Anderson model
Differentiating the function in Eq. (9.34) with respect to time would generate yet
another function to be determined, and the set of equations does not close. This is
investigated further in Chapter 10, where the same model is used to describe transport
in interacting mesoscopic systems. Here, however, we use the model to describe a
very different physical situation, where many (weakly interacting) magnetic impurities
reside in a host metal. For this situation, a mean-field approximation grasps the
important physics th at the spin-up electron population depends on the spin-down
population, and therefore we replace th e interaction p art H u by its mean-field version
H ( fF = U (ndt)

+ U fad;) n ^ - U fadf) fad;) •

(9.35)

When writing the mean-field decoupling in this way, it is im portant to realize th at we
have implicitly assumed that the system might spontaneously break the symmetry,
if we allow for solutions with (n<ff) ^ faaj.). Naturally, this cannot occur for a single
impurity, because the Hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to interchanging up
and down spin. Therefore, it takes a macroscopic sample to break the symmetry, as
discussed in Section 4.4, which is the situation we have in mind here.
W ith this approximation, the function D R becomes
dV

-M -O =

({ < * < « ),4 ,(1 ')} )
(9.36)

In other words, since the mean-field approximation makes the Hamiltonian quadratic
we can include U ( n ^ (t)) to the energy of the spin-up d-electrons in our equation of
motion. Inserting (9.36) in Eq. (9.30) and solving Eq. (9.31) for G R{d^fu ) gives

and likewise for the spin-down Green’s function. The final answer is
(9.38a)
(9.38b)
The function T,R (w) is recognized as the self-energy in Eq. (9.22). As mentioned, the
self-energy changes the pole and broadens G R. The “bare" d-electron energy frf is

EQUATION OF MOTION THEORY

146

thus seen to he renormalized by two effects: first, the energy is shifted by U (ndi) due
to the interaction with the averaged density of electrons having opposite spin, and
second, the coupling to the conduction band electrons gives through E(w) an energy
shift and most importantly an imaginary part.
Assuming that the coupling ?k only depends on the length of k and thus on £k.
the self-energy E is

(0.39)

The density of states d (e) and the coupling m atrix element t (f) depend on the details
of the material, but fortunately it is not important for the present considerations. Let
us assume that the product d(e) |t(e)|2 is constant within the band limits, given by
- D < e < D, such that we can write
2tt<((£) |(( e) |2

f T, for —D < E < D,
\ 0, for D < |e|.

(9.40)

This approximation is good, if the width of the Green’s function (which we shall see
shortly is given by T) turns ou t to be small compared to the scale on which d(e) |t(e)|a
typically changes. Since in practice T <$: £p, the approximation is indeed valid. For

(9.41)

The real part gives a shift of energy, and since it is a slowly varying function, we
simply include it as a shift of e j and define the new onsite energy £ = £</ + Re E w.
The spectral function hence becomes

For Z > 8 the effect of having more than two d-orbitals in the Fe atoms becomes
important and the simple model is no longer adequate.

The two-particle retarded correlation functions, such as the density-density correla­
tion, was in Chapter 6 shown to give the linear response properties. Also for this
quantity, one can generate a set of equation of motions, and as for the single-particle
Green's function they are not solvable in general. But even so, they may provide a
good starting point for various approximation schemes.
Consider for example the retarded charge-charge correlation function
x V . r V ) = - » ( 1 - f ) ( [p(rt), M rV )] )■

In Chapter 6 it was shown th at this function is related to the dielectric response
function and therefore tells about the screening properties of the material.
9.4.1

The random phase approximation

A commonly used approximation scheme for correlation functions is the so-called
random phase approximation (RPA). For the case of the electron gas, which is one
of our main topics in this book, RPA is exact in some limits, but also in general
gives a decent description of the interacting electron gas. In Chapter 13, RPA is
derived using Feynman diagrams, bu t here we derive it using the equation of motion
technique. T he two derivations give complementary insight into the physical content
of the approximation.
We will for simplicity work with the translation-invariant electron gas and with
the Hamiltonian given by the usual kinetic energy plus interaction energy (here, we
disregard for the moment the spin degree of freedom because it is not important for
the discussion),

Likewise for each level of the equation of motion, a new Green’s function with two
additional electron operators pops up. Here, a t this stage we truncate the series by

This is the RPA result for the polarizability function. The free particle polarizability

Replacing the expectation values (n^) and (r»k+q) by the Fermi Dirac distribu­
tion function, we recognize the Lindhard function studied in Section 8.5. There we
studied a non-interacting electron gas and found th at x R(q. w) indeed was equal to
the numerator in (9.57), and the two results therefore agree nicely.
Also in Section 8.5 did we analyze the excitation of the non-interacting electrons
gas, and th at analysis is basically still correct. The excitations, shown in Section 8.5
to be related to the imaginary p art of x R(q, <*>) and thus related to the structure of the
electron-hole excitations of the non-interacting gas (depicted in Fig. 8.3), is preserved
here, but of course the strength is now modified by the real part of the denominator
of (9.57).
However, the interactions add other fundamental excitations, namely collective
modes, and in the case of a charge liquid these modes are the plasmon modes. These
additional collective modes are given by the part where the imaginary p art of Xo*(q,w)
is zero because then there is a possibility of a pole in the polarizability. If we for brevity
set Im x£ (q ,w ) = - S , we can write

oscillation mode, also called a plasmon, which is treated further in Chapter 14

Sum m ary and outlook

In this chapter, we have seen a method to deal with the dynamical aspects of in­
teracting many-body systems, namely the equation of motion method applied to the
Green's functions. The set of differential equation is not soluble in general, and in fact
only a very small set of Hamiltonians describing interacting systems can be solved
exactly. Therefore approximations are necessary, and we saw particular examples of
this, namely the mean-field solution of Anderson's model for a magnetic impurity em­
bedded in a metallic host, and the RPA approximation for the charge auto correlation
function. The Anderson model will be studied further in Chapter 10, where we will
focus more on transport in interacting mesoscopic systems.
In Chapter 11, we use the equation of motion to derive the Green's functions in the
imaginary time formalism and to derive the famous Wick’s theorem. Wick's theorem
will then pave the way for introducing the Feynman diagrams.

TRANSPORT IN INTERACTING MESOSCOPIC SYSTEMS
In Chapter 7 we studied transport of electrons through phase coherent mesoscopic
systems. The underlying assumption was th at the charge carriers could be viewed as
non-interacting particles. This assumption is generally valid for extended systems34
at low temperatures. In the case of mesoscopic systems or nanostructures, "extended”
should be thought of as many channels or at least a few' almost open channels that
connect the system to the electron reservoirs of the leads. W hen this is no longer
the case, interactions play a dominant role for the transport properties. This is easily
understood physically, because if the charge tends to be localized on the nanostruc­
ture, the flow of electrons becomes correlated due to the Coulomb interactions. The
degree of correlation is controlled by the Coulomb energy cost for adding or removing
electrons. This energy can become considerable, of order of meV for small systems
such as semiconductor quantum dots, or even as large as eV for molecular devices.
Because of this charging effect, it is not permissible to think about the particles as
independent entities, and hence a many-body approach is needed. In this chapter, we
shall study a few examples th at illustrate the importance of many-body physics, and
discuss the different theoretical tools available.

10.1

M odel H am iltonians

As in C hapter 7, we study a system consisting of a middle region connected by leads to
large electron reservoirs. The leads themselves are assumed to be metallic systems, in
which the electrons can be regarded as non-interacting. In contrast, the middle region
is a nanostructure where interaction effects may be important. The interactions can
be either electron-electron interactions, or, if the charge on the structure couples
to mechanical vibrations, it could be electron-phonon interactions. The connection
between lead and interacting region is given by a tunneling term th at allows electrons
to be exchanged. The system is illustrated in Fig. 10.1 . The Hamiltonian we are going
to study throughout this chapter is thus given by
H = Hl + H r + H d + Ht ,

(10.1)

where H L and H R are the Hamiltonians for the left and right leads, respectively,
H d is the Hamiltonian describing the “dot” region and, finally, H t is the tunneling
Hamiltonian for the two the junctions, see Section 8.4.1. The states in the uncoupled
dot, the left lead, and the right lead are defined by the fermion operators c£c . cf,L and
c ln , respectively. The tunneling Hamiltonian H r coupling these three subsystems is
given by
34Horo, “extended" means 3D metals, where Fermi liquid theory Is applicable, see Chapter IS.

in the middle region ( “dot” ) interactions may be present. The three regions are
connected by tunneling processes described by tunneling Hamiltonians H t l and
H t r . In addition there is a gate electrode, which by its voltage Vg is used to
change the electrostatic potential of the nanostructure. Such systems are realized
in semiconductor quantum dots or in molecular electronics devices. An example
of such a nanoelectronic device is shown in Fig. 2.12(c).

Tb simplify our discussion, we restrict ourselves to two interaction models. The
first model is the so-called constant-interaction model or capacitor model,

SEQUENTIAL TUNNELING: THE COULOMB BLOCKADE REGIME

153

(10.7)

which is nothing hut the charging energy for a capacitor with charge Q = —e
n„,
and where Ec = e2/2 C is the energy associated with charging a capacitor C hy a
single electron. This model is most relevant when there are many single particle levels
within the energy window of interest, or when the system is sufficiently disordered,
such that the charge distribution can be approximated by a smeared distribution
similar to electrostatic energy minimum configuration.
The second interaction model to be studied is an Anderson-type model, similar
to the one discussed in Section 9.3, the only difference being th at *the magnetic
impurity", which is now our nanostructure, is connected to two metallic electron
reservoirs with separate chemical potentials. For this model, the dot Hamiltonian is
ffn = ] T ( ^ c ^ c ^ + U n ^ iiJ t ,

( 10. 8 )

where Cda is the operator associated with the dot-level.
In the following, we discuss different approaches for calculating transport proper­
ties of these model systems.
10.2

The sequential tunneling regime, which is equivalent to the weak tunneling regime,
assumes that time spent on the dot between tunneling event is assumed to be the
largest time scale in the problem, larger th an coherence times in the mesoscopic sys­
tems. As a consequence, coherence between successive tunneling events is not passible.
This means that we can describe the mesoscopic system by a distribution function
th at gives the probability of finding the system in a particular state a . The distri­
bution function is denoted P (a ). In equilibrium this is. of course, nothing but the
Boltzmann distribution function in Eq. (1.113). However, the out-of-equilibrium con­
ditions become important when a voltage bias is applied across the system, and w’e
must determine the non-equilibrium distribution function. In order to do so, we look
at transitions between the various a-states, and since we consider the weak tunneling
limit, we can use Fermi's golden rule with the tunneling Hamiltonian as a pertur­
bation, see Section 5.6. The transition between two states a and? due to tunneling
through the left junction is

(10.9)

where the sum over initial states runs over all configurations of the internal degrees
of freedom in th at give the state a , each weighted by a therm al distribution function
Wia . Similarly, we sum over configurations of the final states th at give the final state
8 . The meaning of this will become clear in the two examples considered below.

where the T-coefficients originate from tunneling through either of the contacts.
The master equations are rather self-explanatory: the first term on the righthand side gives the rate at which the state a decays. This is proportional to the
probability th at the system is in state a in the first place, multiplied by the rates
for transitions from o to any other statq3 . The second term gives the rate for the
opposite process, i.e., the rate at which the system ends up in state a given th at is
started in some other statq9 . The m aster equations are to be understood as semiclassical equations, because we assume th at in between tunneling events, the state of
the Bystem can be described by classical probabilities, P (a ). The approach is similar
in spirit to the Boltzmann equation discussed in Chapter 15. Later in this chapter, we
go beyond the semi-classical approach and discuss the situation where the tunneling
rate Is comparable to energy differences of the mesoscopic system.
The only situation we study here is steady state where d P (a )/d t = 0, and thus

From this set of linear equations for P (a ) in combination with the normalization

10.2.1

Coulomb blockade fo r a metallic dot

We start by looking a t the classical model for Coulomb blockade in a metallic dot
(the results are summarized in Fig. 10.2). Here, “metallic" means th at there is a con­
tinuous density of electronic states in the dot. Between the rare tunneling events, the
occupancy of the states in the dot are assumed to relax to a Fermi Dirac distribution.
The only unknown variable of the mesoscopic system is therefore the number JV of
electrons on the dot. The Hamiltonian is given by the constant-interaction model,
f fg B = E ^ ‘l 'V + E(Ar),

(10.12)

E(N) = ECN 2 - r.V,N,

(10.13)

where we have included the gate voltage Vc explicitly. The gate voltage gives rise to
an electric field th at increases the energy of the electrons residing on the d o t.31
Tunneling onto the dot will increase the number of electrons on the dot by one. The
rates for these processes are calculated using Eq. (10.9) with ia = i y and $ — /jv+i- 36
36In the actual experim ental set-up, e V a is a combination o f the source, d rain, and g ale volt­
ages together w ith th e respective m utual capacitances. Here we lum p all this into one gate voltago

However, the sum over occupation of the dot state is restricted to a given number of

If we, furthermore, define the total rates as the sum of left and right contributions,

then the master equation finally becomes

The solution of this set of equations is, by inspection, seen to be given by the following
recursive relation:
TN- i , N P(N) = ^ n , n - i P{N - 1).

Once P(N) is determined, the current through the device can be found as the
current through, say, the left junction

(10.26)

where the first term gives the rate for electrons entering the dot through the left
tunnel junction, while the last term correspondingly gives the rate at which electrons
leave the dot through the same contact.
Coulomb blockade for a metallic dot results in an oscillatory dependence as a
function of gate voltage. The optimum number of particles follows from Eq. (10.13):
Afopt = cVg/2 E c . When this is an integer there is an energy gap for adding electrons,
whereas when A^opt is a half-integer two charge states are degenerate and current can
flow. The solution of the Coulomb model Eqs. (10.25) and (10.26) for a metallic dot is
shown in Fig. 10.2. The occupations of the different states near the optimum numlwr
are shown in the leftmost panel, with No being an integer. The middle panel shows
the conductance of the system, which is seen to peak when N'opt Is a half integer. The
rightmost figure shows a density plot of the differential conductance dl/dV , where
the Coulomb gap is seen as dark areas. This is a plot often used to characterize the
addition Bpectrum of such single electron transistors (see also Fig. 10.6).

10.2.2

Coulomb blockade fo r a quantum dot

When the dot is so small th at the single particle levels inside are resolved, one cannot
use the result from the previous section, where a metallic dot was considered. Instead,
one has to define a probability function P (a ) for each configuration of occupations of
the single particle levels inside the dot. Here, |a) means a specific many-body state of
the dot, so for each charge N it could be the groundstate or one of the excited states
of the JV-particle system. For a dot with a discrete set of eigenstates, the tunneling
rates are different from the metallic dot case, because we do not assume th at the
states arc distributed according to a Fermi Dirac distribution. Instead, we have to
find the distribution functions P (o ) from the m aster equation.
The tunneling rate for tunneling between dot states |a D /v) and.f 0 . N + 1) through
the left lmrricr. follows from Eq. (10.9). Here we have indicated the number of electrons
in the dot as a subscript to the dot states. The final state is c„t |i/,)lj D . N + 1). where
|i t ) is the initial lead state an d # D , N + i ) the final dot state. We have

of states is constant. W ith this simplification the transition rate I^w+j a N becomes

Similarly, we have for the transition rate for decreasing the numher of particles as

W ith this result, we are now' able to solve the m aster equation for a given problem.
In principle, the calculation follows the method used in the previous metallic case,
bu t we will not go into specific details here. We do, however, recommend the reader to
do Exercise 10.2, where an example of a dot with a single resolved level is considered.
See also the original paper by Beenakker (1991).
10.3 C o h e re n t m an y -b o d y tr a n s p o r t p h e n o m e n a
Until now, we have dealt with the regime w'here the tunneling in and out of the
dot is incoherent. However, for stronger coupling to the leads this is no longer a
correct description, because when the tunneling coupling energy becomes larger than
the thermal energy and the bias voltage, the delocalization of the charge due to
quantum processes cannot be disregarded. For very strong coupling the Coulomb
blockade itself may be strongly modified and even disappear completely. Tb illustrate
the importance of higher order tunneling processes, we begin by discussing the socalled cotunneling processes. A cotunneling process is a higher order tunneling process,
where the electron is transferred from one side of the structure to the other. Since
the intermediate state, where the electron is on the dot itself, has an energy which is
larger than the initial energy, this is a virtual process. Using second order perturbation
theory, such processes give a contribution of order t2/U , where t is the tunneling
amplitude for each tunneling and U is the energy of the intermediate state.30
10.3.1 Cotunneling
Above we used Fermi’s golden rule, which is valid to second order in the tunneling
Hamiltonian. To higher orders, the tunneling Hamiltonian is replaced by the T-matrix
introduced in Section 5.7. The T-m atrix is given self-consistently by
T = H t + Ht

The cotunncling process is illustrated in Fig. 10.3. There are two different ways th at
an electron can get from, say, left to right: (1) first an electron is transferred from left

(10.33)

Furthermore, the cotunneling processes are either elastic or inelastic. Elastic means
th at the energies of the initial and final electron state in the leads are the same, while
inelastic means th at these energies are different. In the latter case the energy- of the
dot has been changed by the process, e.g., by the appearance of an electron-hole pair
(see Fig. 10.3). A special type of elastic cotunneling involves a spin flip during the
process. This process will be discussed thoroughly in connection with the Hondo effect
in Section 10.5.
10.3.2

Inelastic cotunneling fo r a metallic dot

We start by looking a t cotunneling in metallic dots. Because metallic dots by definition
have a continuum of states, there is a large phase space for inelastic processes (Averin
and Nazarov 1990). T he process of inelastic cotunneling is illustrated in Fig. 10.3.
The final state is an electron-hole pair on the dot, plus one electron transferred from
the left to the right electrode, i.e.,
l/> = 4 « C™ 4 „ C.J,I0.

(10.34)

Using the same set of approximations as was used in deriving the tunneling rates, T,
to fourth order in H r , we have (see Exercise 10.3)

As is evident from this expression, the current is a non-linear function of voltage.
For the linear response, one can thus neglect the cotunneling effect. The prediction
for the cotunneling current at small values of T has been verified in great detail
experimentally, and only at the degeneracy points, where one of the denominators
in Eq. (10.36) is zero, does the present approach break down, and one must go to
higher orders in the tunneling Hamiltonian. This interesting many-body problem is,
however, not discussed further here.
10.3.3 Elastic cotunneling fo r a quantum dot
For a non-metallic dot, i.e., for a mesoscopic system with discrete eigenstates, inelastic
cotunneling is of course also possible. However, because the spectrum is discrete there
is in this case a threshold voltage for leaving the quantum dot in an excited state.
We will not go further into this here, but instead tu rn to elastic processes, which are
allowed even in linear response.
Above we considered the case, when an electron-hole excitation was created in the
dot. If. however, it is the same electron level in the dot th at is emptied and filled, no
energy is dissipated in the dot, and the cotunneling is thus “elastic." This possibility
is not relevant for a metallic dot,37 but for a dot with a discrete spectrum it can
become relevant. To illustrate this, we take our other extreme model — the single
dot-level model
with dot-level i/j having energy sd. For the elastic case the final
state is then
l/> = < V „ |.} .
(10.37)

In contrast to Eq. (10.33) there is only one term here, because the process where the
electron is first moved from dot to lead cannot happen in this case, simply because
the dot is empty to begin with. When inserting Eq. (10.37) we obtain

Since (»o|tvR<iR|*o) is either one or zero, we can remove the square, | •|2, in Eq. (10.39)

convert the sums to integrals we arrive at

The important points to notice here are th at the cotunneling current is linear in the
bias voltage and th at there is current even when it should be blocked by the Coulomb
blockade. In this sense, the cotunneling effect is a leakage current. However, when the
tunneling coupling becomes even stronger the perturbative treatm ent in r £ and TR is
no longer a good starting point and new methods have to applied. These methods are
developed in the remaining part of the chapter. See also Fig. 10.8 where the various
regimes for transport through a quantum dot are shown.

make the following rotation in the space of L- and i?-electron operators,

(10.43)

TRANSPORT IN INTERACTING MESOSCOPIC SYSTEMS

The rotation is thus done for each pair uL and vR, and each pair is labelled by
the quantum numbers, v and the even or odd labels e or o, respectively. If we for
simplicity let the two electrodes have identical dispersion relations
= £„b , the
lead Hamiltonians transform as

tftB =

(ia44)
which easily follows from the unitary of the transformation in Eq. (10.43). The reason
for introducing the transformation in the first place is th at the tunneling Hamiltonian
now only involves the even sector of the lead electrons, i.e.,
«T = E

+ l‘« P

+ cL <v) •

(W.45)

W hat has been achieved is th at the Hamiltonian has been separated into two inde­
pendent sectors: one which involves only a non-interacting electron gas of the odd
combination of lead electrons, and one which is a single level coupled to a single
electron reservoir made out of the even states. The latter is then nothing but the
well-known Anderson model with a single electron reservoir.
10.4.1

The conductance in linear response

The next step is to calculate the conductance of the structure. Here, we concentrate
on the linear response limit, and later we briefly comment on the generalization to the
non-linear transport regime. In Section 6.3, the conductance was shown to be given
by the retarded current-current correlation function C $ . In Eq. (8.67) the current
operator for a tunneling system was found. We define particle-current operators for
the left and right leads by It = N L and I r = N r , and they follow from Eq. (8.67)

(10.46)
In the case of a time-independent voltage, we can calculate the expectation value of
the current in any of the leads, or we can use any linear combination of the two, i.e.,
/ = a l L - (1 —q ) / r . By a clever choice of a , namely a = \tR\2l[ \tL\2 + |t/j|2}, the
current becomes a function of the odd electron combination only,
/ = ^ |( |2 + |tji|2

(10.47)

The current-current correlation function now simplifies greatly, because the c.„ and
the dot operators belong to separate parts of the Hamiltonian. In the same spirit as
in Section 8.4.1, we write the current operators as / = —i(L —L '), and we obtain

(10.48)

where the expectation value is with respect to the full Hamiltonian, but without
the voltage terra. Since (L(t)L(O)) = 0, because it does not conserve the number of
particles, we reduce Eq. (10.48) to
C fiW = -■'»(*) ( ( [ £ ( i) ,£ * ( 0 ) ] ) + ([£ '(< ), £ ( 0 )] ) ).

The other term in Eq. (10.49) follows from Eq. (10.50) by a change of sign and t —> —t.
In the frequency domain we thus find

(10.51)

W h at using that (G >(i/,t))* = (-i(c „ (t)c i))* = *(<v«i(*)> = - G >( u ,- t ) and simi­
larly (G<(i/,t))* = —G <( v ,—t), we see th a t the expression in the square parenthesis
is purely imaginary and also an odd function of t. These observations arc used to
write the imaginary part of C $(u/) as

The Fourier transform of a product is / dte1^ 1f ( t ) g ( - t) = f ( d u '/2 n ) f( u + u/)g(tt/),

Similar to Eq. (8.74), we use the relation Eq. (8.51) to substitute the Green's functions

(10.54)

Since we should insert Im C j j into the Kubo formula (6.30) for conductance and take
the limit oj -* 0, we expand Eq. (10.54) to first order in u . Furthermore, we also use
th at the decoupled lead electrons are described by a non-interacting electron gas, i.e.,
A(vna, u ) = 2n6(uj — )• W ith these two steps we arrive at

W hen converting the sum over lead states to an integral

single level in the dot including Coulomb interactions,

Tills b a quite remarkable result because it directly relates the spectral function
of the mesoscopic system to the conductance. Note th at no approximations have been
made apart from the initial one th at the tunneling amplitudes are constant and spin
independent and the left and right leads have identical dispersion relations. Therefore,
the spectral function should be calculated in th e presence of tunnel couplings to the
leads, and the expression in Eq. (10.56) thus enables us to study the conductance
through a mesoscopic system to any order in hybridization term H jAbove we have calculated the linear response conductance, bu t it can in fact be
generalized to finite bias voltage as well. This was done by Meir and Wingrecn (1092),
who showed that the following very intuitive result,

gives the current at any voltage bias. Here fiL and p R are th e chemical potentials of
the left and right reservoirs, respectively. However, in order to derive this result one

THE CONDUCTANCE FOR ANDERSON-TYPE MODELS

needs non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism which is outside the scope of this
book. Interested readers can consult, e.g., the book by Haug and Jauho (Haug and
Jauho 1996).
10.4.2

Calculation o f Coulomb blockade peaks

In order to calculate the conductance G using Eq. (10.56), it is necessary to determine
the spectral function A. Tb do this we must first find the retarded Green’s function
C r (A M ) = -ifl(t) {{<:*((), 4 > ) .

(10.58)

Let us sta rt from the equation of motion theory in Section 9.3.1 and Eqs. (9.30)
and (9.31). But instead of performing the mean-field approximation in Eq. (9.36) we
take it one step further. The mean-field approach is not appropriate here, because
the current through the dot depends crucially on the correlations. Clearly, if U is
large (compared to T), and the mean occupation is close to unity, the motion of the
electrons hopping through the dot will be correlated so th at there is never more than
one electron a t any given time on the dot. This type of correlated motion cannot be
captured by the mean-field approximation, where the electrons only interact with the
mean occupation. The situation here, where we are studying a single dot, is thus very
different from the case studied in Section 9.3, where we considered an ensemble of
magnetic impurities. We therefore iterate the equations of motion one step further
and look a t the equation of motion for the function D R, defined in Eq. (9.34),

leads to the definition of the function

(10-61)

while the second term gives rise to a new type of correlation. In fact, it corresponds
to higher-order correlations, where the spin on the quantum dot flips during the
tunneling process. For now these more intricate correlation functions will be omitted,
but in Section 10.5 we shall deal w ith it wrhen discussing the Kondo effect in quantum

FlC. 10.4. The conductance and occupation of the quantum dot Anderson model.
Each curve is calculated on the basis of Eqs. (10.56) and (10.69) for a given value
of U /T\ the dashed line is U /T = 0, while the others are U /T = 2, 5, and 10,

U /T a two-peak structure develops with an increasing peak spacing, (b) The cor­
responding occupations (rido) exhibiting an increased smearing as U /T increases.
We have used T = 0 in the plot.
the second term is the density of states for adding electrons when the dot is already
occupied by an electron with spin down. In the first situation the spectral function
is centered around the single particle energy, £d+, while in the second situation the
Coulomb interaction energy U is added. The result is thus seen to be an improvement
of the mean-field expression in Eq. (9.42), which has a single peak. Only when T » U
do the two results become the same.
The two peaks in the spectral function correspond to the Coulomb-blockade physics
discussed previously. The first peak reflects the presence of a possible channel for con­
ductance when the empty state and the singly occupied states are degenerate, whereas
the second peak comes from the second possible channel which is open when the singly
and doubly occupied states are degenerate. Experimentally, one can move iietwecn
the peaks by adjusting £d. which in practice is done through the gate voltage. The
Lorentzian shape of the peaks then gives the tunneling broadening that we were inter­
ested in, and which is beyond the master-equation approach. The conductance 1wised
on the tunnel-broadened spectral function is shown in Fig. 10.4.
The result for the same model using th e master-equation approach is considered in
Exercise 10.2. Here it is shown th at any given conductance peak is broadened by the
tem perature only, and th at its height increases linearly with the inverse temperature.
This of course cannot be correct at very low tem peratures k T < T, where the peak
height must be limited by I \ But we see a nice correspondence between the two
approaches: in the weak tunneling limit, T «c k T , the more general result derived
in this section reduces to the master-equation result given in Exercise 10.2. This
correspondence is the topic of Exercise 10.6.
Finally, note th at one should also solve the occupation which enters in Eq. (10.69)
sclf-consistently. The occupation is given by

(nda) =f ^ nF{u)A{da,u>),

(10.70)

TRANSPORT IN INTERACTING MESOSCOPIC SYSTEMS

which therefore constitutes two coupled linear equations, one for each spin. In Fig. 10.4,
we show the results for the conductance using the formulae derived in this section;
see also Exercise 10.7. On the figure it is seen how the conductance with its two-peak
structure deviates from the mean-field approximation, which always leads to only one
peak.

10.5

T he Kondo effect in quantum dots

In Section 10.3.1 we discussed cotunneling processes for both metallic dots and quan­
tum dots. We saw th at higher order tunneling gave rise to a "leakage” current, which
was present even when the semiclassical theory predicted th at the current was blocked.
This physics was further developed in Section 10.4.2, where we studied tunneling
broadening of the Coulomb blockade peaks. There is, however, one very interesting
phenomenon, which is not covered by any of the approaches we h aw considered so
far, namely the so-called Kondo resonance. This occurs in the case when the quantum
dot has an average occupation close to an odd integer number of electrons. The state
with an odd integer of electrons is degenerate due to spin degeneracy, and the fluctu­
ations between the two degenerate states cause the resonance. The Kondo resonance
or Kondo effect is a well-known effect from the study of resistivity of metals due to
scattering off magnetic impurities. There the scattering has an anomalous effect on
the low-temperature resistivity: it causes the resistivity to increase with decreasing
temperatures. This effect was explained by Kondo in 1964, using a model for the
interaction between the conduction electron and the localized magnetic moment; a
model which is now known as the Kondo model. The anomalous behavior turns out
to be an intriguing many-body effect. For a review of the Kondo effect in metals, see,
e.g., the hook by Hewson (1993).
The quantum dot with a single electron occupying the top-most quantum state is,
in fact, similar to the spin one-half magnetic impurity. But in contrast to the increased
resistivity for the magnetic impurities, the increased scattering in the mesoscopic de­
vices gives rise to an increased conductance. In the following we establish explicitly
the correspondence between the scattering against magnetic impurities and tunnel­
ing through a quantum dot. We also show, how the anomalous scattering arises by
performing a perturbation theory calculation to third order in the exchange coupling.
Furthermore, we briefly direct the reader to more advanced treatm ents, i.e., beyond
the perturbation theory, of the Kondo problem.
10.5.1

Prom the Anderson model to the Kondo model

In order to study the physics in the region, where the quantum dot is occupied by an
odd numlwr of electrons, we start from the Anderson model in the range of parameters,
where the energy of the singly-occupied state is much lower than the energies of
both the empty and doubly-occupied states. In this case, we use an approach due to
Schrieffer and Wolff (1966), who performed a canonical transformation th at eliminates
the two high-energy states: the empty state |0) and the doubly-occupied state |2).
The idea of the canonical transformation is to transform the Hamiltonian so th at
it is projected onto a subspace with only one electron on the dot, and excursions to
the doubly occupied or empty states occur only virtually. In order to achieve this

THE KONDO EFFECT IN QUANTUM DOTS

goal, the tunneling term should not be present in the transformed Hamiltonian, since
it couples states with different number of electrons on the dot. This cannot be done
exactly, but we can at least do it to linear order in the tunneling term, which then
means th at we seek a canonical transformation

Hs - e's He ,s = ra (HD +

that does not have a linear term in H r- If 5 is chosen to be linear in the tunneling
amplitudes, we can arrange that H t cancels by it requiring th at to linear order in 5
or H t . one should haw

r‘s(Hu+HL„ +HT)c-'s= Ho+HLR+HT+HS,HD+HLR]= HD+HUi, (10.72)
which implies
i[S, H d + H l r] = - H t .

(10.73)

The problem is then to find the operator S th at does this trick, and this is precisely
what was done by Schrieffer and Wolff. They found
S = S+ + S - = (S -) ! + S -

where

(10.75)
Here the first term S * = (<S~)* takes care of the virtual transitions to the doublyoccupied state, while the second term S~ deals with the fluctuations due to transitions
to the empty state. Let us look at the commutator in Eq. (10.73) explicitly, and let
us denote the first term in Eq. (10.75) by

When adding the two and using th a t [S ,H ] = [S ~ ,/f] + [S+, / / ] = [S~, H \ - [ S ~ ,H ] \
we are able to conclude th a t Eq. (10.73) is indeed fulfilled.
We have non* successfully cancelled out the term linear in the tunneling, but of
course all the higher order term s are still there, i.e.,
H s = H d + H i n + i[S, Hr] - - [S ,[S,JJ]] + - [s, [S, [S .W ]]]---,

(10.79)

In general, this cannot be evaluated, bu t the idea is now to keep the next leading
order correction, i.e., the terms to second order in 5 or H p. The Schricffer Wolff
transformation thus deals with the limit where the tunneling is weak, bu t it still allows
for virtual transitions to lowest order in the dot-lead coupling. The Hamiltonian is
then approximated by

(10.80)

and because of Eq. (10.73) this also equals
H s ^ H D + HL R -t-’- l S , H T].

Now we write H r as the sum of a term H p th at corresponds to tunneling onto the

HT = H+ + H f ,

h aw two quantum dot annihilation or creation operators, i.e.,
or c ^ c ^ , and
these terms thus correspond to processes, where the state of th e quantum dot changes
from empty to doubly occupied or vice versa. Since we are interested in deriving an
effective Hamiltonian for the subspace with singly occupancy, we can omit these two
terms all together. The remaining term s (last term in Eq. (10.81)) are,

as well neglect the dependence on

of the a dimensionless param eter x = 1 4- 2£d/t/, which is zero at the particle-hole

The first term is the famous Kondo Hamiltonian. Note th at the spin-spin interaction
is anti-ferromagnetic, which means th a t the energy' is lowered by having anti-parallel
spins. Both term s express scattering on the dot due to virtual scattering in and out
of the dot, with the energies of the virtual processes appearing in the dominators of
Jaa1 and WQa' . While the Kondo Hamiltonian describes the fact th at the spin of lead
electrons can change, if a t the same time the spin of the dot changes, the second term
describes the “potential scattering" contribution, which is independent of the spin
component. The two processes are illustrated in Fig. 10.5. It is im portant to realize
th at th e Kondo Hamiltonian is a simplification of the Anderson model, even though
the latter seems simpler. The reason for this little paradox is th at the dot has four
electron states |0 ),| f ) , | I ), and |2) th at are coupled to the lead electrons, whereas
the Kondo model only involves a single spin and hence two states in the dot on which
the lead electrons may scatter.

F ig . 10.5. Illustration of the scattering processes th at give rise to the Hondo model
and the potential scattering terms in Eq. (10.93). (a) shows the initial state with
an up spin electron in the left lead and the dot occupied by a single spin down
electron. The two possible final states are shown in (b) and (c), where (b) shows a
scattering process that conserves the spin of the localized level, while (c) involves
an exchange of the spins of transm itted electron and the localized electron. See
also Fig. 10.7.
10.5.2 Comparing the Hondo effect in metals and quantum dots
The Hondo model was, as mentioned above, first used in the context of magnetic
impurities in metals, where th e scattering of electrons on the localized spins gives
a contribution to the resistivity. In Chapter 16 we shall see th at the resistivity of
metals is related to the imaginary part of the self-energy, while for the conductance of
a quantum dot we have seen in Section 10.4 th at it is related to the spectral function
of the dot states. Therefore, the scattering, which in the case of metals gives rise to an
enhancement of the resistivity, in the quantum dot case gives rise to an enhancement
of the conductance. To see the relation between scattering on the “impurity” and
the current see also Exercise 10.9. Below, we shall see that scattering in the case
of conductance in fact gives rise to an anomalous contribution to the conductance.
In Section 10.5.5 the essence of the effect is explained qualitatively. Furthermore, in
Section 13.7 the self-energy of the lead electrons is calculated for the Hondo-model.
10.5.3 Hondo-model conductance to second order in //^2>
In this and the following section we calculate the current through a quantum dot up
to third order in the exchange couplings. J QQ#. This will reveal the divergence th at is
the precursor of the Hondo resonance. In the same spirit as our approach to elastic
cotunneling in Section 10.3.3. we consider the amplitude for tunneling an electron horn
left to right, i.e., the final state of the electron system is |/£ B(T„La») =
where |te) denotes the initial state of lead electrons. In addition, also the spin of the
dot spin may have changed in the process, and since neither the final state nor the
initial state is measured, we must sum over all possible initial and final spin states of
the dot spin. These are denoted |tr,) and |<r/), respectively. The rate for transferring

Here, we see th at the occupation
of the intermediate state appears in the scat­
tering amplitude. For ordinary potential scattering, i.e., scattering on an external
potential, we do not expect the occupation factors to enter the amplitude, because it
is essentially a single-particle property. Indeed, below it is shown th at the occupation
factor is only important for the spin-dependent scattering, i.e., for the first term of
in Eq. (10.93), whereas the second term th at corresponds to a simple one-body
scattering on an external potential (see Eq. (1.61)) does not have such a factor.
The amplitude in Eq. (10.103) has two different contributions: one from the en­
ergy conserving scattering, i.e., the delta function p art of 1 /(£j —£ + *J7) and one from

the principal part. The first term corresponds to a classical scattering event where
the intermediate state conserves energy, while the latter is the non-conserving virtual
scattering contribution. The latter term is also the important term for our calculation
because it could lead to a large contribution when
and therefore we concen­
tra te our effort on this term. Now, in order to perform the sum over the intermediate
energy'
, we assume for simplicity the density* of states to be a constant do from a
lower cut-off - D to an upper cut-off + D . For the term in Eq. (10.103) th at docs not

are non-commuting while potential scattering processes commute. More explicitly, we

This expression for the transmission coefficient is one of the main result of o ur dis­
cussion of the Kondo effect in quantum dots. It shows th at there is a peak in the
conductance at low temperatures, because for T -C D the integral in Eq. (10.113)
has a logarithmic divergence, as we will see below. As a side remark, we can now
make a connection to the spectrum function for the Anderson model. The relation­
ship between conductance and the local spectral function was derived in Eq. (10.56).
Here, we have also derived an equation for the conductance for the Anderson model
projected onto the singly occupied space. In this limit, we can therefore identify T(£)
and A(do, £).
Let us now focus on the conductance for the particle-hole symmetric point where
W Lft = 0. Inserting Eq. (10.113) into Eq. (10.112b), we find the perturbative result
for the conductance:

such th at the first term vanishes by antisymmetry of the integrand leaving the last

We have now reached the important conclusion th at the perturbative results for
the conductance diverges logarithmically at low temperatures. Therefore at sufficiently
low tem peratures the perturbation theory stops to be valid, and the system crosses
over to a strong coupling regime, where one has to use other methods. These methods
are more advanced many-particle methods which are outside the scope of this book.
However, we can give a simple estimate of the tem perature a t which the Kondo
resonance starts to dominate transport: when the last term in the parenthesis in
Eq. (10.113) is comparable to the first term . This defines th e so-called Kondo tem­
perature, Tk . Based on this definition, the Kondo tem perature is

repeated (dashed lines).
quantum dot systems, the Kondo tem perature is in the range of a few kelvin. The
subtle and interesting Kondo resonance has been observed in many experiments in
quantum dots and in various scenarios for creating the doubly degenerate groundstate
of the dot. In Fig. 10.6, we show' an illustration of the Kondo effect in a quantum dot.
The Kondo peak is clearly seen as an enhancement in the differential conductance for
odd-number occupations.
10.5.5

Origin o f the logarithmic divergence

In this section, we pin-point the important scattering processes th at lead to the loga­
rithmic divergence. The primary difference between scattering off a spin and scattering
off a static potential is th at the first is a many-body effect, while the latter is a singleparticle effect. In Chapter 7 we saw how, e.g., the conductance of non-interacting
particles is fully determined by the one-particle transmission coefficients and the fact
th at there are other electrons only enters through the distribution function of the ini­
tial state. Therefore, only processes where the occupation factors of the intermediate
states enter are true many-body processes. One such example is the second-order con­
tribution to the transmission amplitude
calculated in Section 10.5.4. In Fig. 10.7,

arithmically diverging contribution to the scattering. It is second order in the
exchange coupling and involves two spin flip processes. In (a) an electron is first
scattered from left to right into an empty state and then in a second interaction
event scattered down to a state near the Fermi energy. In (b) the same final state
is reached through a slightly different path: first an electron-hole pair is created
on the right hand side, then the hole is filled by an electron from the left. In (a)
and (b) the initial state of the localized spin need not be the same, and because
the non-commuting spin flips processes of the localized spin is reversed, the many
possible intermediate add up. This is in stark contrast to a potential scattering
process where the two scattering commute and the many-body contribution in
fact cancels. See Section 10.5.5 for a discussion.
we show the processes that involve a scattering of a spin-up electron from left to
right, via an intermediate state where the spin has been reversed. This can only hap­
pen if the localized spin also flips. The interaction between the two can be written as

The minus sign appears because the lead electrons appear in different order in the
two terms: the first term has a factor

term has a factor

s*nce the down-spin operators should
pair up to give 1 —n and n, respectively, we see th at the order of

The conclusion is now clear: because S + and S ~ do not commute, [5+, S - ] =
S j, the occupation factors for the intermediate state do not cancel. The logarithmic
divergence appears because there is a large number of many-body intermediate states
th at can mediate the process and because the weight of these (assuming a constant
density of states) falls off as l/£ . Thus we have

Combining this with the first order expression for the same process
oc S s, we
conclude that the many-body effect survives and they can potentially give a large
contribution to the scattering coefficient, in agreement with the more detailed calcu­
lation performed in the preceding sections.
10.5.6

The Kondo problem beyond perturbation theory

From the form of the Kondo tem perature in Eq. (10.116), we see th a t the result
is in fact non-perturbative in
. Therefore, we cannot expect to gain much by
continuing our perturbation expansion and. as mentioned above, other methods and
indeed non-perturbative ones, have to be utilized. For the equilibrium properties of the
Kondo or Anderson models, one can use the numerical renormalization group methods
developed by Wilson (1975). This method has since been extended to calculations of
response functions, such as, e.g., the conductance. Alternatively, the Anderson model
can be solved using the Bethe ansatz (Tsvelick and Wiegmann 1983).
An alternative approach to the Kondo problem is the so-called "poor m an's scal­
ing” developed by Anderson (see, e.g., the book by Hewson). The principle behind
the procedure is to relate Kondo Hamiltonians with different exchange couplings and
bandwidth with each other, such that by decreasing the bandwidth but increasing
the exchange coupling the spectrum remains the same. The result of such a scaling
analysis is th at if one sums up the higher terms and keep the most divergent terms,
the logarithmic term in Eq. (10.114a) is the first term of a geometric series which can
be summed up to give

where the Kondo tem perature was given in Eq. (10.116). This result describes the
high tem perature limit T > T p , whereas for low temperatures, one most use other
non-perturhative methods as discussed above. W hat remains true, however, is that
the conductance is a function of a single param eter, namely T/T k , and the Kondo
tem perature therefore appears as a new characteristic energy scale of the problem.
Moreover, it turns out that the conductance at the Kondo resonance, i.e., when the
dot is occupied by one electron, increases all the way to the non-interacting limit.

The conductance of a quantum dot in the case with an odd number of elect rons occu­
pying the dot is sketched in Fig. 10.8 as a function of tem perature. At tem peratures
larger than T > A/fcB, where A is the energy for adding or removing an electron,
the Coulomb blockade is destroyed by therm al fluctuations.39 At lower temperatures,
T k < T < A/fcB, the conductance drops due to Coulomb blockade and the back­
ground conductance is given by either cotunneling or thermally activated tunneling.

S u m m a ry a n d o u tlo o k

The chapter has been devoted to calculating transport properties of mesoscopic sys­
tems using the many-body formalism. Many of the results have been derived starting
from Fermi’s golden rule, which is valid in the weak tunneling limits. In the sequential
tunneling limit the current could be found from a kinetic equation approach which de­
termined the occupations of the quantum states of the dot. The steady state solution
was determined from

where the tunneling rates ^ Q are determined by Fermi’s golden rule. In this ap­
proach the current is always linear in T coefficients and the current is blocked at low
tem peratures and low voltages unless two charge states are generate.
However, to higher orders in the tunneling coupling the electrons can tunnel
through the classically forbidden charge states; a process known as cotunneling or
super-exchange. This process is second order in the T coefficients, and in order to de­
rive an expression for the current we had to resort to the generalized Fermi’s golden
using the T-matrix. The general form of the cotunneling contribution was found to
be /cotun oc V T x,r r / E , where E is the energy of the intermediate forbidden state.
For even stronger tunneling coupling, the Green’s function technique tinned out
to be useful, and we expressed the conductance in terms of the spectral function. For
the Anderson-type model, we found th at

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Unfortunately, it is in general not possible to solve for the Green’s function due to the
combination of interactions in th e dot and the coupling to the continuum of state in
the leads. In this book, we have so far seen two suggestions how to find the spectral
function for an Anderson model. In Section 9.3 we saw th at a mean-field approxima­
tion leads to a Lorentzian form for the spectral function, while in Section 10.4.2 in
was shown that a better approximation leads to a two-peak structure of the spectral
function. Only when the tunneling-broadened energy T is much larger than the in­
teraction energy U is the mean-field result recovered. The two-peak structure of the
spectral function reflects the broadening of the Coulomb blockade, obtained in the
rate equation approach, due to finite tunneling life time.
For even stronger tunneling coupling and a t low tem perature yet another inter­
esting effect sets in, namely the Kondo effect. In this regime, the spectral function
develops a peak at the Fermi energy which corresponds to the resonant spin-flip scat­
tering and the conductance therefore increases again.
We have seen, how the different techniques in many-body theory had to be used
in order to understand the current-voltage characteristic of mesoscopic systems. In
the following chapters of this book, we will expand on the tools available, e.g., the
Feynman diagram technique which is explored in Chapters 12 and 13. Finally, we
return to the physics of mesoscopic systems in Chapter 16, where we discuss the
effects of disorder, and in Chapter 19 where electron correlations in one-dimension
are discussed.

IMAGINARY-TIME GREEN’S FUNCTIONS
We have seen that physical observables often have the form of Green's functions,
or th at they can be derived in a simple way from the Green's functions. In all the
situations we have so far studied the physical observables have been related to the
retarded Green’s functions. In analogy with Eqs. (8.28) and (8.29), a more general
class of functions containing the Green's functions can be defined as

When A and B are single-particle annihilation and creation operators, it is the single
particle Green’s function defined in Eq. (8.28), from which one could derive the density
of states. When A and B are two-particle operators, e.g., the density or current
operators, C n has the form of a retarded correlation function th at was shown to give
the linear response results of Chapter 6. In Eq. (11.1) boson operators mean either
single-particle operators like b or
or an even number of fermion operators such as
c*c appearing in, e.g., the density operator p. The im portant feature th at distinguishes
the boson case from the fermion case is the sign change obtained upon interchange.
In this chapter, we introduce a mathematical method to work out the retarded
Green’s functions. For technical reasons it is convenient to use a mapping to a more
general Green's function, where the time and frequency arguments are imaginary
quantities. This has no real physical meaning, and is only a clever mathematical
trick, which we need to learn. This is much like treating electrical circuit theory with
complex numbers even though all currents and voltages are real. The present chapter
concentrates on the mathematical details o f the technique, while applications are left
for later. The imaginary tim e formalism is particularly useful when we want to perform
perturbation theory, and this will eventually lead us to the Feynman diagrams.
Let us for example look at the definition of the following correlation function:
=

(11.2 )

from which we can find the retarded function as C R = iO(t —t')(CAB T C b a )- By
definition we have
" A (()fl((')].

(11.3)

Suppose the Hamiltonian is H = H o + V , where V is the perturbation. Then we saw
in Chapter 5 th at the interaction picture provides a systematic way of expanding in
powers of V. We could try to utilize this and write C a b as
CAB(t,t') = - | t t [e* HU (0 ,t)A {t)(l(t,l')R (* ')fr(t',0)] ■

(11.4)

IMAGINARY-TIME GREEN S FUNCTIONS

In Eq. (5.18) wc saw also how a single U operator could be expanded as a time-ordered
exponential. This would in Eq. (11.4) result in three time-ordered exponentials, which
could be collected into a single time-ordered exponential. But the trouble arises for
the density matrix e * H, which should also be expanded in powers of the interaction.
To make a long story short: this is a mess, and a new idea is therefore needed. One
solution to this problem is to use imaginary times instead of real times, but bear in
mind that this is just a mathematical trick without physical contents.
To employ imaginary time is not as far fetched as it might look, because both
the density operator p = e * Hf Z from Eq. (1.116) and the time-evolution operator
U (t) = e~iHt are exponential functions of th e Hamiltonian.40 They therefore satisfy
similar differential equations: U satisfies the Schrodinger equation. idtU = H U , while
p is the solution to Q p = —H p, known as the Bloch equation. In order to treat both
U and p in one go, the tim e argument is replaced by an imaginary quantity t -> —i t ,
where r is real and has the dimension time. In the end this means th at both U and
p can be treated in just one expansion in powers of V . Furthermore, we will see that
there is a well-defined method to obtain the physically relevant quantity, i.e., to go
back to physical real times from the imaginary-time function.
As for real time we can define an imaginary-time Heisenberg picture by substitut­
ing it by r . We define

A(t)= erIiA e~TH, r a Greek letter.

(11.5)

In this notation, the imaginary-time definitions are used when the time argument is
a Greek letter . The usual definition is used w'hen the times are w ritten with roman
letters,
A (t) = euHA e~ltH, t a Roman letter.
(11-6)
Similar to the interaction picture defined for real times, we can define the inter­
action picture for imaginary times as
A ( t ) = eTjIoA e - rI/o.

(11.7)

Letting H = H0 + V , the relation between the Heisenberg and the interaction picture
in imaginary time follows the arguments in Chapter 5. If we consider a product of
operators A ( t ) B ( t ') and write it in terms of the corresponding operators in the
interaction representation, we get
=

0 (0 , t )A(t )U( t ,7 ' ) B ( / ) ( J ( t ' , 0 ) ,

(11.8)

where, like in Eq. (5.12), the timocvohrtion operator 0 in the interaction picture is
tf(T,T') = er " » e - ( '- r ’) " p- r '« 0 !

(11.9)

from which it follows directly th at

(11.10)
An explicit expression for U
( t, t'

Eq. (5.18). First we differentiate Eq. (11.9) with respect to r and find
d r 0 ( T y ) = e T" « ( f f 0 -

This is analogous to Eq. (5.13) and the boundary condition,

The time ordering is again the same as defined in Section 5.3, i.e., the operators are

(11.13)

Below, we use this property together with the properties of the time-ordering to write
expectation values in a very compact and useful way.
Consider the time-ordered expectation value of the pair of operators in Eq. (11.8)

(TtA{t)B{t))= - T r p " T ,[ / l( r ) S ( r ') ] } .
(11.14)
and let us first study the caseS > r > t
*>0. In this case, the operators A(t)and
B(t)are ordered as in Eq. (11.8). Inserting E<p. (11.8) and (11.13). we have

[e* "°m , Q)t/(0, r)A{T)U(T.

where Eq. (11.10) has been used to combine U
$,0) and f/(0, r). Now the timeordering is reintroduced. First we observe th at when writing U
(r, ') as in Eq. (11.12)
only interactions V

This was derived for the case r > t ', and in the opposite case r < T >the same line of
arguments are used. First write

where the sign cliange was reabsorbed into time-ordering operator. We now see that
Eq. (11.16) and Eq. (11.18) are identical and therefore we have the result for both
t > t " and t < r '.
Our final result for the expectation value in Eq. (11.14) is

The result in Eq. (11.19) demonstrates th at the trick of using imaginary time
indeed allows for a systematic expansion of the complicated looking expression in
Eq. (11.4). However, before we can see the usefulness fully, we need to relate the
correlation functions written in imaginary' time and the correlation function with
real-time arguments.

Definitions of M atsubara G reen’s functions

The imaginary-time Green's functions, also called M atsubara Green's functions, are
defined in the following way
CJ fl( r , r ') ^ - { r . [ A ( r ) f l ( / ) ] ) ,

(11.20)

where the time-ordering symbol in imaginary' tim e has been introduced. It means that
operators are ordered according to history and ju st like the time-ordering operator
seen in Chapter 5 with the later “times” to the left,

r T[A (r)fl(r')]= « (r - / ) A ( r ) B M ± f l ( r ’ - r ) f l( r ') A ( r ) ,

The next question is: W hat values can r have? FYom the definition in Eq. (11.20)
three things arc clear. First, Ca b (t , t ') is a function of the time difference only, i.e.,

Finally, we remark th at the boundaries of the integral f 0 d r in Eq. (11.28) leads
to a minor ambiguity of how to treat the boundary t = 0, e.g., if C a b (t ) includes a
delta function 6(t ). A consistent choice is always to move the time argument into the
interior of the interval [0)3 ], e.g., replace £ (r) by 6(r — 0+ ).

We shall now see why the M atsubara Green’s functions have been introduced at all.
In the frequency domain they are in fact the same analytic function as the usual
real times G reen's functions. In other words, there exists an analytic function Ca b (*) i
where z is a complex frequency argument in the upper half plane, th at equals Cafl(*Hi)
on the imaginary axis and C%B(u ) on the real axis. This means th at once we have
one of the two, the other one follows by analytic continuation. Since it hi in many
cases much easier to compute the M atsubara function C ^a («•>„), this is a powerful
method for finding the corresponding retarded function. Indeed we Bhall now show
th at the appropriate analytic continuation is C%B (w) = Ca b (
-> u + iij), where rj
is a positive infinitesimal.
The relation between the two functions Ca b and C%B is proven by use of the
Lehmann representation. In Section 8.3.3 we calculated the retarded single-particle

Green's function, and the result (8.48) can be carried over for fermions. In the general

Here, it is important to note th at it is assumed th at the grand-canonical ensemble
is Iteing used, because the complete set of states includes states with any numl>er of
particles. Therefore the connection between imaginary time functions and retarded
real-time functions derived below is only valid in this ensemble.
The M atsuhara function is calculated in a similar way. For r > 0, we have

This function is analytic in the upper (or lower) half plane, but has a series of poles

functions coincide in an infinite set of points then they are fully identical functions
within the entire domain, where at least one of them is an analytic function, and
furthermore, there is only one such common function. This means th at if we know
CAB (iu n) we can find C%B(w) by analytic continuation:

not obvious how to perform the continuation. For example look at the definition in
Eq. (11.28). If we naively insert iu)n
oj + irj before doing the integral, the answer
is completely different and of course wrong. Later we shall see examples of how to
perform the analytic continuation correctly.
To summarize: Using the Lehmann representation we have shown th at there exists
a function CAg{z) which is analytic for z not purely real, and which coincides with
the M atsuhara function, i.e., C a b ( z — «*>n) = C A B ( iu } n ) . Approaching the real axis
from positive imaginary values, this function is identical to the retarded function, i.e,,
CAg (z = w + i0+) = C%B(u). However, it is not a simple task to determine CAg(z)
unless it has been reduced to a rational function as in Eq. (11.31), where it is evident
th at the replacement in (11.33) iun
z -» u + *ij gives the right analytic function.
This is illustrated in Fig. 11.1.
11.2.1

Advanced functions

The function CAg (z) is analytic for all ; away from the real axis. Therefore instead
of the continuation in the upper half plane, we could do the same thing in the lower
half plane iuin —* z

C a B ( w ) — C A B ( i i ^ n —> w — « l ) .

(11.34)

The advanced Green’s function is in the tim e domain defined as
(11.35)
The term “advanced” means th at it gives the state of the system a t previous times
based on the state of system a t present times. The retarded one, as was explained in
Chapter 8, gives the present state of the system as it has evolved from the state at
previous times, i.e., the effect of retardation.

When working with M atsubara Green’s functions, we will often encounter sums over

or sums with products of Green’s functions. The imaginary time formalism has been
introduced. t>ccause it will be used to perform perturbation expansions, and therefore
the types of sums that we will encounter, are often products of such free Green’s
functions, e.g..
T>0.

FlC. 11.3. The contour C consisting of two parts, Ci and C2. used to perform the
M atsuhara sum for a function with known branch cuts. Such a function is analytic
in the entire complex plane except on the branch cuts. The contribution from the
circular parts of the contour goes to zero as |z| -> 0 0 , and hence only the paths
parallel to the cut (here the real axis) contribute.

Summations over functions with known branch cuts

The second type of sums we will meet are of the form in Eq. (11.45). If it is the full
Green's function, including for example the influence of interaction, we do not know
the poles of the Green’s function, bu t we do know' th at it is analytic for z not on the
real axis. This general property of the Green’s function was shown in Section 11.2.
In general, consider the sum

(11.59)

where it is known th at g(z) is analytic in the entire complex plane except on the
real axis. A contour, which includes all points z = ik„ and no singularities of g. is
therefore C = C1 +C 2 depicted in Fig. 11.3. As in the example studied in the previous
section (see Eq. (11.55)), the part where |z| —» 0 0 does not contribute to the integral,
and we are left with the parts of the contour running parallel to the real axis. They
are shifted by an inflnitesimal amount q away from the real axis on either side

The equation of motion technique, used in Chapter 9 to find various Green’s functions,
can also be used for the M atsubara functions. In the imaginary time formalism, the
time derivative of an operator is
BrA(r) = aT(ertt A e - rH) ^ er B [H}A ]e -r‘' = [ff, 4 |( r) .

(11.63)

= «(r - rf)(A B - ( ± )B A ) + (Tr {IH ,A](r)B(T/ ) } ) ,
where as usual the minus sign in ± is for fermion operators, whereas the plus sign
should be used for boson operators.
For the single-particle Green’s functions defined in Eqs. (11.36), we then obtain
for both fermion and boson Green's functions

For example, for a diagonal Hamiltonian those given in Eqs. (11.40) and (11.41).
11.6 W ic k ’s th e o re m
We end this rather technical part by proving an extremely useful theorem, which we
will need later when doing perturbation theory', and which is used in the example
ending this chapter. The theorem — the celebrated Wick’s theorem — states that
for non-interacting particles, i.e., when the Hamiltonian is quadratic, higher-order
Green's function involving more than one particle can be factorized into products of
single-particle Green’s functions.
Consider an n-particle Green’s function defined as

(11.68)

The average is taken with respect to a non-interacting Hamiltonian Ho, such as the
one of Eq. (11.65), and this is indicated by the subscript 0. The tim e evolution is also
with respect to Ho. and it is given by
c(r) = € t""c <Tt "“.

(11.69)

The expression in (11.68) is indeed quite complicated to look at, if we write out
all the passible orderings and the conditions for th at particular ordering. For example
if n = 2, there are 4 time arguments, which can be ordered in 4! different ways.
Let us simplify the writing by defining one operator symbol for both creation and
annihilation operators

and furthermore define the permutations of the 2n operators as
P ( d , M - - ‘‘2 n ( ^ n ) ) = d Pi(aPl) - - - d PiJ a pJ ,

(11.71)

where Pj denotes the j t h variable in the perm utation P, e.g., define the list (a, 6, c)
and the perm utation (c ,a ,b ) then P = (3,1,2). Which perm utation is the correct one

W IC K ’S T HEOREM

of course depends on how the time arguments in (11.68) are really ordered. Therefore
if we sum over all perm utations (the set of all permutations of N elements is denoted
Sjv) and include the corresponding conditions, we can rewrite
as

(11.72)

where the factor (±1 )P takes into account th at for fermions (minus sign) it casts a
sign change every tim e a pair of operators are commuted.
The easiest way to prove Wick's theorem is through th e equation of motion for
the n-particle Green's function. Thus we differentiate Q„n) with respect to one of the
time arguments, r j , . . . , r n . This gives two kinds of contributions: the terms coming
from the derivative of the theta functions and one term from the derivative of the
expectation value itself. For example for 71, the last one giveB

which is similar to the derivation th at lead to Eqs. (11.66) and (11.67), so therefore
we have
(11-74)
where Q ^1 means th at it works on the coordinates 1^,7*. On the right-hand side, the
derivative only acts on the th eta functions in Eq. (11.72).
Take now for example the case when 7* is next to Tj. There are two such terms in
(11.72), corresponding to t* being either smaller or larger than Tj, and they will have
different order of the perm utation. In this case, (/<n) has the structure

which therefore does not contribute. The number of creation and annihilation opera­
tors has thus both been reduced by one, and it leaves a Green’s function which is no
longer an n-particle Green's function bu t an (n —1)-Green’s function. In fact, we saw
a special case of this in Eq. (11.66) where a one-particle Green’s function was reduced
to a zero-particle Green’s function, i.e., a constant. However, we have not determined
the sign of the new (n —1)-Green’s function, which we will denote by (—l)x. The sign
will (for fermions) depend on the t '- in question. Including this undetermined sign,
our equation of motion (11.74) now looks like

(11.80b)

Now Eq. (11.79) can be integrated, and because Q ^ has the same boundary
conditions as G0, the solution is the same as for the differential equation in Eq. (11.66),
namely the single-particle Green’s function. As a result

By recalling the definition of determinants and permanents, Eqs. (1.24) and (1.25),

In Section 8.5 we calculated the polarizability of non-interacting free electrons. In
order to illustrate the working principle of the imaginary time formalism, we do it
again here.
The starting point is the physical quantity which is needed: the frequency-dependent
retarded charge charge correlation function y ft(q,uj). which follows from the corre­
sponding M atsuhara function by
* 'i(q .“ ) = x(q.>9n - t w + ilj).

(11.85)

Note th at the time dependence of th e c-operators is given by the full Hamiltonian.
However, because we are considering a noninteracting, free electron gas, the full Hamil­
tonian and the unperturbed Hamiltonian are the same. In order to be consistent with
the notation in this chapter, we write the time-dependent operators with a hat.
By Wick's theorem, this is given by a product of single-particle Green’s func­
tions with all possible pairings and with the sign given by the number of times we
interchange two fermion operators, i.e.,
x o (q .r)

where we consider only q ^ 0 and use that £ 0(k. k ') oc 6^ ^ .
The next step is to calculate the frequency-dependent function, which amounts to
the Fourier transform of the sum of products in (11.86). The Fourier transformation of
a product in the tim e domain is a convolution in the frequency domain. Because one
function has argument r w'hile the other has argument —r , the internal frequencies
in the two Fourier transforms come with the same sign,

When performing calculations of physical quantities at finite tem peratures, it turns
out th at the easiest way to find the “real time” , introduced in Chapter 8, is often
to go via the imaginary-time formalism. This formalism has been introduced in this
chapter, and in the following chapters on Feynman diagrams it is a necessary tool.
There, we will see, why it is more natural to use the imaginary time Green’s function,
also called M atsubara Green’s function. The reason is that the time evolution operator
and the Boltzmann weight factor can be treated on an equal footing and one single
perturbation expansion suffices. In the real time formalism there is no simple way of
doing this.
We have also derived some very useful relations concerning sums over M atsubara
frequencies. The main points to remember are the following:

FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS AND EXTERNAL POTENTIALS
From the previous diapters on linear response theory and Green's functions, it is dear
th at complete calculations of thermal averages of time-dependent phenomena in quan­
tum field theory are a rather formidable task. Even the basic imaginary time-evolution
operator 0 ( t ) itself is an infinite series to all orders in the interaction V (r ,r ) . One
simply faces the problem of getting lost in the myriads of integrals, and not being able
to m aintain a good physical intuition of which terms are important. In 1948 Feynman
solved this problem as part of his seminal work on quantum electrodynamics by in­
venting the ingenious diagrams th at today bear his name. The Feynman diagrams are
both an exact mathematical representation of perturbation theory to infinite order
and a powerful pictorial method th at elucidate the physical content of the compli­
cated expressions. In this chapter, we introduce the Feynman diagrams for the case
of non-interacting particles in an external potential. Our main example of their use
will be the analysis of electron-impurity scattering in disordered metals.

Consider a time-independent Hamiltonian H in the space representation describing
non-interacting fermions in an external spin-diagonal single-particle potential Vv (r),

H=Ho+V=Y.J'k *t(r)Ho(r)*„M+ £ / * * i(r )V „ (r )* 1F(r).

(12.1)

As usual, we assume that the unperturbed system described by the time-independent
Hamiltonian H0 is solvable, and th at we know the corresponding eigenstates |i/) and
Green's functions
In the following, it will prove helpful to introduce the short-hand
notation
( 12. 2 )

for points and integrals in space-time.
We want to study the full Green's function, Q(b,a) = —(Tt 4*(6)^t (a)), governed
by H . and the bare one, ff°(b,a) = - { T r 4,(6)wt (a))„, governed hy H0. We note th at
since no particle-particle interaction is present in Eq. (12.1), both the full Hamiltonian
H and the bare H0 have the simple form of Eq. (11.65), and the equations of motion
for the two Green’s functions have the same form as Eq. (11.66),
6 ° ( M ) = S (b -a ) » [-9 „ -R (6 )+ Y (!,)] S ° ( M ) = 4 ( l- tt) , (12.3a)

NON-INTERACTING PARTICLES IN EXTERNAL POTENTIALS

where we have also given the forma] solution erf Q, which is helpful in acquiring the
actual solution for Q. Substituting S(b - a) in Eq. (12.3b) by the expression from
Eq. (12.3a) yields,

I - a „ - W(4)1 ff(M ) = [- « „ - m

(12.4)

= [-fl„ -ff(6)]0°(6,£i) + J d l6 (b -l )V ( t)g ° (l, a ).
Acting from the left with [—
Dyson equation,

iT(6)]- 1 gives an integral equation for Q, the so-called

0(6, a ) = 0 ° (6, a) + j il S ( h A ) V { V ) Q " { \. a ) ,

(12.5)

where we have used the second expression in Eq. (12.3b) to introduce Q in the in­
tegrand. By iteratively inserting Q itself in the integrand on the left-hand side, we
obtain the infinite perturbation series

0(5, a) = 0"(6, a) + jdX 0°(6,1) K(l) 0°(1, a)

The solutions Eqs. (12.5) and (12.6) for Q are easy to interpret. The propagator Q of a
fermion in an external potential is given as the sum of all possible processes involving
unperturbed propagation, described by Q°, intersected by any number of scattering
events V . So in this simple case there is really no need for further elucidation, but we
will anyway proceed by introducing the corresponding Feynman diagrams.
The first step is to define the basic graphical vocabulary, i.e., to define the pictograms representing the basic quantities Q, Q°. and V of the problem. This vocabu­
lary is known as the Feynman rules.

C (M ) =

(12.7)

Note how the fermion lines point from the points of creation, e.g., 4** (a), to the points
of annihilation, e.g., 'l'(fe). Using the Feynman rules, th e infinite perturbation series
Eq. (12.6) becomes

In this form we clearly see how the full propagator from a to 6 is the sum over all
possible ways to connect a and b w ith bare propagators via any number of scattering
events. We can also perform calculations by manipulating the diagrams. Let us for
example derive an integral form equivalent to Eq. (12.5) from Eq. (12.8),

(12.10)

The former integral equation (12.5) for Q is obtained by pulling out the bottom
part V'(n) £ ° (n ,a ) of every diagram on the right-hand side of Eq. (12.8). thereby
exchanging the arrow and the double arrow in the last diagram of Eq. (12.9).
This is a first demonstration of the compactness of the Feynman diagram tech­
nique. and how visual clarity is obtained without loss of mathematical rigor.

12.2

Elastic scattering and M atsubara frequencies

When a fermion system interacts w ith a static external potential, no energy is trans­
ferred between the two systems, a situation referred to as elastic scattering. The lack
of energy transfer in elastic scattering is naturally reflected in a particularly simple
form of the single-particle Green's function (7(ifc„) in M atsubara frequency space. In
the following, the spin index a is left out since the same answer is obtained for the
two spin directions.
First, we note th at since the Hamiltonian H in Eq. (12.1) is tim e independent for
static potentials, we know from Eq. (11.22) th a t £ ? (rr,rV ) depends only on the time

difference t - t '. According to Eqs. (11.25b) and (11.28) it can therefore be expressed
in terms of a Fourier transform with just one fermionic M atsubara frequency ikn,
C ( r r ,r V ) = - J ^ f f ( r , r

(? (r,r';ik n) = J d (r - t ,)G ( tt,r V ) e<A»(r“ T,).
The Fourier transform of the time convolution j d r \
—Ti )VQ( ti —t„ ) appearing
in the integral equation of Q. is the product G°(ikn)VG(ik„). The elastic scattering,
i.e., the time-independent V . cannot change the frequencies of the propagators. In
M atsubara frequency space the Dyson equation Eq. (12.10) takes the form
S(r„, r„; i k j = ff°(rb, r a;ikn ) t J dr, S " (r6)r ,;« :„ ) V (l) S ( r „ r 0| ikn).

As seen previously, the expressions are simplified by transforming from the |r)-basis
to the basis \v) which diagonalizes H0. We define the transformed Green’s function
in this basis as,
0„„/ = J d r d r 1 (i/|r)fi?(r,r')(r'|i/)

o

^(r,r') = J ^ ( r |i/) ^ ( i/'|r ') .

(12.13)

In a similar way, we define the |i/)-transform of V (r) as Vvv>= f d r (i'|r)V, (r)(r|l/).
In the |j/, ilfcn) representation, the equation of motion Eq. (12.3b) for Q is a matrix
equation,

where £ 0 is a diagonal m atrix with th e eigenenergies

We have thus reduced the problem of finding the full Green’s function to a matrix
inversion problem. We note in particular th at in accordance with Eq. (11.43) the hare
propagator {/° has the simple diagonal form

We can utilize this to rewrite the integral equation Eq. (12.12) as a simple matrix

G (iv'*;i*fI) =

vVbVcG(t/ei/a;ikn ).

(12.16)

We can also formulate Feynman rules in ( 1/, ifcn)-space. We note th at § 0 is diagonal
in 1/, while V is a general m atrix. To obtain the sum of all possible quantum processes
one must sum over all m atrix indices different from the externally given ua and i/j.

An im portant example of elastic scattering by external potentials is the case of random
impurities in a disordered metal. One well-controlled experimental realization of this
is provided by a perfect metal Cu lattice with Mg11 ions substituting a small number
of randomly chosen Cu1 ions. The valence of the impurity ions is one higher than
the host ions, and as a first approximation an impurity ion at site
gives rise to
a simple screened monocharge Coulomb potential Uj(r) = —(e^ /lr —P^-1)
The screening is due to the electrons in the system trying to neutralize the impurity
charge, and as a result the range of the potential is finite, given by the so-called
screening length a. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
In Fig. 12.1(a) a number of randomly positioned impurities in an otherwise perfect
metal lattice is shown. The presence of the impurities can be detected by measuring
the (longitudinal) resistivity pxx of the metal as a function of tem perature. At high
tem perature, the resistivity is mainly due to electron-phonon scattering, and since the
vibrational energy h u ( n + 1) in thermal equilibrium is proportional to k ^ T , the num­
ber n of phonons, and hence the electron-phonon scattering rate, is also proportional
to T (see e.g., Exercise 3.2). At lower tem perature the phonon degrees of freedom
begin to freeze out, and the phase space available for scattering also shrinks, and
consequently the resistivity becomes proportional to some power a of T . Finally, at
the lowest temperatures, typically a few kelvin, only the electron-impurity scattering
is left preventing the Bloch electrons in moving unhindered through the crystal. As a
result, the resistivity levels off at some value po, the so-called residual resistivity. The
tem perature behavior of the resistivity is depicted in Fig. 12.1(b).
We postpone the calculation of the resistivity, and in this section ju st concen­
trate on studying the electron M atsubara Green’s function Q for electrons moving in
such a disordered metal. We use the plane wave states |k<r) from the effective mass
approximation Eq. (2.16) as the unperturbed basis |u).
Now consider iVimp identical impurities situated at the randomly distributed but
fixed positions P j . The elastic scattering potential V (r) then acquires the form

This nth-order contribution can be interpreted as the sum over all processes involving

hope to solve this problem exactly. Not only is it for all practical purposes impossible
to know where all the impurities in a given metallic sample de facto are situated, but
even if we did, no simple solution for the Green’s function could be found. However,
if w'e are satisfied with the answer to the less-ambitious and more practical question
of what is the average behavior, then we shall soon find an answer. To this end we
reformulate Dyson’s equation in k space since according to Eq. (12.15) (?{j of the

due to phase coherent scattering against randomly positioned impurities. Below
is indicated th a t the phase coherence length

due to the smallness of l^, at this tem perature. The sample now contains a large
number of independent but phase-coherent subsystems of size
as illustrated
below the plot. As a result a substantial self-averaging occurs, which suppresses
the quantum fluctuations.
each individual diffraction pattern will of course change drastically due to the sensi­
tivity of the scattering phases of the wavefimetions. Significant quantum fluctuations
must therefore occur in any observable at sufficiently low temperatures.
Using modern nanotechnology to fabricate small (but still macroscopic) samples,
and standard cryogenic equipment to cool down these samples to ultralow temper­
atures. one can in fact obtain an experimental situation, where the electrons can
traverse the sample without loosing their quantum-mechanical phase coherence. In
Fig. 12.2(a) is shown the conductance trace of a GaAs nano-device, such as the one
shown in Fig. 2.10, a t 0.31 K as a function of the electron density. This density can he
controlled by applying a gate voltage Vg on an external electrode. The conductance
G is seen to fluctuate strongly for minute changes of Vg. These fluctuations tu rn out
to be perfectly reproducible as Vg is swept up and down several times.
As the tem perature of a given sample is raised, the amount of electron-electron
and electron-phonon scattering increases because of an increased phase space for scat­
tering and an increased number of phonons. The quantum mechanical phase of each
individual electron is changed by a small random amount at each inelastic scattering

event, and as a result the coherence length lv for the electrons diminishes. At suffi­
ciently high tem perature (e.g., 4.1 K)
is much smaller than the size of the device,
and we can think of the device as being composed as a number of phase-independent
small phase-coherent subsystems. Therefore, when one measures an observable the
result is in fact an incoherent average of all these subsystems. Note th at this average
is imposed by the physical properties of the system itself, and this effective averaging
is consequently denoted self-averaging. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 12.2(b) where
the conductance trace a t 4.1 K is seen to be much smoother than the one at 0.31 K,
and where the many small phase-coherent subsystems of the sample are indicated
below the experimental graph.
For very large (mm-sized) macroscopic samples. lv is much smaller than the sample
size a t all experimental realizable tem peratures (T > 10 mK for electron gases in m et­
als and semiconductors), and we are in the impurity self-averaging case. M athemati­
cally, the impurity average is performed by summing over all the phase-independent
coherent subsystems and dividing by their number N aya. But due to the random dis­
tribution of the impurities, this average is the same as an average over the impurity
position within a single subsystem, as can be seen from Fig. 12.2. However, even on
the rather small length scale I# the system is already homogeneous, and one can as
well perform the position average over the entire volume of the sample. Thus in the
following, we average over all possible uncorrelated positions
of the JVimp impurities
for the entire system,

(12.32)

Here, we have anticipated th a t the impurity-averaged Green’s function is diagonal in k
due to the restoring of translation invariance upon average. Some care must be taken
regarding the average over the impurity positions P j. Any nth-order contribution to
Gk contains n scattering events, but they need not be on n different scatterers. In
fact, the number of scatterers involved could be any number between 1 and n. We
must therefore carefully sort out all possible ways to scatter on p different impurities.
As mentioned in Eq. (12.20), we work in the limit of small impurity densities
n jmp. For a given fixed number n of scattering events the most im portant contri­
bution therefore comes from processes involving ju st one impurity. Then, down by
the small factor n imp/ n el, follow processes involving two impurities, etc. We note
th at in Eq. (12.29) the only reference to the impurity positions is the exponential
exp[i(q! • P + q 2 •P J3 H------1-qn • P Jn)], with the scattering vectors q, = kf —ki_1.
The sum in Eq. (12.29) over impurity positions in this exponential is now ordered
according to how many impurities are involved,

By definition all the scattering vectors in one particular subset Q t arc connected to
the same impurity P hi. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (12.33) thus
corresponds to all scattering being on the same impurity, the second term th at only
two impurities are involved et cetera. Note th at, strictly speaking, two different impu­
rities cannot occupy the same position. Nevertheless, in Eq. (12.33) we let the h-sums
run unrestricted. This introduces a small error of the order 1/N lmp for the important
terms in the low impurity density limit involving only a few Impurities.42
Since all the p positions P A now are manifestly different we can perform the
impurity average indicated in Eq. (12.32) over each exponential factor independently.
The detailed calculation is straightforward but somewhat cumbersome; the result may
perhaps be easier to understand th an the derivation. As depicted in Eq. (12.38), the
impurity-averaged Green’s function is a sum over scattering processes on the positionaveraged impurities. Since translation invariance is restored by the averaging, the sum
of all scattering momenta on the same impurity must be zero, cf. Fig. 12.3. But let
us see how these conclusions are reached.
The impurity average indicated in Eq. (12.32) over each independent exponen­
tial factor results in some Kronecker delta’s, meaning th at all scattering vectors q
connected to the same impurity must add up to zero.

SELF-ENERGY FOR IMPURITY SCATTERED ELECTRONS

From this solution we immediately learn th at Ek enters {(?k)imp as an additive cor­
rection to the original unperturbed energy. £k -> £k + Ek, hence the name self-energy.
The problem of finding {Gk)-Imp is thus reduced to a calculation of Ek . In the following
we go through various approximations for Ek .
12.5.1

Lowest-order approximation

One marvellous feature of the self-energy E k is th a t even if it is approximated by
a finite number of diagrams, the Dyson equation (12.40) actually ensures th at some
diagrams of all orders are included in the perturbation series for (£k)lmp- This allows
for essential changes in ({7k)lnip, notably one can move the poles of (£k)imp and hence
change the excitation energies. This would not be possible if only a finite number of
diagrams were used in the expansion of ( f t c ) ^ itself.
Bearing in mind the inequalities in Eqs. (12.20) and (12.21), the lowcst-ordcr
approximation EfcOA to Ek is obtained by including only the diagram with the fewest
number of impurity stars and scattering lines,

nimpu0= ntm

l.e., a constant, which upon insertion into Dyson’s equation (12.41) yields

s£OA(«„) = ________ 1________

(12.43)

* * n - ( 4 + n tapUo )‘

But this just reveals a simple constant shift of all the energy levels with the amount
n lmpu0. This shift constitutes a redefinition of the origin of the energy axis with no
dynamical consequences. In the following, it is absorbed into the definition of the
chemical potential and will therefore not appear in the equations.
12.5.2

First-order B om approximation

The simplest non-trivial low-order approximation to the self-energy is the so-called
first-order Bom approximation given by the “wigwam"-diagram
A« >

(12.44)

where we have used that u_k = uk since u (r) is real. We shall see shortly that
EkBA = R eE kBA + t'Im EkBA moves the poles of (Qk)imp =
« ■ away from the real
axis. i.e., the propagator acquires a finite lifetime. By Eq. (12.40) we see th at (?kBA
is the sum of propagations with any number of sequential wigwam-diagrams:

than 70 mV over the coherence length lv < 10-5 m (the typical size we are looking

we are only interested in £ kBA(ifcn ) for

(12.46)

Here, we have also anticipated th at at the end of the calculation, as sketched in
Fig. 11.1, we need to perform an analytical continuation down to the real axis, either
from the upper half-plane, where Arn > 0, as ikn -» u + irj, or from the lower half-plane,
where kn < 0, as ikn -> w — irj.
Furthermore, as we shall study in great detail later, the electron gas redistributes
itself to screen out the external charges from the impurities, and as a result uk_k,
varies in a smooth and gentle way for 0 < |k - k'l < 2fcF.

In conclusion, the impurity-averaged first Born approximation has resulted in a

temporal and spatial exponential decay of the retarded Green’s function. This is in­

the broadening of the spectral function. The characteristic sharp 4-function for free

means th at a particle with momentum k can have an energy w th at differs from

This calculation of self-averaged impurity scattering constitutes a first and very
important example of what can happen in a many-particle system. Note in particular
the important role played by the self-energy, and the fact th at it can have a non­
zero imaginary part. The results are obtained in the first-order Born approximation,
where the self-energy is approximated by a single diagram. But what happens if we
take more diagrams into account? The surprising answer is th at in the low impurity
density limit. nlrop < nc| no qualitative difference arises by taking more diagrams
into account. Only at higher impurity densities where scattering events from different
impurities begin to interfere new physical effects, such as weak localization, appear.
Let us see how this conclusion is reached.

tion, w hkh is exact to lowest order in niinp. It is defined bv the following self-energy

sign of the imaginary part. But this requirement is fulfilled by taking Im ESCBA (ikn) oc

between the full Born and the self-consistent Bom approximation is in the case of
strong scattering, where the limiting 6-function in Eq. (12.60) may acquire a small
renormalization. When all the dust has settled, we have the simple result for the

where the scattering lines cross, the Feynman rules dictate one further constraint,
namely |k + k , - k 2| «* kF. Thus only one of the two internal momenta are free to
be anywhere on the Fermi shell, the other is bound to the intersection between two

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

225

The theory presented here provides in combination with the Kubo Formalism the
foundation for a microscopic quantum theory of resistivity. The technique can be
extended to the study of quantum effects like weak localization (see Section 16.5) and
universal conductance fluctuations (see Fig. 12.2). These more subtle quantum effects
are fundamental parts of the modern research field known as mesoscopic physics.
They can be explained within the theoretical framework presented here, by taking
higher-order correlations into account. For example is weak localization explained
by treating crossed diagrams like the one in Fig. 12.6(b), which was neglected in
calculation presented in this chapter.

FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS AND PAIR INTERACTIONS
It is in the case of interacting particles and fields th at the power of quantum field
theory and Feynman diagrams really comes into play. In this chapter, we develop
the Feynman diagram technique for a system of fermions with pair interactions. The
primary example we will work with is a gas of fermions interacting through Coulomb
interactions, but the technique is derived in a more general framework. In general,
the Hamiltonian has two parts H = H 0 + W .
One part represents the single particle energy, i.e., the kinetic energy and the
single particle potential. In the real-space basis it reads

a J
where as usual h0(r) is the single-particle (first quantization) Hamiltonian. Using a
different basin ns in Eq. (1.69), the single-particle part of the Hamiltonian becomes
=

(13.2)

where
= (wi|AoM .
The second part is the interaction part. In the real-space basis it reads

w = - E / * 1*2 * V i> r i) * V 2>r2) W'(tr2,r 2; ffi.r,) 4,(ff2,r2)* (a „ r1)1
«|W.

(13.3)
where we have specialized to the case where no spin flip processes occur at the vertices,
this firing the case for our coming main examples: electron-electron interactions by
direct Coulomb or phonon-mediated interactions. However, at the end of the chapter
we take an example wrhere the spin flip processes are essential, namely the Hondo
model discussed in Section 10.5. Again, we could express the interactions as in the v
basis, which would transform Eq. (13.3) into

W=\

E

(13.4)

The main goal of this chapter is to derive the Feynman rules for the diagram­
matic expansion in orders of W of the full single-particle M atsubara Green's func­
tion (11.36a),

(13.6)

The diagrammatic technique derived below apphes equally well to the two liases.
Which basis to use, naturally depends on the problem at hand, the most obvious
choice being the basis th at diagonalizes the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian.
For example, in Section 13.4 we take the translational-invariant case for which the
plane wave basis is used. However, because the interaction vertex B(<72. r 2; <T|-rt )
in Eq. (13.3) depends on two coordinates only, whereas Vv,i>a.vav, in Eq. (13.6) de­
pends on four variables, we will use the former, when developing the diagrammatical
technique below.
13.1 T h e p e r tu r b a tio n se rie s for Q
The field operators in Eq. (13.5) defining Q are of course given in the Heisenberg
picture, but using Eq. (11.19) we can immediately transform the expression for Q into
the interaction picture. W ith the short-hand notation ( f f ,, r ,, r , ) = (1), we obtain

Here we need to calculate r-integral of lv (r ). But one precaution must be taken
regarding the ordering of the four operators in the basic two-particle interaction op­
erator. According to Eq. (13.3), the two creation operators must always be to the left
of the two annihilation operators. To make sure of that wo add an infinitesimal time
t) = 0+ to the time-arguments of 'k’ (l) and $*(2), which gives the right ordering

It is only in expressions where the initial and final times coincide th at the infinites­

for Q,

The great advantage of Eq. (13.11) is th at the average of the field operators now in­
volves hare propagation and therm al average both with respect to H0. In fact, using
Eq. (11.68), we recognize th a t the average of the products of field operators in the nu­
merator is the hare (2n+l)-particle Green’s function ^ 2n+l) (ft, 1 , 1' , n'\ a. 1 , 1 ' , n')

cancels the sign in Eq. (13.11). Now is the time for our main use of Wick’s theorem
Eq. (11.82): the hare many-particle Green’s functions in the expression for the full
single-particle Green's function are written in terms of determinants containing the

used in all later calculations.

Draw (2n)! sets of n interaction lines
j '.
For each set connect the 2n vertices with 2n fermion lines: one entering
anti one leaving each vertex. This can be done in (2n)l ways.

(13.13a)

However, also the sign of each term in the expansion of the determinant must be
found. Here, the concept of fermion loops enters the game. A fermion loop is an
uninterrupted sequence of fermion lines s ta rtin g a t some vertex j and ending there
again after connecting to other vertices, e.g.,
or j
The
overall sign coming from the determinant is (—l y , where F is the number onbrmion
loops in the given diagram. An outline of the proof is as follows. The product of the
diagonal terms in the determinant is per definition positive, and diagramatically it
consist of n factors
thus F = 2n is even. All other diagrams can be
constructed one by wle simpljrfiy pairwise interchange of the end-points of the fermion
lines. T his changes the sign from the determinant-expansion of the given product, since

changes the number of fermion loops by 1. e.g.

obtain the last Feynman rule.

and add the resulting diagrams of order n.

For all n there are (2n)l terms or diagrams of order n in the expansion of the
determinant in the denominator {U/f ,0))o of G{b,a) in Eq. (13.12). Suppressing the

Feynman rules for the numerator o f Q(b, a)

The numerator (Tr [Oft , 0 )$ (6) ft!(a)])0 of Q(b, a) differs from the denominator by the
presence of the two external field operators ft (6) and ft 1(a) th at act a t the external
space-time points (6) and (a). This raises the dimension of the nth-order determinant
from 2n to 2 n + l. Consequently, only Feynman rules (4) and (5) given for the denom­

The cancellation o f disconnected Feynman diagrams

It looks like we are drowning in diagrams, but in fact there is a major reduction
at hand. We note that in Eq. (13.16) two classes of diagrams appear: those being
connected into one piece with the external vertices a and 6, the so-called connected
diagrams (e.g., the last second-order diagram), and those consisting of two or more
pieces, the so-called disconnected diagrams (e.g., the first second-order diagram).
Furthermore, we note th at the parts of the diagrams in Eq. (13.16) disconnected from
the external vertices are the same as the diagrams appearing in Eq. (13.14) order by
order. We also note th at a diagram containing two or more disconnected parts can
be written as a product containing one factor for each disconnected part. A detailed
combinatorial analysis (given at the end of this section and in Section 13.6) reveals
that the denominator in Q cancels exactly the disconnected parts of the diagrams in
the numerator leaving only the connected ones.

Being left with only the connected diagrams, we find th at since now all lines in
the diagram are connected in a specific way to the external points a and b, the
combinatorics of the permutations of the internal vertex indices is particularly simple.
There are n! ways to choose the enumeration j of the n interaction line*
and for each line there are two ways to put a given pair of labels j and j ' . We conclude
th at all 2" n! diagrams with the same topology relative to the external points give the
Bamc value. Except for the sign this factor cancels the prefactor f[j(—| ) n , i.e., we are
left with a factor of (—1) for each of the n interaction lines. In conclusion, for pair
interactions the final version of the Feynman rules for expanding Q diagrammatically

(6) Sum over all the topologically different diagrams.

Pay attention to the fact that only the topology of the diagrams is mentioned. Thus
they can be stretched, mirror inverted and otherwise deformed. No notion of a timeaxis is implied in the imaginary time version of the Feynman diagrams.
For completeness, we give the following proof of the cancellation of the discon­
nected diagrams, but the reader may skip it, since the essential conclusion has already
been given above. The proof, which is a special case of the more general proof given
in Section 13.6, contains eight steps. We study the numerator of Eq. (13.12). (1) Since
all internal vertices have one incoming and one outgoing fermion line, the external
vertices a and 6 are always connected. (2) If vertex j somehow is connected to a, so is
j ' due to the interaction line W jjt. (3) In a diagram of order n, a is connected with
r W-lines, where 0 < r < n. The number of disconnected IT-lines is denoted m, i.e.,
m = n - r. (4) In all terms of the expanded numerator, the integral factorizes into a
product of two integrals, one over the 2 r variables connected to a and one over the 2m
variables disconnected from a. (5) The r pairs of vertex variables j and f connected
to a can be chosen out of the available n pairs in n!/[r!(n - r)!] ways, each choice
yielding the same value of the total integral. (6) The structure of the sum is now:

In complete analogy with Fig. 12.3 for impurity-scattering, we can now define the
concept of irreducible diagrams in Q(b, a) in the case of pair interactions based on
Eq. (13.17). As depicted in Fig. 13.1, such diagrams are the ones th at cannot be
cut into two pieces by cutting a single fermion line. Continuing the analogy with the
impurity-scattering case, we can also define the self-energy E ( l,j) as

it is a great advantage to Fourier transform the representation from (r, r)-space to
(q, ig„)-space. Our main example of such a system is the jellium model for Coulombinteracting electrons studied in Section 2.2. In terms of the Fourier transformed in­
teraction IF(q) = A i r e ^ / q 2 , the Coulomb interaction W ( rr ; r ', t ' ) is written as

W (t t \ r V ) = —

Y , w (l)

(13.23)

It is important to realize th at the M atsubara frequency iqn is bosonic since the
Coulomb interaction is bosonic in nature: two fermions are annihilated and two
fermions are created by the interaction, i.e., one boson object is annihilated and one
is created. Furthermore, we note th at due to the factor S ( t —t >) in Eq. (13.10), the
M atsubara frequency iq„ appears only in the argument of the exponential function.
Likewise, using Eq. (11.42), the electron Green’s function £/®(rr, rV /) for spin a
in (k, ifcn)-space can be expressed as

® rr;rV ) = i
^
P V Wife

(13.24)

where ££(k,ifcn) = l / ( i k n —f k) depends on k and ikn , bu t not on u, and £k = ek —fi.
In the case of the Coulomb-interacting electron gas in the jellium model, we thus see
th at the Green’s function
and th e interaction W both depend only on the space and
imaginary tim e differences r —r ' and t —t ' . It follows from Eqs. (13.23) and (13.24) th at
it saves some writing to introduce the four-vector notation k = (k, ikn ), f = ( r ,r ) ,
and ik f = i k - r —iknT. Using this notation we analyze the Fourier transform of the
basic Coulomb-scattering vertex,

jd fd ° (f2 ,f)

e j ( f ,f i ) W ( f 3 - , r )

where the (r, r)-space points r i, f 2 , ^3 , and f are indicated, as are the wave vectors
k, p, and q to be used in the Fourier transform. On top of their usual meaning, the
arrows now also indicate the choice of sign for the four-momentum vectors: k flows
from f i to r, p from f to r 2 , and q from f to r$. Inserting the Fourier transforms of
Eqs. (13.23) and (13.24) into Eq. (13.25), we obtain with this sign convention

(13.26)

From this follows th at in Fourier space the four-momentum (k, ikn ) is conserved at
each Coulomb-scattering vertex: k — p + q. Since each vertex consists of two fermion
lines and one interaction line, the momentum conservation combined with the odd
values of the fermion M atsubara frequencies leads, in agreement with our previous
remarks, to even values for the M atsubara frequencies of the interaction lines. The
momentum conservation rule for each of the 2n vertices also leads to 2n d elta function
constraints on the 2n internal fermion momenta and the interaction line momentA,
and whence the number of independent internal momenta equals n, i.e., the order
of the diagram. For each independent momentum a factor 1$ V remains from the
corresponding Fourier transform. The topology of the diagram in (r, r)-space is not
changed by the Fourier transform. We therefore end up with the following Feynman
rules for the n-order diagrams in the expansion of Qa ( k ,ik n ), where ( k ,ikn ) is to be
interpreted as the externally given four-vector momentum.

relevant to take explicitly into account the infinitesimal shift 7j —►Tj + rj mentioned
in Eqs. (13.9) and (13.10). The factor e1^ follows directly from the Fourier transform
when this shift is included.
In (k, i/cn )-space the third Feynman rule concerning the conservation of fourmomentum at the scattering vertices simplifies many calculations. Most noteworthy is

236

FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS AND PAIR INTERACTIONS

the fact th at Dyson’s equation becomes an algebraic equation. Due to four-momentum
conservation, a four-momentum k j entering a self-energy diagram, such as the ones
shown in Eq. (13.21), must also exit it, i.e., ki = k j. The self-energy (with spin a) is
thus diagonal in k-space,
& .(*, *') = % £ „ ( * ) ,

E»(fc) = S , ( i , k).

The Feynman diagrams are an extremely useful tool to gain an overview of the very
complicated infinite-order perturbation calculation, and they allow one to identify the
im portant processes for a given physical problem. When this p art of the analysis is
done one is (hopefully) left with only a few important diagrams th at then need to
be evaluated. We end this chapter by studying the explicit evaluation of three simple
Feynman diagrams in Fourier space using the Feynman rules (13.27).
13.5.1

The Hartree self-energy diagram

To evaluate a given diagram the first task is to label the fermion and interaction
fines with four-momenta and spin obeying the conservation rules at each vertex, rule
(3) in Eq. (13.27). We start with the so-called Hartree diagram
(which is zero
in the presence of a charge-compensating background), where we in accordance with
Eq. (13.21) strip off the two external fermion lines to obtain the self-energy E w :

H

S2(k,iAn)

(13.31)

The four-momentum transfer along the interaction fine is zero, while the four-momentum
(p, ipn) and the spin o’ in the fermion loop are free to take any value. The self-energy
diagram is a first-order diagram, i.e., n = 1. It contains one internal four-momentum,
(p, ipn). yielding a factor of \jjl V, one internal spin, a', and one fermion loop, i.e.,

(13.32)

Note the need for Feynman rule Eq. (13.27)(6) for evaluating this specific diagram.
The spin sum turns into a simple factor 2. The M atsubara sum can easily be carried
out using the method of Section 11.4.1. The evaluation of the p-integral is elementary
and yields N /2.
According to Eq. (13.30) the self-energy is the interaction-induced renormalization
of the non-interacting single-particle energy. This renormalization we have calculated
by completely different means in Sec. 4.2 using the Hartree-Fock mean field approx­
imation. We see th at the diagrammatic result Eq. (13.32) exactly equals the Hartree
part of the mean field energy in Eq. (4.24b). In other words we have shown th at the
“tadpole” self-energy diagram is the diagrammatic equivalent of the Hartree meanfield approximation.
13.5.2

The Fock self-energy diagram

We treat the Fock diagram

C f(k ,i*„) =

and Fock self-energy E £ similarly:

(13.33)

Once more, the external fermion lines are written explicitly as two factors ££(k, ikn),
leaving the Fock self-energy
to be determined. The four-momentum transferred
by the interaction line is (k - p, ikn - ipn ). This diagram is a first-order diagram, i.e.,
n = 1. It contains one internal four-momentum, (p, ip„), yielding a factor lj? V.
However, in contrast to Eq. (13.31), the internal spin a' is now forced to be equal
to the external spin a. Finally, no fermion loops are present, i.e., F = 0. The Feyn­
man rules therefore lead to the following expression for the Fock self-energy diagram
Eq. (13.33):

Note th at also for this specific diagram we have used Feynman rule (6 ). The spin
smn turned into a simple factor 1. The M atsubara sum can easily be carried out
using the method of Section 11.4.1. The evaluation of the p-integral is in principle
elementary. We see th at this self-energy diagram exactly equals the Fock part of the
energy in Eq. (4.24b) calculated using the Hartree-Fock mean field approximation.
We have thus shown th a t the “half-oyster” self-energy diagram 45 is the diagrammatic
equivalent of the Fock m ean field approximation.
13.5.3

The pair-bubble self-energy diagram

Our last example is the pair-bubble diagram Qj*t which, as we shall see in Chapter 14,
plays a central role in studies of the electron gas. We proceed as in the previous
examples:

£5(k,i/c„)

(13.35)
Removing the two external fermion lines <y°(k, ikn), leaves us with the pair-bubble
self-energy diagram E„ • We immediately note th a t this diagram is of second order,
i.e., n = 2, containing one fermion loop, i.e., F = 1. At the first vertex the incoming
momentum (k, ikn) is split, sending (q, iqn) out through the interaction line, while the
remainder (k—q ,ik n—iqn) continues in the fermion fine. At the fermion loop, (q, iqn)
is joined by the internal fermion momentum (p, ipn) and continues in a new fermion
line as ( p + q , ipn -\-iqn). At the top of the loop, th e momentum ( q , iqn) is sent out
through the interaction line, where it ultimately recombines with the former fermion
momentum (k—q, ikn—iqn). We have thereby ensured th a t the exit momentum equals
th at of the entrance: (k,ikn). The internal degrees of freedom are (q,i<fn ), (p ,ipn),
and o ', the former two yielding a prefactor 1/# V)2. The Feynman rules lead to the
following expression for the pair-bubble self-energy Eq. (13.35):

’A full “oyster” diagram can be seen in Eq. (13.14)

The loop contribution n ° (q , iqn) is traditionally denoted the pair-bubble, and we
shall study it in more detail in the coming chapters. Here we just note th at the
spin sum becomes a factor 2, and th at the M atsubara sum over ipn can easily be
carried out using the method of Section 11.4.1. The evaluation of the p-integral is in
principle elementary. Inserting the result for II 0 (q, iqn ) into the pair-bubble self-energy
diagram (13.35) leads to a bit more involved M atsubara frequency summation over
iqn and momentum integration over q. However, the calculation can be performed,
and we shall return to it later.

Now we show the cancellation of disconnected diagrams for a general Hamiltonian
of the form H 0 + IV, where W is the perturbation. The proof is similar to the one
in Eq. (13.19). We look for the expectation value of some operator j4 (t)B (t'). The
Green’s function studied so far in this chapter is ju st

we. furthermore, absorb the minus sign appearing in Eq. (13.8) by defining V — —IV,

to a given average (Tr Vj • • ■VnA B ) the determinant (or permanent for bosons) gen­
erates a number of terms; a term is said to be disconnected if it can be factorized as
{Tr Vi ■■■V jAB){TTVj ■■■Vn). The connected diagram to the order n in V is thus the
average (Tt Vi • • ■VnA B ) minus all the possible factorizations. We write this condition
in the following way, where all disconnected terms are explicitly subtracted,

(13.40)

where Sn is the perm utation group as in Eq. (1.25). Note th at the last factor can be
decomposed further into disconnected parts. Next, we want to find all the possible
ways th at a connected diagram of order m can be generated in the numerator of
Eq. (13.38). Clearly, the first term appears when n = m in the sum, bu t also higher n
can give a connected diagram of order m. For example, the n = m -\-1 term will give
n terms of the form (Tt Vx • • • Vm A B ) 0 ^ ( ^ ) 0 because there are n different V"s th at
can be factorized out. The term with n — m + 2 will have n (n —1)/2 term s of the form
{Tt Vi ■■• VmA B )Qcon {Kn+iVrn}o etc. Because we can relabel the tim e arguments as
we wish, these n(n — l ) / 2 are all identical. Continuing this argument, we now write
all the term s containing a connected diagram of order m :
I

* i • ■■I

{Tr [!/>,)■ ■■V (r „ ) i ( r ) B ( / ) ] ) o ^

(13.41)

A factor 1/m! can be pulled out of this, and we recognize the parenthesis as the
denominator in Eq. (13.38), which therefore cancels out! We have thus proved th at
Eq. (13.38) can be written as
( I ’r A [T)6{7')) = T . ^ I

As a final step, we can also get rid of the factorial factor, because, as for th e pair
interaction discussed above, one can argue th at each diagram generated by Wick’s
theorem are generated in n! topologically identical variants. Two diagrams are said to
be topologically identical if they can be made identical after permuting their internal
time arguments. The final expression for the general way to construct diagrams for
the expectation value (T t A ( t )B ( t ')) is therefore

So far we have derived the diagram technique for two-particle interactions or for
interactions, where tie can use W ick's theorem. Here we take a different example,
namely the Kondo model, which was introduced in Section 10.5. In Chapter 10 we
studied the model in the context of interacting mesoscopic systems. The reason for
studying this case here is also to alert the reader to the fact th at when dealing with
spin operators, the diagram technique has to be revised. The Kondo model reads
H = H 0 + H j,

(13.44)

where H 0 describes the non-interacting electron gas,

ktr

while H j represents the interaction with the localized spin degree of freedom,
H , = . / £ S . S kk,
kk'

(13.46)

Here S j is the spin operator for the local spin, and
S k , k . = X > L ’V„,<v,,.

(13.47)

a o'

is the operator for the electron gas spin th at couples to the localized spin. Remember
th at r = ^( t x , t v, t z ) contains the three Pauli spin matrices defined in Eq. (1.91).
The Hamiltonian th at governs the impurity spin is here equal to zero, because the
system is isotropic. However, if an external magnetic field is applied, we must add a
term S,, B to the Hamiltonian. Also the electron gas is isotropic in spin, because the
energy ft, does not depend on spin at all.
As for the pair interaction in Eq. (13.8), our strategy is to expand the Green’s
function
G (k*r, k W ) = - ( T r [ < w ( r ) 4 ,^ ( r ') ] )
(13.48)
in powers of the interaction H j in analogy to Eq. (13.38). We could try to utilize
the general principles derived in Section 13.6. There is, however, one caveat, namely
th at Wick's theorem does not apply to the spin operators. This means, e.g., th at an
average
(ti)& (T 2 )Sk (t 3 )S 1(T4 }} does not factorize into averages of pairs. Conse­
quently, we must derive a new set of rules for this kind of interaction. The number of
disconnected diagrams that are cancelled out is thus reduced to the ones where the
electron operators defining the Green’s function, i.e., cktr(r) and cjt,ff/ ( r /) are fully

242

disconnected from the rest. Also the concept of ‘'topologically different" has to he
revisited. It only works if we can argue th at the average

-S ‘- (r m) ] ) ,

(13.49)

docs not change under a perm utation of the tim e arguments. Of course, since the
tim e ordering determines the order of the operators, the only concern is possible sign
changes caused by the relabelling of the time arguments. Because the spin o|>erators
conserves the number of fermions, they behave like bosons in this respect, which for
example can be seen from the fermion representation in Eq. (1.92). Thus, we only
have to count topologically identical electron diagrams once and omit the 1/n ! factor.

The different diagrams up to third order in J are shown in Fig. 13.2. A number
of these vanish because of the isotropic assumption, i.e., no magnetic field and no
spin polarization. First of all, the linear term in J is zero because (5) = 0. Second,
the diagrams which have fermion loops are zero for the following reasons. A loop
with a single fermion line forces the Pauli spin m atrix in the vertex to be diagonal
and after summation over spin, one has a trace: TV[t'] = 0. A loop with two fermion
lines th at appears in the third order diagram gives rise to a trace over two Pauli spin
matrices, Tr(r‘r J) = 6 , y and because the trace over th e three spin operators gives

(see Section 13.7.2), we end up with a factor £,^<5^ = 0, where
t tjk is the Lovi-Civita symbol defined in Eq. (1.11). Thus we can supplement the rules
in Eq. (13.48) by the condition that all fermion lines must connect to the end point
of the diagram.

multiplied by the density of impurities as in Section 12.5. Only in the next leading

In this chapter, we have established the Feynman rules for writing down the Feyn­
man diagrams constituting the infinite-order perturbation expansion of the full single­
particle Green’s functions. Our main example was the Coulomb interaction, bu t we
also showed how other types of interactions can be analyzed by the diagrammatic
technique. Later in Chapter 17, we derive the Feynman rule for yet another type of
interactions, namely the electron-phonon interactions.
The Feynman diagram technique enables a systematic analysis of the infinitely
many terms that need to be taken into account in a given calculation. Using the
Feynman diagrammatic analysis one can, as we shall see in the following chapters,
identify which subclasses of diagrams th at give the most important contributions. We
have already given explicit examples of how to evaluate some of the diagrams that
are going to play an im portant role. Indeed, we show in Chapter 14 th at the diagrams
analyzed in Eqs. (13.34) and (13.37) are the ones th at dominate the physics of the
interacting electron gas in the high-density limit. We shall learn how these diagrams
determine the groundstate energy of the system as well as its dielectric properties
such as static and dynamic screening.
For other books treating the diagram technique, see for example Mahan (1990),
M attuck (1976), Fetter and Walecka (1971), Doniach and Sondheimer (1974), Rickayzen (1991), and Schrieffer (1983).

40In fact, when deriving the Kondo model from the Anderson model as in Chapter 10, one can
relate the spectral function in Eq. (10.56) to the self-energy calculated here and therefore obtain
Eq. (10.113) from Eq. (13.61) (see also Exercise 10.8).

14
THE INTERACTING ELECTRON GAS
In Section 2.2 we studied the Coulomb interaction as a pert ur hat ion to the noninteracting electron gas in the jellium model. This was expected to be a valid proce­
dure in the high density limit, where according to Eq. (2.35) the interaction energy
is negligible. Nevertheless, the second-order perturbation analysis of Section 2.2.2 re­
vealed a divergence in the contribution
from the direct processes (see Eq. (2.49)).
In this chapter, we reanalyze the Coulomb-interacting electron gas in the jellium
model using the Feynman diagram technique, and we show how a meaningful finite
groundstate energy can be found, l b ensure well-behaved finite integrals during our
analysis we work with the Yukawa-potential with an artificial range 1/ a instead of
the pure long-range Coulomb potential (see Eq. (1.102) and the associated footnote),

w'( r - r ') = j F ^ e‘ “ |r- r' 1’

<14'»

The range 1 /a has no physical origin. At the end a t the calculation we take the limit
a -¥ 0 to recover the Coulomb interaction. For example, with the Yukawa potential
we can obtain a finite value for

reappears as soon as we take the limit a —►0 ,

The main result of the following diagrammatic calculation is th at the dynamics of the
interacting system by itself creates a renormalization of the pine Coulomb interac­
tion into a Yukawa-like potential independent of the value of a , which then without
problems can be taken to zero. The starting point of the theory is the self-energy

is given by the sum of all the irreducible diagrams in &a (k. ikn ) removing the two ex­
ternal fermion lines ££(k,iA:n). We recall th at due to the charge-compensating back­
ground in the jellium model, the Hartree self-energy diagram

14.1.2

The divergence number o f self-energy diagrams

The singular nature of the Yukawa-modified Coulomb potential Eq. (14.1) in the
limit of small q and a leads to a divergent behavior of the self-energy integrals. The
more interaction lines carrying the same momentum there are in a given diagram,
the more divergent is this diagram. For example (taking a = 0), two lines with the
momentum q contributes with IF (q )2 which diverges as q~ 1 for q -* 0 independent
of the behavior of any other internal momentum p in the diagram. In contrast, two
lines with different momenta q and q - p contributes with VF(q)H'(q - p), which
diverges as q~* only when both g —►0 and p —►0 at the same time, i.e., in a set of
measure zero in the integral over q and p.
In view of this discussion it is natural to define a divergence number 6 in> o f the

the largest number of interaction lines in

Consider two diagrams E*"'1* and E*n,2) of the same order n. W ith one notable
exception, it is in general not possible to determine which diagram is the larger liascd
alone on knowledge of the divergence number. The exception involves the diagram
with the maxima] divergence number, i.e., wben all n momenta in the diagram arc
the same. In the limit o -> 0, this diagram is the largest:

RPA resummation o f the self-energy

Using the order n and the divergence number S, we now order the self-energy diagrams
in a (n, (S)-table. According to Eqs. (14.7) and (14.9), the most important terms are
those in the diagonal in this table where S = n. Examples of some of the entries in
the (n,datable are the following diagrams with 1 < 6 < n = 4, shown in Eq. (14.10)

It is clear that the most important diagrams in the high-density limit are those having
a low order. For each given order, the diagrams with the highest divergence number

numerous applications. For metals k„ « 0.1 nm -1 .
We now turn to the more general case, but limit the calculation of x 0 (q,u/-Hty) to

using the Sommerfeld expansion or by numerical integration. In the low tem perature

The electron-hole pair interpretation o f RPA

We have learned above th at the RPA results in a screened Coulomb interaction.
Tb gain some physical insight into the nature of this renormalization, we study the
pair-bubble diagram a little closer in the (q, ^-representation. Choosing r > 0 in
Eq. ( 1 1 .8 6 ), we arrive at
Xo( q . r > 0 ) = - £

/ ^ ( V

( T) 4 ° > ° < 4 w ( T>cP+4°>°-

(14.31)

Consequently, we can interpret Xo(*li t > 0) as the sum of all processes of the following
type: a t r = 0 an electron is created in the state |ptr) and a hole in the state |p 4- q<r),
which correspond to an electron jumping from the latter state to the former. At
the later time t the process is reversed, and the electron falls back into the hole
state. In the time interval from 0 to r an electron-hole pair is thus present, hut
this corresponds to a polarization of the electron gas. and we now see the origin of
the renormalization of the Coulomb interaction. The RPA scheme takes interaction
processes into account thus changing the dielectric properties of the non-interacting
electron gas. The imaginary part of x ^(q.u.'). describes the corresponding dissipative
processes, where momentum q and energy uj is absorbed by the electron gas (see also
the discussion in Section 8.5).
In the remaining sections of the chapter we study how the effective RPA interaction
influences the groundstate energy and the dielectric properties (in linear response) of
the electron gas.

To improve the high-density, second-order perturbation theory of Section 2.2, we
include in Eq. (14.41) all diagrams up to second order and, through RPA, the most
divergent diagram of each of the higher orders. Since the self-energy £ contains di­

method, in casu resummation of the Feynman diagram series for the single-electron
self-energy and Green’s function, we could finally solve the problem posed by the
failed second-order perturbation theory.
Having achieved this solution, we will also be able to study other aspects of the
interacting electron gas. In the following we focus on the dielectric properties of the
system.

Already from Eq. (14.16) it is clear th at the internal dynamics of the interacting
electron gas lead to a screening of the pure Coulomb interaction. One suspects that
also external potentials <j)ext will be screened similarly; and indeed, as we shall see
below, this is in fact the case. As in Section 6.4, we study the linear response of the
interacting system due to the perturbation H ' caused by 0 GXt,
(14.46)
where p (r) is the particle density and not, as in Section 6.4, the charge density. Since
the unperturbed system even with its Coulomb-interacting electrons is translation
invariant, we write all expressions in Fourier (q,o;)-space. The external potential
<jWt(q,^) creates an induced charge density —ep-lnd (q ,w). Through the Coulomb in­
teraction this in turn corresponds to an induced potential

We divide by e2, since W (q) by definition contains this factor. Next step is to use the
Kubo formula, which relates [—e />jnd(r, w)] with the external potential and with the
retarded density-density correlator,
= ( - e ) 2 c £ ( q . - q ,u ) 0 „ ,(q ,u ) = e2 X *(q,") 0mt(q,in).

(14.48)

Collecting our partial results, we have

Here the subscript “eq” refers to averaging in equilibrium, i.e.. with respect to H =

in terms of the polarization function \ R,

<H„,(q.u) = *«,(q,w ) + *„,t(q,u) = [ 1 + IF(q) x“ ( q ,u ) ] &*.(q.w).

When recalling th at <j>u* corresponds to the electric field E. and <W to the displace­
ment field D = f 0 cE, we see th at the following expression for the dielectric function
or electrical perm ittivity e has been derived:

(14.52)

So upon calculating x w(q,w ), we can determine e(q,u;). But according to Eq. (11.33)
and the specific calculation in Section 11.7, we can obtain )f*(q,w ) by analytic con­
tinuation of the corresponding M atsubara Green’s function

where x(q. *9 n ) is the imaginary-time Fourier transform of x(q, r ) given by Eq. (11.84),
x ( q .r ) = —^ ( T t p(q, t ) ^»(—q , 0 ) )^ .

(14.54)

We will calculate the latter Green’s function using the Feynman diagram technique.
From Eq. (1.94) we can read off the Fourier transform p(±q):

Here, as in Eq. (13.9), q = 0+ has been inserted to ensure correct ordering, and we
have divided the contributions to x into two parts. One p art where the two density

mix. The disconnected p art is zero since the expectation of the charge density in the
neutralized and homogeneous jellium model is zero. The second term has a structure
similar to the simple pair-bubble diagram with an external momentum q flowing
through it.
It is now possible to apply the Feynman rules Eq. (13.27) directly and to write the
diagrammatic expansion in (q, iqn)-space of x(q, ign) = x(?)- We only have to pay
special attention to rule (4), where for the single-particle Green’s function, it is stated
th at the diagrams must contain two Green’s functions with the external momentum
k. This rule was a direct consequence of the definition of (7(k, r),

14.5.1

Plasma oscillations and plasmons

The plasma frequency is an important param eter of the interacting electron gas set­
ting the energy scale for several processes, e.g., it marks the limit below which metals
reflect incoming electromagnetic radiation, and above which they become transparent.
Typical values are to » 1016 Hz, putting it in the ultraviolet part of the electromag­
netic spectrum. It is determined by the electron density n and the effective band
mass m of Eq. (2.16). The former param eter can be found by Hall-effect measure­
ments, while the latter can be determined from de Haas-van Alphen effect.40 Using
the observed param eters for aluminum, n — 1.81 x 1O20 m - 2 and m = 1.115 mo, we
obtain
= 2.27 x 1016 Hz = 15.0 eV.
A very direct manifestation of the plasmon frequency is the existence of the collec­
tive charge density oscillations, the plasma oscillations. Theoretically, the existence
of these oscillations is proved as follows. Consider the relation D = e e0E or the
related one, <£ext(q)W) = e(q,o;) <£tot(q,a>). Note th at s(q,w ) = 0 in fact allows for
a situation where the total potential varies in space and time in the absence of any
external potential driving these variations. We are thus about to identify an oscil­
latory eigenmode for the electron gas. Let us calculate its properties in RPA from
Eq. (14.76),
eHPA(q,w ) = 0

=>■ w2 m w2 + - (qvF) 2

=>

u(q) m u p + — ^

q2. (14.78)

Recall th a t in the high frequency regime Im \o and consequently Im c is zero, so no
damping occurs. Thus by Eq. (14.78) it is indeed possible to find oscillatory eigenmodes, the plasma oscillations. They have a simple quadratic dispersion relation uj(q)
starting out from aip for q = 0 and then going up as q is increased.
But how could one be convinced of the existence of these oscillations? One beau­
tiful and very direct verification is the experiment discussed in Fig. 14.1. If some
eigenmodes exist with a frequency ~ wp, then, as is the case with any harmonic os­
cillator, they m ust be quantized leading to oscillator quanta, denoted plasmons, with
a characteristic energy of uip. In the experiment, high energy electrons with an initial
energy Ei = 20 keV are shot through a 258 nm wide aluminum foil. The final energy,
E f, is measured on the other side of the foil, and the energy loss Ei —E f can be plot­
ted. The result of the measurement is shown in Fig. 14.1(a). The energy loss clearly
happens in quanta of size A E . Some electrons traverse the foil without exciting any
plasmons (the first peak), others excite one or more as sketched in Fig. 14.1(b). On
the plot, electrons exciting as many as seven plasmons are clearly seen. Note th at
the most probable process is not the plasmon-free traversal, but instead a traversal
during which two plasmons are excited. The value of the energy loss quantum was
measured to be A E = 14.8 eV in very good agreement with the value of the plasma
frequency of 15.0 eV for bulk aluminum.
4BThe de Haas-van Alphen effect is oscillations in the magnetization o f a system as the function
of an applied external magnetic field. The Fermi surface can be mapped out using this technique as
described in Ashcroft and Mermin (1981).

zero scattering angle on the other side of the foil. The energy loss Ei - E f clearly
reveals loss in quanta of A E . The energy quantum A E was found to be 14.8 eV

Landau damping

Finally, we discuss the damping of excitations, which is described by the imaginary
part Im \„*(q.u;). T he pure plasma oscillations discussed above are examples of un­
damped or long-lived excitations. This can be elucidated by going to the retarded
functions in Eq. (14.68)

(11.79)

In regions of the (g,w) plan where the imaginary part of \ 0 vanishes, we can have a
pole in Eq. (14.79) with a real frequency. However, in regions where Im \ § ^ 0 we end
up with a broadened (Lorentzian-type) peak as a function of w. signaling a temporal
decay of the total potential with a decay tim e proportional to Im \ § ,

(14.80)

In Eq. (14.30), we have within RPA calculated the region in the (9 , w)-plane of non­
vanishing Imxp , and this region is shown in Fig. 14.2. The physical origin of the non­
zero imaginary part is the ability for the electron gas to absorb incoming energy by
generating electron-hole pairs. Outside the appropriate area in ( 9 ,u/)-spacc, energy
and momentum constraints prohibit the excitation of electron-hole pairs, and the
electron gas cannot absorb energy by th at mechanism.

The variables are rescaled according to Eq. (14.27): x = q/2kp and xo = w /4 rF.
Note th at Im X^(q,u>) ^ 0 only in the gray-scaled area, which is bounded by
the constraint functions given in Eq. (14.30). Also shown is the plastnon branch
with its propagating and damped parts. The param eters chosen for this branch
are those of aluminum, eF = 11.7 eV and a/p = 15.0 eV.
Another way to understand the effect of a non-vanishing Im
is to link it to the
conductivity a of the electron gas. I t is well known th at the real part of a is associated
with dissipation (Joule heating), when a current J is flowing. But from Eq. (6.45) it
follows that
e2 Im *o = - ~ q (R eo )-q ,

(14.81)

whereby it is explicitly confirmed th at a non-vanishing Im \a is associated with the
ability of the system to dissipate energy.
Finally, we remark th at in Fig. 14.2 is shown the dispersion relation for the plasmon
excitation. It starts out as a bona fide excitation in the region of the (q. u )-space where
the RPA dissipation is zero. Hence the plasmons have infinite life times for small q.
However, a t some point the dispersion curve crosses into the dissipative Im x 0 ^ 0
area, and there the plasmon acquires a finite life time. In other words, for high qvalucs the plasmonic excitations are not exact eigenmodes of the system, and they
are damped out as a function of time. In th e literature, this damping mechanism is
called Landau damping.

many other physical phenomena involving the electron gas.

15
FERMI LIQUID THEORY
The concept of Fermi liquid theory was developed by Landau in 1957-59 and later
refined by others .50 The basic conclusion is th at a gas of interacting particles can be
described by a system of almost non-interacting “q u a sip a rtic le sT h e se quasiparticles
are approximate excitations of the system a t sufficiently short tim e scales. W hat we
mean by “sufficiently short” of course has to be quantified, and this condition will set
the limits for the applicability of the theory.
The Fermi liquid theory is conceptually extremely important, because it explains
why the apparently immensely complicated system of, e.g., interacting electrons in
a metal can be regarded as a gas of non-interacting particles. This is an enormous
simplification, and it gives the theoretical explanation of why all the results that one
obtains from the widely used free-electron model work so well.
The quasiparticle concept furthermore gives the theoretical foundation of the semiclassical description. The quasiparticle distribution function satisfies a kinetic equa­
tion, which may include scattering from one state to another for example due to
impurity scattering. This equation is known as the Landau transport equation, and is
equivalent to the well-known Boltzmann equation from kinetic gas theory. In this de­
scription the potential is allowed to vary in space due to some external pcrturliation or
due to interactions with the inhomogeneous density of quasiparticles. Using the Lan­
dau transport equation we shall see th at the collective modes derived in the previous
chapter also come out naturally from a semi-classical description and, furthermore,
th at also the conductivity, which is calculated from microscopic considerations in
Chapter 16, can be understood in terms of scattering of quasiparticles.

15.1

A diabatic continuity

The Fermi liquid theory is based on the assumption that starting from the non­
interacting system of particles, one can analyze the interacting case by applying per­
turbation theory. This is, in fact, a rather stringent criterion, because it means th at
one cannot cross a phase boundary line. Take, for instance, the ferromagnetic transi­
tion described in Section 4.5: starting from the paramagnetic phase it is impossible
by perturbation theory to reach the ferromagnetic phase .51
If the excitations of the non-interacting system are connected to the excitations of
the interacting system by a one-to-one correspondence (at least on short timescales
as explained below), the two cases are said to be connected by “adiabatic continuity".
^Soo tho collection of reprints In the book: D. Pines The Many-body problem, Addison Wesley
(1961. 1997).
51This fact can bo understood from the concept of broken symmetry explained In Sactlon 4.4. The
phase with broken symmetry can only occur if the ensemble of states in the statistical average Is
truncatod.
266

267

ADIABATIC CONTINUITY

If we imagine th at we start from the non-interacting system excited in some state
and then turn on the interaction adiabatically, i.e., so slowly th a t the occupation
numbers are not changed, then we would end up in a corresponding excited state of
the interacting system.
15.1.1

Example: one-dimensional well

As a simple example of adiabatic continuity, we consider a particle trapped in a ID
potential. The ID potential will have a number of bound states w ith discrete eigenenergies and a continuum of eigenenergies corresponding to th e delocalized states. We
now imagine changing the potential slowly. As an example, consider a potential of the
form
V (M ) = - H W

■

(15.1)

The depth of the well is time dependent, and let us suppose th a t it is changing from
an initial value Voi to a final value Vo2 - If this change is slow, the solution of the
Schrodinger equation
=

( — + V X z,*))

(15.2)

can be approximated by the adiabatic solution

exp ( - i E v .w 1) .

(15.3)

where
t ^ie solution of the static (or instantaneous) Schrodinger equation
with energy E Vo(t),
*f(‘Wv.,(*) W =

( 15-4)

Note th at both V,vb(t)(ar) an(^ ^V6(t) depend parametrically on the time through Vo(t).
The accuracy of the solution in Eq. (15.3) is estim ated by inserting Eq. (15.3) into
Eq. (15.2), which yields
t) =

+ i ( 8 ' ^ ^ ’^ ) ( 8 ^ ^ ) = (15.5)

Thus, we have an approximate solution if the first term dominates over the second
term.
Apparently our conclusion is th a t if the rate of change of Vo(t) is small enough,
the solution for the new value of Vo = V02 can be found by starting from the solution
with the old value of Vo = Voi and “adiabatically” changing it to its new value. For
example, if the first excited state is a bound state, it will change to a somewhat
modified state with a somewhat modified energy, but most importantly it is still the
first excited state and is still a bound state. This may sound completely trivial, but
it is not, and it is not always true. For example if the real solution during this change
of Vo from Voi to V02 changes from a bound state to an unbound state (if Vo2 is
small enough there is only one bound state), then it does not m atter how slowly

FERM I LIQUID THEORY

we change V0. The two states can simply not be connected through small changes
of Vo, because one is a decaying function and the other is an oscillatory function.
This is an example where perturbation theory to any order would never give tin? right
answer. The important message is, however, th at if we avoid these transitions between
different kinds of states, adiabatic continuity does work. In the following this idea is
applied to the case of interacting particles.
15.1.2

The quasiparticle concept and conserved quantities

The principle of adiabatic continuity is now applied to study a system of interacting
particles. It is used to bring the excitations of the interacting case back to the wellknown excitations of the non-interacting case, thus making computation possible. In
doing so, we gain the fundamental understanding th at the interacting and the non­
interacting cases haw a lot in common a t least under some restricting circumstances.
This turns out to be realized in many systems. T he following arguments arc not meant
to be the full theoretical explanation for the applicability of Fermi liquid theory, but
rather to giw a physical intuition for the reason why the quasiparticle picture is valid.
When calculating physical quantities, such as spectral functions, response func­
tions or occupation numbers, wTe are facing m atrix elements between different states,
for instance, between states with added particles or added particle-hole pairs. Since
we are dealing with the low-energy properties of the system, let us consider states
with single particles or single electron-hole pairs added to the groundstate
|(k * ),) = c jJ C > .

| M , ; ( k V ) t > = 4 „ I W |C )> etc.,

(15.8)

where |C) is the groundstate of the interacting system. The first term inserts a particle
while the second term creates both a particle and hole.
Imagine letting time evolve according to a Hamiltonian w'here the interaction is
gradually switched off at a rate C
J/< = H 0 + J W < ' ,

t > 0.

(15.7)

If, under the conditions of adiabaticity, we can bring the states Eq. (15.6) all the way
back to the non-interacting case, then the m atrix elements are identical to those of
the non-interacting case. There are two important assumptions built into this con­
struction:
1. The adiabatic procedure is valid w*hen the energy of the state is large
compared to the rate of change, i.e., £k„ 3> C, or, since typical excitation
energies are of order of the tem perature, this is equivalent to assuming
IcbT > <.
2. The interactions do not induce transitions among the states in question,
or in other words the lifetime 7iife of the state is long compared to C- 1 ,
th a t is Tjifc > C- i .
This apparently leaves an energy window where the idea makes sense, namely
when we can choose a switch-off rate C such th at

269

SEMI-CLASSICAL TREATMENT OF SCREENING AND PLASMONS
T ^ < £ C < & k BT .

(1 5 .8 )

The Inst condition can in principle always be met at high enough temperatures,
whereas the first one is not necessarily possible. Below we shall see th at it is in­
deed possible to make the approximations consistent .52 because the lifetime turns out
to be inversely proportional to the square of the tem perature,
<x T2. Thus there
is always a tem perature range a t low tem perature where Eq. (15.8) is fulfilled.
Next, we discuss the properties of the s tate with an added particle, |(kff)p). It is
d e a r th at the state where the interaction is switched off has a number of properties in
common with the initial state, namely those th at are conserved by the Hamiltonian:
(i) it has an excess charge e (compared to the groundstate), (ii) It carries current
—e h k /m , and (tit) it has excess spin a. These properties are all conserved quantities
because the corresponding operators (i) the total charge Q = —eN, (ii) the total
current J e = - e £ ko v knk(T, and (3) the total spin S —£ k„ a n ko all commute with
the Hamiltonian.
Most importantly, the adiabatic continuity principle can also be used to relate the
distribution function to the distribution function of non-interacting particles, l.e., the
Fermi Dirac distribution function. This leads us to the definition of quaslparticlcs:
Quasiparticles describe excitations of the interacting Bystem corresponding
to the creation or annihilation of particles (e.g., particle-hole pair state
|(k<7 )p; (k V )i,)) in an intermediate tim e window: short enough th at the state
does not decay due to electron-electron scattering, but long enough to ensure
a well-defined energy of the quasiparticle. The quasiparticles are thus not to
be thought of as the exact eigenstates.
The quasiparticles can be labelled by the same quantum numbers as in
the non-interacting case, provided th at the corresponding operators commute
with the Hamiltonian. For a translation-invariant system of electrons inter­
acting through the Coulomb interaction, the quasiparticle quantum numbers
are thus k and a and they carry charge —e and velocity v k = h k /m .
At low tem peratures there are only7 a few weakly interacting quasi­
particles. In equilibrium these are distributed according to the Fermi Dirac
distribution function.
In the following we make use of the quasiparticle concept to calculate the screening
and the transport properties of an electron gas.

In Chapter 14 we saw how the collective modes of a charged Fermi gas came out of
a rigorous diagrammatical analysis. Here, we shall rederive some of this using a less
rigorous but maybe physically more appealing approach. Consider a uniform electron
gas which is subject to an external potential

Now, if the local potential of the quasiparticles is space and time dependent, so is then
the density of quasiparticles. T his in tu rn changes the electrical potential, because the
quasiparticles are charged, and therefore the total potential <£>tot is given by the sum
of the external potential <>ex, and the induced potential
The induced potential
is caused by the excess or deficit of quasiparticles. Thus we write the resulting local
potential ^ ( r . l ) as

SEMI-CLASSICAL TREATMENT OF SCREENING AND PLASMONS

15.2.2

Dynamical screening

In the dynamical case, we expect to find collective excitations similar to the plnsmons
found in Section 14.5. In order to treat this case we need to refine the analysis a hit
to allow for the time it takes the charge to adjust to the varying external potential.
Consequently, the induced charge density a t point r at tim e f now depends on the
total potential at some other point r ' and at some other (previous) time t'. The
way to describe this, is to look at the deviation of the distribution function rik of a
quasiparticle with a given momentum p = ftk (below we as usual use h = 1). This
depends on both r and t, so th at
"k = nfc(t)(r,i)-

(15.15)

The dynamics are controlled by two things: th e conservation of charge and the change
of momentum with time. The first dependence arises from the flow' of the distribution
function. Because we are interested in times shorter than the lifetime of the quasipar­
ticles, the number of quasiparticles in each k state is conserved The conservation of
particles in state k is expressed through the continuity equation
n k + Vr - jk = 0 ,

(15.16)

where the current carried of quasiparticles in state k is given by jk = v ^ k =
(hk/m)r»k, and hence we obtain
ft(n k ) + k - V k«k + vk • V r nk = 0,

(15.17)

which is known as the collision-free Boltzmann equation.54
The second dependence follows from how a negatively charged particle is acceler­
ated in a field, i.e., simply from Newton’s law
p = - ( - e ) V iA o t( r ,0 -

(15.18)

Again, it is convenient to use Fourier space and introducing the Fourier transform
n k (q .u ). Using Eqs. (15.17) and (15.18), we find

O ur last application of the semi-classical approach is the calculation of conductivity
of a uniform electron gas with some embedded impurities. This will in fact lead us
to the famous Drude formula. Historically, the Drude formula was first derived in an
incorrect way. namely by assuming th at the charge carriers form a classical gas. We
know now that they follow a Fermi-Dirac distribution, but amazingly the result turns
out to l>e the same. In Section 16 we will furthermore see, how the very same result
can be derived in a microscopic quantum theory starting from the Kubo formula and
using a diagrammatic approach.
As explained in Chapter 10, the finite resistivity of metals a t low tem peratures is
due to scattering against impurities or other imperfections in the crystal structure.
These collisions take momentum out of the electron system, thus introducing a mech­
anism for momentum relaxation and hence resistivity. A simple-minded approach to
conductivity would be to say th at the forces acting on a small volume of charge is the
sum of the external force and a friction force th a t is taken to be proportional to the
velocity of the fluid at the given point. In steady state these forces balance and hence

hkf. For non-magnetic impurities, the ones considered here, the spin is conserved and
thus a = a '. The new scattering process thus introduced means th at the number
of quasiparticles in a given k-state is no longer conserved and we have to modify
Eq. (15.16) to take into account the processes th at change the occupation number rife.
The rate of change is given by the rate, r(k V « —k<r). at which scattering from the
state |k<7) to some other s tate |k W ) occurs. It can be found from Fermi's golden rule
T ( k W k<7) = 2ir |{k’(r|Vto,p|k<r)|2 S(& - €k>).

(15.25)

where Vjmp is the impurity potential. The fact th at the scattering on an externa]
potential is an elastic scattering process, is reflected in the energy-conserving delta
function. T he total impurity potential is a sum over single impurity potentials situated
at positions R ,, see Chapter 12,
‘W M = £ “ (r -■*<)•

(15.26)

We can then find the rate T by the adiabatic procedure, where the matrix clement

Of course, we do not know the location of the impurities exactly and therefore we
perform a positional average. The average is done assuming only lowest order scatter­
ing, i.e., leaving out interference between scattering on different impurities. Therefore
we can simply replace the sum over impurities by the number of scattering centers,
Nimp = n lmpV, and multiplied by the impurity potential for a single impurity u(r).

The Boltzmann equation for impurity scattering is rather easily solved in the linear

which agrees with Eq. (15.24) found by the simplified analysis. The reason th at the
two approaches give the same result is th at we can treat the quasiparticle as being

Eq. (15.24) is indeed applicable to each quasiparticle separately.

where n£ is the equilibrium distribution function, and To is the relaxation time. This
approximation in fact gives the correct answer if the relaxation tim e is identified
with the transport tim e To = r u . At first sight, it is tem pting to think of the To
as the time for scattering out of the state k , i.e., the lifetime of the state k. This
would, however, only give the first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (15.31) and it
is therefore incorrect. The lifetime, which was also calculated in Eq. (12.49), is given
by the first Born approximation,

Tlife

(15.42)

This tim e expresses the rate for scattering out of a given state k, bu t it does not
tell us how much the momentum is degraded by the scattering process. This is pre­
cisely what the additional cosine term in Eq. (15.38) accounts for. If the quasiparticle

276

FERMI LIQUID THEORY

scatters forward, i.e., cos 0 ss 1, the state k is destroyed bu t the momentum is al­
most conserved and such a process therefore does not effect the conductivity. On the
contrary when the particle is scattered backward, i.e., cos# « —1, there is a large
change in momentum, corresponding to a large momentum relaxation. Therefore the
transport tim e is precisely the momentum-relaxation tim e defined in the simple fluid
dynamical picture in Eq. (15.24).
15.3.1

Finite lifetime o f the quasiparticles

Above we first assumed th a t the quasiparticles have an infinite lifetime. Then we
included some finite lifetime induced by scattering against impurities. But we never
included scattering of quasiparticle on other quasiparticles. Here we investigate the
validity of this approach by studying the rate of quasiparticle-quasiparticle scatter­
ing. Clearly, there is a mechanism for quasiparticle scattering against quasiparticles
because they are charged and therefore interact through the Coulomb interaction.
The interaction between the particles is screened by the other particles and we should
use the RPA result for the interaction. The Coulomb interactions thus introduces a
two-particle scattering where momentum and energy are exchanged, but total mo­
mentum and total energy are conserved in the scattering event. If two particles in
states |kcr;kV'} scatter, the final state will be a state |k 4- qo; k ' - qtr'), such th at
the initial and the final energies are the same fk + £ k ' = £ k + q+ £k'-q or counting from
the chemical potential £k + £k' = £k+q+fk'-g- The rate for quasiparticle-quasiparticle
scattering can be calculated using Fermi’s golden rule,

(15.43)

where H/RPA(q) is the RPA-screened Coulomb interaction. From this rate we can
obtain the total rate for changing the state of a given quasiparticle in state |ktr) by
the Coulomb interaction. The total rate is found by multiplying T with the probability
th at the state |k V ) is occupied and th at the final states are unoccupied and then
summing over all possible k ' and q. So the result for this “lifetime" 7k of the state

the Fermi surface th at gives rise to a finite lifetime of the quasiparticles, (b) Both
momentum and energy have to be conserved. This together with the Pauli principle
cause the phase space available for the scattering to be very limited as illustrated.
The dashed circle indicates the energy of the initial state. Since the particle can
only loose energy, the other particle which is scattered out of state k ' can only
gain energy. Furthermore, because of the Pauli principle the final states of both
particles have to lie outside the Fermi surface and therefore the phase space volume
for the final state k + q (white area) and for the initial state k ' (light gray area)
both scale with 4k giving rise to a maximum phase space (47rfcp£k)2 oc
k 4- q. B ut for now we just want the energy dependence of the lifetime. A simple
phase space argument gives the answer (see also Fig. 15.1). We look at the situation
with a particle above the Fermi surface 4k > 0. Suppose then we have integrated out
the angle dependence, which takes care of the delta function. At T = 0 this gives the
condition th at 4k + Ck' —4k+q > 0- Then we are left with two energy integrals over
4k' = 4f < 0 and 4k'-q = £" > 0- We then have

This is a very im portant result because it tells us th a t the lifetime of the quasiparticles
diverges as we approach the Fermi level and thus the notion of quasiparticles is a
consistent picture. At finite tem perature, the typical excitation energy is k g T and 4k
is replaced by k g T

for T > 4*.

(15.46)

The conclusion from the analysis is th at the lifetime of the quasiparticles based
on Fermi’s golden rule diverges at low tem peratures and therefore the condition for
the adiabatic approach expressed in Eq. (15.8) holds as long the tem perature is much
smaller than the Fermi energy. Because the Fermi energy in, e.g., a metal in general is

278

FERMI LIQUID THEORY

a fairly large energy scale, Eq. (2.27), the condition in fact holds for even moderately
elevated tem peratures. As illustrated in Fig. 15.1 the physical reason for the smallness
of the scattering rate is that although the Coulomb scattering m atrix elements are
big, the Pauli principle severely restricts the phase space available for scattering.

Renormalization o f the single particle Green’s function

The Fermi liquid theory relies on the assumption th at the excitation created by adding
a particle to the system can be described by a free particle, a quasiparticle, with a
long lifetime. The function th at measures precisely the density of states for adding
particles is the retarded Green’s function G R. If the retarded Green’s function of the
interacting system turns out to be similar to th at of free particles, the quasiparticle
picture will have a real physical meaning. This is what we are going to show in this
section and thereby give a microscopic foundation of the Fermi liquid theory.
We consider the one-particle retarded Green’s function, which in general can be
written as
<15'47>
where & = k 2/ 2 m —p is the free electron energy measured with th e respect to the
chemical potential p, and where E fl(k,w ) is the irreducible retarded self-energy. To
calculate the self-energy we should in principle include all possible diagrams, which of
course is not possible in the general case. Fortunately, im portant conclusions can be
drawn from the first non-trivial approximation, namely the RPA which in Chapter 12
was shown to give the exact answer in the high-density limit. Let us first write the
general form of G R by separating the self-energy in real and imaginary parts,

GR(

<15'48)

We then anticipate the quasiparticle picture by looking at k-values close to the
kp, meaning close to the renormalized Fermi energy. The renormalized Fermi wave
number k p is defined by the condition th a t the real part of the energy vanishes
^jSr + ReE(fcjr,0) = 0. At small energies and for k close to kp , we can expand (Gfl)-1
in powers of k — kp and u), which leads to

In Section 15.3.1 we saw th a t the lifetime goes to infinity a t low temperatures. If this
also holds here the spectral function therefore has a Lorentzian shape near k = ky.
For a very small imaginary part we could namely approximate Im Y. 11
—r/, and
hence Eq. (15.49) gives
A(k, ui) = —21m G * (k , w) » 2nZ 6 (u - & ).

(15.55)

This shows that with a small imaginary part, the Green’s function and the spectral
function has a sharp peak a t w = £k . The peaked spectral function therefore resembles
th at of a free gas and the pole is identified as the quasiparticle that was defined in
the Fermi liquid theory. However, because the general sum rule
/ ” ^

(k . “0 = 1

(15.50)

is not fulfilled by Eq. (15.55), the integral only amounts to Z , the quasiparticle peak
cannot be the whole story. There must be another part of the spectral function, which
we denote A', th at has an integrated weight given by 1 —Z . See Fig. 15.2. Therefore
we instead write
A (k , u ) = 2wZ 6{lj - £ k) + A'{k , u ),
(15.57)
where the remaining contribution A not associated with the pole, contains more
complicated raany-body excitations not describable by a free-electron like peak. The
constant Z is called the renormalization constant and it is a measure of the quasi­
particle weight. Typically Z is found from experiments to be between 0.7 and 1 for
r , < 3, w'here r , = (3/47ra$n)-1/ 3 is the density param eter of the electron gas, see
Eq. (2.37). The renormalization constant show's up, e.g., in the distribution function
n(k), where the jum p a t the Fermi level is a direct measure of Z . For a discussion
on the measurements of Z using Compton scattering (see, e.g., the book by Malian
(1990)).
Wc still need to show th at the assumption of a large rk is valid, so we now turn
to evaluating the imaginary part of the self-energy.

seen to cancel parts of the counters C\ and C2 so th at they are modified to run between

also enclose the pole in z = £k+q —

Let us study the occupation factors in this expression and compare with the Fermi's

At low tem perature, the first term is due to the energy conservation condition non-zero
for & > 0, while the last term is non-zero for £k < 0. The first term thus corresponds
to the scattering-out term in Eq. (15.44), while the second term corresponds to the
scattering in term. If we furthermore approximate £k —£k+q
0 in eRPA we now
see that the lifetime in Eq. (15.65) is equivalent to the Fermi’s golden rule expression
Eq. (15.44). We have thus verified th at the imaginary p art of the retarded Green’s

function indeed goes to zero. At least when employing the RPA approximation for
the self-energy, but the RPA approximation in Chapter 12 was shown to be exact in
the high-density limit. An explicit calculation of Eq. (15.65) was done by Quinn and
Ferrell55 who got
(15.68)
Going beyond RPA, it can in fact be shown th at the imaginary part vanishes to all
orders in the interaction. This was done by Luttinger56 who proved th at the imaginary
part of any diagram for the self-energy goes to zero as £2 or faster. The derivation is
rather lengthy and we do not give it here. It is however not hard to imagine th at more
complicated scattering events th an the simple one depicted in Fig. 15.1 will have even
more constraints on the energies. Hence after integration, they will result in higher
powers of & . This concludes our analysis of the single-particle Green’s function. The
analysis indeed confirmed the physical picture pu t forward by Landau in his Fermi
liquid theory.
15.4.3

Mass renormalization?

In the previous section we saw how the assumption of weakly interacting quasipar­
ticles was justified by the long lifetime of the single-particle Green's function. We
also found th at the effective mass of the quasiparticle was renormalized due to the
interactions. This seems to contradict the postulate of the Fermi liquid theory that
the current of the quasiparticles is independent of interactions, i.e., it is given by k /m
and not k/m *. The bare velocity of the quasiparticles was important for obtaining the
Dnide formula for the conductivity, a = ne2Ttr/m . How come the renormalized mass
m* appears in the Green’s function whereas the physically observable conductivity
contains the bare mass m? The answer to this question is found by studying how the
conductivity is calculated diagrammatically. As we remember from the Kuho formula,
the conductivity is related to the current-current correlation function. The calculation
has to be done in a consistent way, such th at the diagrams included in the irreducible
self-energy, are also included in the diagrams feu- the two-particle correlation function.
W hen the same type of diagrams are included both in the self-energy and in the lines
th at cross the two-particle "bubble*’ then the mass renormalization exactly cancels. In
Section 16.4 we shall see an explicit example of this, by calculating diagrammatically
the finite resistance due to impurity scattering starting from the fully microscopic
theory.

We have developed the semi-classical Fermi liquid theory of interacting particles.
The theory is valid whenever perturbation theory is valid, i.e., when the interaction
docs not induce a phase transition. Almost miraculously, the interacting system of
particles can be described by a gas of non-interacting particles. We call these particles
quasiparticles and they can be labelled by the same quantum numbers ns those of the

non-interacting system, provided th at the corresponding operators also commute with
the full Hamiltonian. For a translation-invariant system the quantum numbers are k
and a.
On long length and timescales, we can use a semi-classical approach to study
various properties. This approach is based on the Boltzmann equation
Qt{nk) + k V knk + v k ■V r n k = ( — ^

.

(15.69)

V a l /c o llis io n s

This equation is extremely useful, since in many situations it gives a sufficiently
accurate description of the physics. It has been widely used to explain numerous
transport phenomena in gases and solids. One can include both electric and magnetic
fields driving the system out of equilibrium. The driving fields enter through the
Lorentz force as p = ftk = (—e )(E + v x B). On the right-hand side of Eq. (15.69) we
have included collisions due to impurities and particle-particle collisions. One can also
include, e.g., particle-phonon scattering in solids and thus explain the tem perature
dependence of the different transport coefficients.
Landau's phenomenological theory was shown to be justified by a rigorous micro­
scopic calculation, using the random phase approximation result for the self-energy.
The result of this analysis was th a t even in the presence of interactions does the Fermi
surface persist, and near the Fermi surface the imaginary part of the single-particle
Green’s function rapidly vanish as
Im E B(fcF ,<-) <xmax(ez,T 2).

(15.70)

This explains why the Fermi liquid theory works: when the imaginary part goes to
zero the single-particle Green’s function is identical to that of a free particle.

16

IMPURITY SCATTERING AND CONDUCTIVITY
We now return to the problem of calculating the resistance of a metallic conductor
due to scattering against impurities. The basic physics of impurity scattering was dis­
cussed in Chapter 12, where we saw* how the single-particle Green’s function acquired
a finite lifetime after averaging over the positions of the impurities. In Chapter 15 the
conductivity was calculated within the Boltzmann equation approach. We now red­
erive the Boltzmann equation result starting from a microscopic quantum approach.
The advantage of this microscopic approach, besides giving a first principle justifica­
tion of the Boltzmann equation, is th at it can be extended to include correlation and
coherence effects th at cannot be described in the semi-classical Boltzmann approach.
In order to get familiar with the techniques, wre therefore sta rt by deriving the semiclassical result. Then we go on to include the quantum mechanical effect known as
weak localization, which is due to interference between time reversed paths. Weak
localization involves coherent scattering on many impurities, and it can therefore not
be explained semi-classically.
In 1979 the weak localization correction to resistivity was observed experimentally
in large 2D samples at low temperatures. It was explained theoretically later the same
year, and an extended research wras initiated on the role of quantum coherence in
transport properties. A few years later another low-temperature interference effect, the
so-called universal conductance fluctuations, was discovered in small ( ~ pin) phasecoherent structures. This discovery started the m odem field of mesoscopic physics.
To understand these smaller systems one must take into account the finite size of the
conductors, which was the topic in C hapter 10. In this chapter we deal with extended
systems and discuss the most important disorder-induced quantum corrections. The
leading quantum correction is precisely the weak localization effect in 2D.57 We also
discuss quantum corrections to the average conductance of mesoscopic samples.
Based on the physical picture th at emerged from the Fermi liquid description in
Chapter 15, we assume in the first part of this chapter th at we can describe the
electrons as non-interacting. In the second part of the chapter we include electronelectron interactions together with impurity' scattering and explicitly demonstrate
th at the non-interacting approximation is valid. This means th at we shall see how
the mass renormalization discussed in Sec. 16.4 is canceled out. Furthermore, we
shall see th at in order to obtain meaningful results, it is absolutely imperative to
include vertex corrections to the current-current correlation bubble diagrams. These
corrections cannot be treated by evaluating only single-particle Green’s functions.
57In ID, things arc more complicated because there all states are localized. In 3D, the situation Is
again (ItfTorcnt In that at some critical amount o f impurity scattering there exists a metol-lnsulator
transition known as the Anderson localization.

They are thus genuine two-particle correlation effects, which can he described by
diagrams where interaction lines “cross” the bubble diagrams.

Let us start by the Kuho formula for the electrical conductivity tensor
given in
Eq. (6.24) in terms of the retarded current-current correlation function (6.25). Here,
we shall only look at the dissipative part of the conductivity, and therefore we take
the real part of Eq. (6.24),

Reo^ (r,r#;w) = —— Imll^ (r,i/,(d).

(16.1)

Note th at the last, so-called “diamagnetic ” term of a in Eq. (6.24) drops out of the real
part. In the following we therefore only include the first, so-called “paramagnetic",
term in Eq. (6.24), denoted <rv . For a translation-invariant system we consider as
usual the Fourier transform

In this chapter we consider only homogeneous translation-invariant systems, i.e. the
conductivity tensor is isotropic and therefore diagonal,

In particular, we have no magnetic field and take A = 0. In the computation we
can choose a to be the x direction. Note th at the system is translation invariant
even in the presence of impurities after performing the position average described in
Chapter 12.
As usual, we calculate the retarded function starting from the corresponding Matsuhara function. The M atsubara current-current correlation function is

We can now draw diagrams for the current-current correlation function using the
Feynman rules. The procedure is analogous to th a t for the charge-charge correlation
function in Chapter 13, however, here we include both the impurity lines • - - -jQt

We can perform a partial summation of diagrams to all orders by replacing each

resummcd Eq. (16.12) and are left with bubble diagrams where the only interaction
and impurity lines to be drawn are those connecting the lower and upper electron
Green's functions. Eq. (16.12) then becomes

The next step is to organize the diagrams according to the lines crossing the bubbles
from the upper to the lower fermion line in a systematic way. These diagrams are
denoted vertex corrections. To obtain a Dyson equation for IITT. we first introduce
the irreducible line-crossing diagram AirT consisting of the sum of all possible diagrams
connecting the upper and lower fermion line, which cannot be cut into two pieces by
cutting both the upper and the lower line just once,50

Using Alrr we see th at we can resum all diagrams in IIIX in the following way

S0Wo do not include diagrams like the terms 9, 10 , and 11 in Eq. (16.13). Diagrams of this type
are proportional to q~ 2 and thus they vanish in the limit q -» 0.

The notation for the arguments of the T functions is T — r ( “out going” , “in going” ).
The question is now which diagrams to include in Alrr. We have seen examples of
how to choose the physically most important self-energies, both for the impurity scat­
tering problem in Chapter 12 and for the case of interacting particles in Chapter 13.
In the present case, once the approximation for £ irr is chosen, the answer is simply
th at there is no freedom left in the choice for the vertex function P. If we include
certain diagrams for the self-energy, we must include the corresponding diagrams in

THE CONDUCTIVITY IN TERMS OF A GENERAL VERTEX FUNCTION

the vertex function. This follows from a general relation, called the Ward identity,
between the self-energy and the vertex function. The Ward identity is derived from
the continuity equation, so not fulfilling it is equivalent to not conserving the numt>er
of particles. Therefore, a physically sensible approximation must obey W ard's iden­
tity, and one uses the term “conserving approximation" for th e correct choice for the
vertex function. We shall not derive the Ward identity here,60 but simply use the
following rule dictated by the Ward identity: if an irreducible diagram is included in
E lrT. the corresponding diagrams should also be included in Airr.
If we consider the first Born approximation and RPA for £ irr as depicted in

go on general principles. To proceed further, one must look at the specific physical
cases and then solve for the vertex function satisfying Eq. (16.21b) and insert the
result into (16.34). In the following we consider various cases, but only those where
the disorder is weak. In the next section it is shown that for this case, the product
G n G A exceeds G AG A by a factor of order 1/ ( t E f ). where t is the scattering time
for impurity scattering. Hence in the weak-disorder limit, we may replace tl>e genera]

The conductivity in th e first Born approxim ation

The conductivity wras calculated in Sec. 15.3 using a semi-classical approximation
for the scattering against the impurities. The semi-classical approximation is similar
to the first Bom approximation in th a t it only includes scattering against a single
impurity and neglects interference effects. Therefore, we expect to reproduce the semiclassical result, if we only include the first Bom approximation in our diagrammatical
calculation. The starting point in this section is non-interacting electrons scattering
on impurities. The RPA part of the self-energy in Eq. (16.15) is not included in this
section. Later we discuss what happens if interactions are included.

IMPURITY SCATTERING AND CONDUCTIVITY

The vertex function is now solved using the first Born approximation, i.e. the first
diagram in Eq. (16.22). In this case, again taking q = 0, the integral equation (16.23)

The Green’s functions Q are, as we learned from the Ward identity, also those obtained
in the first Born approximation. Note th at there is no internal M atsubara sum, liecause the impurity scattering conserves energy. Since we do not expect the dynamical
screening to be important for the elastic scattering, we set the frequency in eRPA(q,0)
to zero. Remembering th at Tt is a component of a vector function T. and th at the
unperturbed vertex is r 0(k ,k ) = k /m , we define for convenience a scalar function
7 (k ,r) as T(k, e) = k y (k ,£ )/m . In doing so, we in fact use th at the system is isotropic
which means th at only the vector k can give the direction. When inserting this into
Eq. (16.35), multiplying by (l/fc2)k-, and shifting the variable q ' to q ' = k ' - k, we

to be simply 7 RX(k ,f) ss 1. It is immediately seen th at this is a consistent solution
for the imaginary part of both
and ')RR, bu t it turns ou t th at for the real part
of 7 Ra a factor \/n \mv is contained in the Green's function. The lesson we learn here
is th at we have to be rather careful with products of Green's function carrying the
same arguments, because in the limit of small nimp, Im Gx tends to a delta function,
and the product of two delta functions has to be defined with care. Let us look more
carefully into the products GAG R and G RG R, which also appear in Eq. (16.34). The
first combination is

whore A = -2 1 m G R is the spectral function, and where, as before, the lifetime t
is defined by r -1 = —2 lm E R(k,e). For the case of weak impurity scattering the
scattering rate r " 1 is so small th at the spectral function can be approximated by a
delta funct ion. In the case of small n imp, we therefore obtain
G ^(k, c)G *(k, e) « t 2 k 6 ( e - & ) .

Because t oc n ^ p, the product n impGAG R in Eq. (16.37) is finite in the limit

The last term clearly goes to zero when r is large, and A can be approximated
by a delta function. The first term is a peaked function at c = 0 , but the
integrated weight is in fact zero as can be checked by performing an integration
over & . From these arguments it follows th at th e terms with G RG R can be om itted
and only terms with G RG A are kept. As explained above, we use the first Born
approximation for the self-energy. In the following we therefore approximate r with
the first Born approximation lifetime r0.

As expected, this is in full agreement with the semi-classical result obtained in the

corrections not obtainable in the Boltzmann approach.

In Chapter 15 and in the introduction to this chapter, it was discussed how the
apparent contradiction th a t the mass, according to the microscopic derivation of the
quasiparticle pole in Section 15.4.1, is renormalized by interactions and yet, general
arguments based on momentum conservation show th at it is the bare mass th a t should
appear in the Drude formula.
This problem can in fact be resolved if we combine both impurity scattering and
interactions in the diagrammatical analysis. The impurity scattering is again consid­
ered to be weak, such th at the first Born approximation suffices, and the interactions

CONDUCTIVITY FROM BORN SCATTERING WITH INTERACTIONS

297

are included in the RPA approximation for the self-energy. This treatm ent follows the
spirit of Section 15.4.1. Furthermore, to be consistent, we must include the dressed
electron lines inside the self-energy, such th at the electron line in the first Born ap­
proximation diagram is the RPA-dressed electron line.
The vertex corrections, which are consistent with this set of self-energies, are
precisely the ladder diagrams shown in Eqs. (16.22) and (16.23). Tb simplify the
arguments will make to two assumptions about th e wave vector dependence of the
interactions. First, we take the impurities to be be short-range scatterer so th a t in
q-space we replace u(q) by a constant potential u. Also, the Coulomb interaction is
considered to be short-ranged due to screening, and again we replace W RPA(q, iqn)
by its small q value, lF RPA(0,ign). These approximations, which are not essential for
the validity of our arguments, imply th a t IV(q) in Eq. (16.24) does not depend on q.
The reason for using this simplification is th at the vertex corrections in Eq. (16.23)
cancels. This is seen by verifying th a t r z = k }m is a solution to Eq. (16.23)

r*(k, k ]ikn 4- iqn, ikn) = Fo,x(k, k)

x r*(k + q ', k + q';ifcn 4-*g„,tk„),

(16.50)

because the term s with <5(k 4- q ') only depends on the length of k 4- q ', and so the
second term cancels upon the summation over q '. See also Exercise 16.1.
The conductivity then follows from the general formula in Eq. (16.34)
R ea„ =

E

^ [ C '* ( k ,0 )GR(k ,0 ) “ g A( M ) g - * (M )],

(16.51)

Since we also here consider the weak impurity-scattering limit, the imaginary part
of the self-energy stemming from the impurity scattering is small. Moreover, a t low
tem peratures it is valid to assume th at the imaginary p art of the self-energy due to
electron-electron interactions is small as well. This was indeed the prime argument for
the consistency of Fermi liquid theory in the preceding chapter. We take Im £ RPA <g;
Im £ lBA, and thus our previous arguments holds: only the first term in Eq. (16.51) is
important. Using Eq. (16.38) in this term results in
° xx =

(16.52)

where Tq is the renormalized lifetime in the Born approximation, and A(k, 0) is the
spectral function, which in the RPA is A(k, 0) = Z£(£*,), see Eq. (15.57). Performing
the integral as in Eq. (16.42) then gives

where we used the renormalized result for £ while kp is not renormalized, because it

When this inserted hack into Eq. (16.53), we see the renormalized mass cancels out,

The Born approximation includes only scattering on one impurity at a time. We saw
in Chapter 10 that there was in practice only little difference between the first Born
and the full Born approximation. The reason is th at even the full Bora approximation
depicted in Eq. (12.54), which does take into account multiple scattering docs so only
for multiple scatterings on the same impurity. Quantum effects such as interference
between scattering on different impurities can therefore not be incorporated within
the Born approximation scheme. In Sec. 12.5.4 it was hinted th at such interference
processes are represented by crossing diagrams as in Fig. 12.6. In this section we shall
study in detail why that is so.
As the tem perature is lowered, we expect quantum mechanical coherence to be­
come more important because the phase coherence length
increases with decreasing
tem perature. When the coherence length
exceeds the mean free path fjmp for im­
purity scattering, scattering on different impurities can interfere. Here, the coherence
length means the scale on which the electrons preserve their quantum mechanical
phase, i.c. the scale on which the wavefunction evolves according to the one-particle
Schrddinger equation. If an electron interacts with another electron or with a phonon
through an inelastic scattering event, its energy changes, and hence the evolution of its
phase. Due to these processes, the phase of the electron wave acquires some random­
ization or “dephasing." and its coherence length becomes finite. At low temperatures
the dominant dephasing mechanism is electron-electron scattering, and as we know
from Chapter 13, the scattering rate for these processes is proportional to T 2. Hence
(+ <x T ~ 2 can become very large at sufficiently low temperatures. At liquid helium
temperaturez, 4.2 K and below, typical coherence lengths are of the order 1-10 /an,
equivalent to 104 105 atomic lattice spacings.
If the coherence length £+ is longer than the mean free path ( q, but still smaller
than the sample size £ , most of the interference effects disappear. This is because
the limit £*
£ effectively corresponds to averaging over many small Independent
segments, the so-called self-averaging illustrated in Fig. 12.2. However, around 1980

F ig . 16.2. (a) A sketch of the electrical resistivity pxx{T) of a disordered metal as a
function of temperature. As in Fig. 12.1, th e linear behavior at high tem peratures
is due to electron-phonon scattering, but now at low tem peratures we have added
the small but significant increase due to the quantum interference known as weak
localization, (b) An outline of the experimental d ata from measurements on a thin
PdAu film showing th at the low-temperature weak-localization correction to the
resistivity increases logarithmically as the tem perature decreases. The actual d ata

it was found through the observation of the so-called weak localization, shown in
Fig. 16.2, that even in the case of large samples,
£ , one very important class
of interference processes survive the self-averaging. Naturally, as discovered around
1985, much more dramatic quantum effects appear in small samples in the so-called
mesoscopic regime (see also Chapter 7) given by £ ~ £+. In this regime all kinds
of quantum interference processes become im portant, and most notably cause the
appearance of the universal conductance fluctuations shown in Fig. (12.2).
In the following we study only the weak localization phenomenon appearing in
large samples and not the universal conductance fluctuations appearing in small sam­
ples. l b picture how averaging over impurity configurations influences the interference
effects, we follow an electron after it has been scattered to a state with momentum k
by an impurity positioned at R x. W hen the electron hits th e next impurity at position
R 2 it has acquired a phase factor e*^ = e,k'(H,»-R a). Terms describing interference
between the two scattering events will thus contain the factor e«MRi-Ra)t and ft is
therefore intuitively clear that these terms vanish when one averages over R x and
R 2. Only the interference processes which are independent of the impurity positions
survive self-averaging.
Interference generally means th a t the amplitude for two paths £x and t 2 are added
as i x + f2, so th at when taking the absolute square |tx 4- t2|2 = |t i|2 + |t2|2 +
2|fx£2| cos(<£x — <j>2), the cross-term expresses the interference. The relative phase
<j) i —fa determines whether the contributions from the two paths interfere construc­
tively or destructively. If we can find two paths where the relative phase is independent
of the position of the impurities, the cross-term would thus survive the impurity av­
erage. This is indeed possible, and two such paths are shown in Fig. 16.3. The key
observation is th a t for each path that ends in the starting point after a specific se­
quence of scattering events, there is a corresponding reverse p ath which scatters on

the same impurities but in the opposite order. Most remarkahly, these two paths pick
up exactly the same phase factor, and thus their relative phase fa —fa is always zero,
independent of the actual positions of the impurities. Thus for two such time-reversed
paths there is always constructive interference. As a consequence there is an enhanced
probability for returning to the same point, and the electrons therefore tend to l>e
localized in space, hence the name “weak localization” .61
Having realized th at the interference between time-reversed paths survive impurity
averaging, we now want to calculate the resulting correction to the conductivity.
In order to do so we need to identify the corresponding diagrams. First, we recall
the Dyson equation for the single-particle Green’s functions in an external potential,
which was derived in Chapter 10. Here, the external potential is given by the impurity
potential, t/|mp. Writing it in the frequency domain and making analytic continuation,
ikn —» e 4- iff. we have for th e retarded Green’s function
C R(r, r \ e) = C § (r, r \ e) + J <tr” G « ( r , r '\ f )r/„11|1(r")G,'(r". r ' . t ) .

(16.56)

Let us look a t a specific process where an electron scatters at, say, two impurities
located a t R i and R 2 . To study interference effects between scattering at these two
impurities we must expand to second order in the impurity potential. The interesting
second-order term s (there are also less-interesting ones where the electron scatters on
the same impurities twice) are

(16.57)

These two terms correspond to the transmission amplitudes 11 and 12 discussed above
and illustrated in Fig. 16.3. The probability for the process is obtained from the
absolute square of the Green’s function, and because we want to find the correction
£ |r|2 to the reflection coefficient, we set r = r' a t the end of the calculation. First the
quantum correction due to interference to the transmission from r to r' is

(16.58)

Now reflection is described by setting r = r '. Doing this and averaging over impurity
positions R i and R 2 we find the quantum correction <S|r|2 to the reflection. In k-space

(16.59)
This formula can be represented by a diagram similar to the last one in Eq. (16.25)
with the upper lines being retarded and the lower lines being advanced Green’s func­
tions. Notice however th at, contrary to a usual diagram for conductance, the Green's
functions in the lower and upper branch run in same direction. However, if we twist the
lower branch such th at the Green's functions run in opposite directions (thus allowing
the impurity lines to cross) and furthermore join the retarded and advanced Green’s
function a t the ends, then the diagram looks like a normal conductivity diagram.

(16.60)

This hints th at the interference term coming from time-reversed paths can be summed
by taking diagrams of this form into account. These crossed diagrams were not in­
cluded in the Born approximation, which we used to derive the Boltzmann equation
result, and in fact they were shown in Sec. 12.5.4 to be smaller than the Born ap­
proximation by a factor 1/fcjrf. Nevertheless, at low tem peratures they do play a role
as the leading quantum correction. If we continue this line of reasoning we should
include also diagrams where paths scattering on more than two impurities interfere

302

IMPURITY SCATTERING AND CONDUCTIVITY

with their time-reversed counter parts. It is straightforward to see th a t the corre­
sponding diagrams are of the same type as (16.60) but with more crossing lines. This
class of diagrams is called the maximally crossed diagrams. We have now identified
which diagrams we need to sum in order to get the leading quantum correction to the
conductivity. Most importantly, this is a contribution which does not disappear upon
self-averaging.
Let us return to the Kubo formula for conductance, and let us sum the maximally
crossed diagrams. We write the current-current correlation function as II = IIB-f IIWL
where
is the Boltzmann result derived in the previous section, and where
(16.61)

+

(16.62)

The full electron Green’s functions in these diagrams are as before the full Green’s
function with an appropriately chosen self-energy. Since we include crossed diagrams
in the vertex function we should in principle also include these in the self-energy.
However, they can safely be ignored, since they only give a small contribution, dow'n by
a factor l/fcFuFr 0 (see the discussion in Fig. 12.6). T he crossed diagrams we are about
to evaluate are also small by the same factor, b u t as we shall see they nevertheless
yield a divergent contribution. This divergence stems from summing the interference
of many time-reversed paths. This sum is different from the ladder diagrams th at
we summed in the Born approximation. There is however a trick which allows for a
summation just like a ladder diagram. Let us twist the diagram in Eq. (16.62) with
for example three impurity fines so as to make the impurity fines parallel,

n^L<3)(<?)=

(16.63)

Then we see th a t the full series in Eq. (16.62) can be written as

where the box C is a sum of parallel impurity lines, i.e. analogous to the normal
diffuson ladder sum of Eq. (16.25), but now with the fermion lines running in the same
direction. This reversed ladder sum C is called a cooper on. The cooperon couples two
electron lines or two hole lines, while a diffuson couples one electron line and one hole
line. The solution for the cooperon C is found from the following Dyson-like equation:

In order to simplify our calculation, we only study the case q = 0, and further­
more we restrict the analysis to the case of short-range impurities so th at we can
approximate W (q) by a constant, W0 = n itnp|u0|2. W ith these approximations, and
denoting k + k ' = Q , the cooperon becomes

In the previous section we learned th at only the GAG R term in Eq. (16.34) con­
tributed in the limit of weak scattering and therefore we should replace ikn + iq„ by a
retarded frequency and ikn by an advanced frequency. Likewise, we obtain the weak

and ik„ - » e - irj, followed by insertion of the result into Eq. (16.34). Taking the

As in the previous section we have factors of G AG R appearing. However, here we
cannot replace them by delta functions, because k and k ' are connected through
C fl-4( k + k ). Instead we evaluate the cooperon as follows. After analytical continuation

from values of Q near zero. Consequently, we study this contribution by expanding
Eq. (16.72) for small Q. Here small means small compared the width r0-1 of the spec­

2D. Physically this is because we have allowed interference between path of infinite
length, which does not occur in reality. In a real system the electron cannot main­
tain coherence over arbitrarily long distances due to scattering processes th at cause
decoherence. We must therefore find a method to cut off these unphysical paths. To
properly describe the breaking of phase coherence between the time-reversed patlis
one should include coupling to other degrees of freedom such as coupling to phonons
or electron-electron scatterings. Here, we choose to do this In a phenomenological
fashion instead. Let us suppose th at each path in the sum over paths in Eq. (16.66)
has a probability of being destroyed by a scattering event and th at this probability
is proportional to the length of the path, or equivalently to the number of impurity
scattering events involved in the path. This can be modeled by including a factor e - 7
in the impurity potential so that instead of W0 we write Woe- 1 . Clearly a path with
n scatterings will then carry a factor e- "7. The param eter 7 is then interpreted as
the amount of decoherence experienced within a mean free path, i.e. 7 = lo/l+. W ith
this modification, the function C(Q) is changed into
C(Q,o/) « e - 7 ( l —D r0Qi* ) ,

This is an important result, which states th at due to the localization correction the
conductivity decreases with increasing phase coherence time. Furthermore, in the ID
case it tells us that in ID the localization correction is enormously important and
may exceed the Drude result. In fact it can be shown th at a quantum particle in a
ID disordered potential is always localized. In 3D the situation is more subtle, there
a metal-insulator transition occurs at a critical value of the disorder strength. 2D is
in between these two cases, and it is in this case th at the term “weak" localization
makes sense, because here the correction is small. For the 2D case we have

This result is “universal” since, apart from the logarithmic factor, it does not de­
pend on the details of the material or the impurity concentration. T hat it is a small
correction to the Drude conductivity can be seen from the ratio

A way to measure this effect is to change the phase coherence time Tj, and to look at the
change of conductivity. The phase coherence can be changed in two ways. Foremost,
one can apply a magnetic field wThich breaks the time-reversal symmetry giving rise
to the fundamental interference between time-reversed paths. Second, decreasing the
tem perature increases the phase coherence tim e r ^ 1 oc T a , and a logarithmic increase
of the conductivity is to be expected. Indeed Sp oc —6a oc In r* oc —In T as is measured

IMPURITY SCATTERING AND CONDUCTIVITY

16.6

D is o rd e re d m esosco p ic sy ste m s

So far we have studied averages over impurity configurations in bulk systems, and
learned how to calculate the conductance due to scattering on random impurities. In
this section, we briefly touch upon how to study the average properties of disordered
mesoscopic systems.
In experiments on mesoscopic systems, such as quantum dots in semiconductor
heterostructures, the geometry of the system is most likely not well-defined. One can­
not precisely neither determine nor control the position of the walls and the impurities.
Instead, one studies the statistical properties of the conductance for an ensemble of
systems. The average and the variance of the conductance will turn out to exhibit
interesting quantum phenomena, namely weak localization and universal conductance
fluctuations, respectively. In order to understand these two phenomena, we must first
learn about how to average over 5-matrices.
In Chapter 7 we calculated the conductance for a given realization of a mesoscopic
conductor by finding the transmission coefficients, or equivalently the scattering ma­
trix, and then inserting these into th e Landauer formula. The statistical properties
are probed by varying either the geometry via the gate potentials, the Fermi level, or
an external magnetic field. If the transmission coefficients are sufficiently sensitive to
these external parameters, one often assumes th at one effectively makes an ensemble
average over all possible configurations.
W ithout any further knowledge or constraints, this implies an assumption about
the ensemble of 5-matrices, namely th at all unitary matrixes are equally likely, or
in other words th at the distribution P (S ) of scattering matrices S is uniform in the
group of unitary matrices of size 2N x 21V, denoted U(2N).
Such ensemble averaged have been studied for a long time, initially in atomic nuclei
containing a large number of nucleons. The basic assumption being made there was
th at the Hamiltonians describing each of the systems of the ensemble are drawn ran­
domly according to some probability distribution only constrained by the symmetry
of the system. This statistical m ethod is known as random m atrix theory (RMT).
In this brief introduction, we do neither cover the large field of RM T nor its
application to mesoscopic physics. The interested reader could consult the book by
M ahta (1991) and the reviews by Stone et al. (1991), Beenakker (1997), and Alhassid
(2000) for further studies.
16.6.1

Statistics of quantum conductance, random matrix theory

Here, we will not be concerned with the microscopic justification for the ensemble
averaging, but simply say th at since we have no information about the scattering
m atrix the m ost sensible thing to assume is th at all scattering matrices in U (2N) will
appear with equal probability only subject to symmetry constraints.
For the time-reversal symmetry case, we are therefore restricted to symmetric
members of U (2N ). The ensemble of 5-matrixes for the time-reversal case can thus
be realized by w riting the 5-m atrix as a product of the two general unitary matrixes
S = U U 7', where U € U (2N ). Clearly, this would generate all symmetric unitary
matrixes.
For the statistical analysis we are going to carry out, we will need moments up to

DISORDERED MESOSCOPIC SYSTEMS

fourth order. One method to derive the ensemble average of some function / ( U ) of a
random m atrix U is to utilize th a t if U is multiplied by some constant unitary V , the
average should be invariant, because we simply make a constant “shift” in U(2N),
where all matrixes are equally likely. In other words, (/(U )) = (/(V U )) = {/(U V )).
The first moment of the unitary ensemble is the average of a single unitary matrix
is (U f ), where (■) here denotes ensemble average. According to the principle stated
above, this average must for any matrix V € U{2N) fulfill (U^ ) =
y)Vg =
Kry(^# }> the only solution being (U^ ) = 0.
The second moment is determined in a similar way
( K J i 1> = E ( 'C -W *0

(16.91)

A solution to this equation is (U£al£ &} oc Sab, which is seen by inspection. In the same
spirit, we see th at (U*al£ &) oc
by multiplying by V from the left. Now we know
th at {U*aQ b) oc C S^Stf , where C is a normalization factor which we determine from
the trace as
2N = UU* =

C * 1 = C (2N f ,
(16.92)

and hence C = 1/2 N .
The fourth moment can be derived using the same method and considerably more
work. For a random unitary m atrix of dimension M = 2N , we find the averages

The first term in Eq. (16.93c) is equivalent to assuming the real and imaginary parts
of Uaa to be independent, while the last term corrects for th at because the unitarity
condition gives some constraints on the elements of U . These correlations however
become less important in limit of large M .
16.6.2

Weak localization in mesoscopic systems

In the previous section we studied the weak localization in self-averaging macroscopic
samples. The origin of this effect was found to be the constructive interference be­
tween time-reversed pairs of paths. The weak localization correction was the leading
quantum correction th a t survived the impurity average. For the mesoscopic system,
we also find quantum corrections th at remain after the ensemble average. This is
seen by using the random m atrix theory for the 5-matrix. According to the Landauer
formula derived in Chapter 7, the average conductance is

The result now depends on w hether the system has time-reversal symmetry Is present
or not. As shown in Chapter 7 the time-reversal symmetry is broken by an applied
B-ficld. First consider the case of broken time-reversal symmetry. B ^ 0. In this case,
there are no other constraints on S than th at it is unitary', and we can therefore use
Eq. (16.93b) directly,
<16'85>
Next, we consider the case B = 0 where, as shown in Section 7.1.4, the 5 -m atrix is
symmetric. This condition is fulfilled by representing S as S = U U r . and hence we
have

This result clearly shows that quantum corrections, which come from the last term in
Eq. ( 16.93c), give a reduced conductance and th at the quantum coherence is destroyed
by a magnetic field. Of course in reality the transition from the B = 0 to the finite
B-ficld case is a smooth transition. The transition happens when the flux enclosed liy
a typical trajectory is of order the flux quantum , which we see from the arguments
leading to Eq. (7.64).
16.6.3

Universal conductance fluctuations

The fluctuations of the conductance contains some interesting information about the
nature of the eigenstates of a chaotic system. Historically, the study of these fluctu­
ations were the first in the field of mesoscopic transport. They were observed experi­
mentally around 1980 and explained theoretically about five years later.
It is an experimental fact that the fluctuations tu rn out to be independent of the
size of the conductance itself, which has given rise to the name universal conduc­
tance fluctuations (UCF). Naively, one would expect th at if the average conductance
is (G) = No(2c2/h ), corresponding to JV0 open channels, then the fluctuations in the
number of open channels would be y/No, so th a t {SG) = (2e2/h)y/N o. This is not seen

DISORDERED MESOSCOPIC SYSTEMS

311

experimentally, the reason being th at the transmission probabilities are not indepen­
dent. The number of conducting channels in a given energy window does therefore
not follow a Poisson distribution.
For a completely random system without any symmetries, we do not expect degen­
eracies to occur. In fact one can show from RM T th at the statistical measure vanishes
when two eigenvalues coincide. Given an eigenvalue at x = 0, the probability for the
next eigenvalue to be at a; can be shown to be
P (x ) = ^arexp

,

(16.100)

for the case with time-reversal symmetry. This is called the Wigner surmise. The
fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues in a given interval is therefore far from
from the Poisson distribution, where P (x) oc exp(—x ). This “repulsion” between
eigenvalues is the physical reason for the universal behavior.
In the following we calculate the fluctuations of G using the statistical RM T for the
5-m atrix as outlined above. The fluctuation of the conductance in the case without
time-reversal symmetry is,

In this chapter we have studied the formal theory of how to calculate conductivity for
a self-averaging macroscopic sample and also the statistical properties conductance of
disordered mesoscopic systems. We determined quantum effects of impurity scattering
for both cases. We have presented a theory for ordinary conductivity as well as for
the interesting quantum correction to this result known as weak localization.
The field of quantum effects from disorder or impurity scattering is huge. Many
experiments have been performed, and much of the experimental d ata has been ex­
plained to a reasonable degree. Further development, which we have not discussed
here, is the inclusion of interaction and the combined effect of electron-electron in­
teractions and impurity scattering. For further reading and references on impurity
scattering physics see, Bergmann (1984), Lee and Ramakrishnan (1985), and Ram­
mer and Smith (1986), and for the physics of random mesoscopic systems, see Imry
(1997), Beenakker (1997), and Alhassid (2000).

GREEN’S FUNCTIONS AND PHONONS
111 this chapter, we develop and apply the G reen's function technique for free phonons
and for the electron-phonon interaction. The point of departure is the second quan­
tization formulation of the phonon problem presented in Chapter 3, in particular
the bosonic phonon creation and annihilation operators 6 ^ A and 6q A introduced in
Exp. (3.10) and (3.22) and appearing in the jellium phonon Hamiltonian Exp (3.4)
and in the lattice phonon Hamiltonian EJq. (3.23).
We first define and study the Green's functions for free phonons in both the jellium
model and the lattice model. Then we apply the Green’s function technique to the
electron-phonon interaction problem. We derive the one-electron Green’s function in
the presence of both the electron-electron and the electron-phonon interaction. We
also show how the high-frequency Einstein phonons in the free-phonon jellium model
become renormalized and become the usual low-frequency acoustic phonons once the
electron-phonon interaction is taken into account. Finally, we prove the existence of
the so-called Cooper instability of the electron gas, the phonon-induced instability
which is the origin of superconductivity.

It follows from all the Hamiltonians describing electron-phonon interactions, e.g.,
H $ % in Eq. (3.41) and
( in Eq. (3.43), th at the relevant phonon operators
to consider are not the individual phonon creation and annihilation operators, but
rather the operators v4qA and
defined as

The phonon operator .4qA can be interpreted as removing momentum q from the
phonon system either by annihilating a phonon with momentum q or by creating
one with momentum - q . W ith these prerequisites, the non-interacting phonons are
described by Hph and the electron-phonon interaction by Hei_ph «s follows:

Next, we treat the electron-phonon interaction perturbatively using the Feynman

At first sight, the two single-electron Green's functions in Eqs. (13.8) and (17.10)
seems to be quite different since W ( t ) contains four electron operators and P ( r) only
two. However, we shall now show th a t the two expressions in fact are very similar.
Since the electronic and phononic degrees of freedom decouple, the thermal average of
the integrand in the m ’th term of, say, the denominator in Eq. (17.10) can be written
as a product of a phononic and an electronic thermal average,

(17.12)

FVom Eq. (17.1) follows that only a n even number of phonon operators will lead to a
non-zero contribution in the equilibrium thermal average, so we write m = 2n. Next,
by Wick’s theorem Eq. (11.82) for boson operators, the n-particle phonon Green's
function l>ecomcs a product of n single-particle Green's functions of the form

Note how the therm al average forces the paired momenta to add up to zero. In the
final combinatorics, the prefactor ( - l ) m/m ! = l/(2 n )! of Eq. (17.10) is modified as
follows. A sign (—1)" appears from one minus sign in each of the n factors of the
form Eq. (17.13). Then a factor (2n)!/(n! n!) appears from choosing the n momenta

all possible ways to combine the remaining n momenta to the chosen ones and sym­
metrizing the pairs, all choices leading to the same result. Hence, we end up with the

17.3.1 Migdal's theorem
When the electron-phonon coupling Hei_ph is added, the question naturally arises
of whether to study the influence of the electrons on the ions before th at of the
ions on the electrons, or vice versa. The answer is provided by Migdal's theorem.
This theorem is the condensed m atter physics analogue to the well-known Born
Oppenhcimer approximation of molecular physics. The latter states th at it is a good
approximation to consider the coordinates R , of the slowly moving, heavy ions as
param eters in the Schrodinger equation for the fast-moving, light electrons, which
is then solved. In the second stage the values of R , are then changed adiahatically.
Likewise, it can be proven by phase space arguments th at renormalization of the
electron-phonon vertex is suppressed at least by a factor y /m /M ~ 10-2 , where m
and A/ are the masses of the electron and ion, respectively. We will just outline the
proof of Migdal's theorem here by studying the simplest phonon correction to the
electron-phonon vertex,

frequency u/q, and K ^PA(q,u)) -> W,RPA(9 ) for u> -> oo.
The proof builds on a self-consistency assumption. We assume th at the jellium phonons
with the high frequency fi, get renormalized by electron screening processes to be­
comes the experimentally observed acoustic phonons with low frequency u/q = v , q.
If these phonons are used, we can prove Eq. (17.22) as done in the following section,
and given this, we can prove the assumed phonon renormalization.
The important frequencies for acoustic phonons are smaller than the Debye fre­
quency u?p, thus we concentrate on phonon frequencies u/q < a>p. The diagram on
the left-hand side in Eq. (17.22) contains one phonon interaction line and two elec­
tron propagators more th an the diagram on the right-hand side. Now according
to Eq. (17.37), the typical (acoustic) phonon interaction line for low frequencies,
1*9*1 < wD, is given by —W (q)/eRPA. Furthermore, due to four-momentum conserva­
tion. the two internal electron propagators are confined within u>p to the Fermi surface.
Consequently, a phase space factor of the order W p/tp must appear in front of the
usual unrestricted contribution from two such lines, the pair-bubble of Eq. (14.22),
X0 = - d ( e F). T he ratio between the values of the two diagrams is therefore roughly
given by

where we have used Eqs. (14.23) and (3.5) at the first and third equality sign, respec­
tively. In the following we assume th at we can neglect the phonon-induced renormal­
ization of the electron-phonon vertex. We therefore study only the influence of the
electronic degrees of freedom on the bare phonon degrees of freedom. The result of
the analysis is th at the assumption for Migdal's theorem indeed is fulfilled.

Jellium phonons and the effective electron-electron interaction

In more realistic calculations involving interacting electrons, we need to consider the
sum of the pure electronic Coulomb interaction and the phonon-mediated interaction.
This combined interaction will be the basis for our analysis of the interacting electron

the electron-phonon interaction combined with the originally fully repulsive Coulomb
interaction results in an attractive effective electron-electron interaction. At high fre­

The electronic Coulomb interaction renormalizes the bare, effective electron-electron
interaction. Migdal’s theorem leads us to disregard renormalization due to phonon
processes and only to consider the most important electron processes. Since V^f(q)
is proportional to the bare Coulomb interaction, our main result of C hapter 14 tells
us that in the limit of high electron densities, these processes are given by RPA. Be­
fore we consider how the phonon propagator is renormalized by the electronic RPA,

The final form of the RPA-screened. phonon-mediated electron-electron interaction is
now obtained by combining Eqs. (17.34) and (17.36),

We now see that this renormalized propagator is identical to the free phonon prop­
agator Eq. (17.20), where the unscreened phonon frequency fi and the unscreened
Coulomb interaction W (q) have been replaced by their RPA-screened counterparts
u/q and H/ (g)/eRPA, respectively.
A further physical interpretation of this result is obtained by evaluating the expres­
sion Eq. (17.35) for wq in the static, long wavelength limit. We note from Eqs. (14.67)
and (14.24) th at in this limit eRPA(q,ign ) -> k 2J q 2 = (4kF/n a 0)/q 2. Inserting this
into Eq. (17.35) and using fcF3 = 3tt2 pg, yields the following explicit form of wq :
(17.38)
This we recognize as the Bohm-Staver expression Eq. (3.5) for the dispersion of
acoustic phonons in the jellium model. The significance of this result is th at starting
from the microscopic Hamiltonian Eq. (17.21) for the coupled electron and phonon
problem, we have used the Feynman diagram technique to show how the phonon spec­
trum gets renormalized by interacting with the electron gas. The long-range Coulomb
forces of the non-interacting problem resulted in optical jellium phonons with the high
frequency fi. By introducing th e electron-electron interaction, the Coulomb forces get
screened, and as a result the phonon dispersion gets renormalized to the usual lowfrequency acoustic dispersion oJq = vaq. In more elementary treatm ents, this spectrum
is derived by postulating short-range forces following Hooke's law. but now we have
proven it from first principles.
We end by stating the main result of this section, namely the explicit form of the
effective electron-electron interaction due to the combination of the Coulomb and the
electron-phonon interaction, see also Fig. 17.1(b),

In 1956 Cooper discovered th at the electron gas in an ordinary metal would become
unstable below a certain critical tem perature Tc due to the phonon-induced attrac­
tive nature of the effective electron-electron interaction V/c^PA(q ,u ) a t low’ frequencies.
This discovery soon lead Bardeen. Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) to develop the mi­
croscopic theory explaining superconductivity, see Chapter 18.
In this section we will derive the Cooper instability using Feynman diagrams. The
instability arises, hecause a certain class of electron-electron scattering processes,
when added coherently, yields a divergent scattering amplitude. We will first derive
this divergence, and then we will discuss its physical interpretation. The divergence
is due to repeated scattering between electron pairs occupying time-reversed states
of the form |k | ) and | - k |) . Using the four-momentum notation k = ( k , i k n ) we
consider the following pair scattering vertex A (k.p ) = M
given by the infinite

Suppressing the arguments and removing the external electron propagators, we can
recast Eq. (17.40) in the form of a Dyson equation for the pair-scattering vertex A,
(17.41)
which is equivalent to the following integral equation

H kP ) =- V ^ A( k - t)

+- E I - lSPA(i-g)] e?WS? ( -? )

(17.42)

Tb proceed, the functional form of V^*A(q, i q n ) is simplified by a physically moti­
vated assumption. First we note th at according to our analysis of the electron gas in
Chapter 14, no instabilities arise due to the pure Coulomb interaction. Thus we are
really only interested in the deviations of Vrt§ PA(q, i q n ) from HrRpA(g). According to
Eq. (17.39) and Fig. 17.1(b), VrJ PA(q, i q n ) rapidly approaches W RPA(q) for frequen­
cies larger than the given acoustic phonon frequency ojq , while it becomes attractive
instead of repulsive for frequencies below a;q. Farther, according to the Debye model
of acoustic phonons, Section 3.5, the density of phonon states, D|on(f), is propor­
tional to E2 or u?q for frequencies less than the Debye frequency fJD = v , k D and zero
otherwise, see Eq. (3.27). This means th at most of the phonons encountered have a

frequency of the order wD. It is therefore a reasonable approximation to set
= u/D.
Finally, as a last simplification, we set the interaction strength to be constant. Hence
we arrive at a model equivalent to the one used by Cooper and by BCS,

The integral equation for A(k,p ) thus only involves frequencies less than u;D. For
those frequencies A is independent of frequency, A(fc,p) = A(k. p), and the differential
equation takes the form

(17.44)

The summand on the right-hand side does not contain the external momentum k,
whence for the left-hand side we conclude th at A (k ,p ) = A(p), a result subsequently
used in the summand. Now it is furthermore evident th at the p-depcndcnce occurs
only in the A-function, hence a consistent solution is obtained by taking A(k, p) to
be a constant, which we naturally denote A. On the right-hand side of Eq. (17.44) we
can take A outside the sum, and solve for it:

We see th at at high tem peratures, i.e.^8 <r 1/ ojq, the resulting pair-interact ion A
equals the attractive pair-interaction strength V from Eq. (17.43). As T is lowered
the denominator in Eq. (17.45) can approach zero from above, which leads to an ar­
bitrarily strong or divergent pair-interaction strength A. In quantum mechanics an
infinite scattering amplitude signals a resonance, i.e., in the present case the formation
of a bound state between the time-reversed pair of electrons. But in our model, this
would then happen simultaneously for all electron pairs within a shell of thickness u D
of the Fermi surface, since the effective pair-interaction is attractive only for energy
exchanges less than u D. The conclusion is clear: if the pair-interaction strength A di­
verges for a certain critical tem perature Tc, the entire Fermi-surface becomes unstable
at th at tem perature, and a new- ground state is formed involving bound electron pairs
in time-reversed states. This instability is called the Cooper instability, and the onset
of it marks the transition from a normal metallic state to a superconducting state.
The critical tem perature T = Tc, or equivalently/3 = 0 c, for the onset of the
Cooper instability, is obtained by setting the denominator in Eq. (17.45) to zero
using 5 2 (q,i*)„) = !/(<?„ - 5 , ) and g„ = ^ ( > 1 + 3 ):

Two im portant comments can be made at this stage. T he first is th at although the
characteristic phonon energy huD is of the order 100 K, see Fig. 3.6(b), the critical
tem perature Tc for the Cooper instability is lowered to about IK by the exponential
factor. T he second comment is th at Tc is a non-analytic function of the pair-interaction
strength V , since r c(V) <x exp(—const/K ). Consequently, it is not possible to reach
the new ground state resulting from the Cooper instability by perturbation theory in
V of the normal metallic Fermi sea. These problems will be treated in some of the
exercises of this chapter and in much greater detail in the next chapter concerning
the BCS theory of superconductivity.

In this chapter we have presented the Green’s function formalism and established
the Feynman diagram rules for the free phonon system and for the electron-phonon
coupling.
One im portant example concerned the renormalization of the phonon frequencies
once the electron-phonon interaction was taking into account. The dispersion-less
frequency

of the non-interacting jellium phonons was changed into the linear phonon dispersion

for acoustic phonons in the long-wave limit.
A main result was to demonstrate the existence of the Cooper instability in the
electron gas due to electron-phonon interaction. This instability forms the starting
point of the BCS theory of ordinary superconductivity, which is the topic of the
following chapter.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity is a corner stone
in theoretical physics. Since it appeared in 1957. its influence has reached far beyond
its original scope, which was to give a coherent explanation a t the microscopic level
of a wide range of intricate and fascinating phenomena in metals at low temperature,
known as, and related to, superconductivity. Besides metallic superconductivity BCSlike theories has been used to explain superfluid 3He, the motion of nucleons in nuclei,
and the dynamics of fundamental m atter fields in high energy physics.
In this chapter, we will limit our discussion to conventional superconductivity in
metallic systems. Superconductivity was discovered in 1911 by Kamerlingh-Onnes
as the disappearance of the DC electrical resistance of mercury on cooling it be­
low a critical tem perature Tc (here Tc = 4.2 K, see Fig. 18.1(a)). In 1933 Meissner
and Ochsenfeld observed th a t metals in the superconducting state are perfect diamagnets, i.e., they expel magnetic fields completely. The following year Gorter and
Casimir postulated th at superconductivity is due to electrons in a kind of superfluid
state. In 1935 London and London extended this model to electromagnetic phenom­
ena in their famous phenomenological theory. In 1950 Frohlich in his electron-phonon
theory emphasized the importance of lattice vibrations for superconductivity, a view
supported by the independent observation by Reynolds et al. and Maxwell of the socalled isotope effect, i.e., the dependence of Tc on the ion mass. The BCS theory from
1957 was the first successful microscopic theory of superconductivity. In the following
we give a brief introduction of the theory. For deeper studies we refer the reader to
a number of classic text books on the subject such as Schrieffer (1983), de Gennes
(1999) or Tinkham (1996).
18.1 T h e C o o p e r in sta b ility
The Cooper instability has already been addressed in Section 17.5 from the point
of view of Feynman diagrams. Here we turn to the simpler wave function method to
gain further insight as to why, the electron gas in an ordinary metal becomes unstable
below a certain critical tem perature Tc.
Cooper’s analysis from 1956 of the instability of the Fermi sea due to pairformation was a precursor of the BCS theory. The basic ingredient is the combination
of a single electron state w ith its time-reversed counterpart into an electron-pair state
of zero momentum and spin. Consider the following superposition of such zero mo­
mentum spin-singlets given by

where d(EF) is the electronic density of states at the Fermi level.
A remarkable conclusion of this little model calculation is th at however weak the
attractive interaction, a pair of electrons near the Fermi surface can gain energy by

forming « Cooper pair. An intuitive explanation of the physics driving the Cooperpair formation is the following: when an electron propagates through the crystal it
attracts the positive ions and thus effectively creates a positive trace behind it. This
trace is felt by the other electrons as an attractive interaction. It turns out th at this
effective interaction is most important for electrons occupying time reversed states
and forming Cooper pairs, because in this case they can mutually take advantage of
the positive trail of each other.
In the so-called weak coupling limit, Vd(ep ) < 1, the energy gain A CP of this
bound pair state is
A cp = |Ecp|=<2i^D«q>

(18.6)

Another result of the Cooper model, which agrees with Eq. (17.47), is th at the
characteristic energy scale seems not to be
( ~ 30 meV or ~ 400 K ) as one might
naively expect, but rather wD suppressed by the exponential factor exp[—2/V d(eF)).
This ultimately explains why the critical tem peratures of conventional superconduc­
tors normally are below 10 K and not of the order of several hundred kclvin.
Finally, using the Heisenberg uncertainty relation and A E as (d E /0 p ) Ap, we
estimate in Exercise 18.2 the relatively large average distance £ between the electrons

It is commonly referred to as the coherence length of the superconductor.

18.2

T he BCS groundstate

Two physical facts are crucial input to microscopic BCS theory of superconductivity:
(i) The effective phonon-mediated electron-electron interaction Eq. (17.43) is attrac­
tive for energies
near the Fermi surface (|£k| < wj) c eF), and (ii) such an effective
interaction renders the Fermi surface unstable under the formation of Cooper pairs.
Sections 17.5 and 18.1. This led BCS to suggest the following variational wave function

being in contact with an electron reservoir allowing for fluctuations in the particle

are in fact all moving in homogeneous plane-wave states spreading all over space.
Each wave is indicated by five parallel lines. Pairs of counter-propagating electrons
hound in Cooper pairs are marked with dark gray disks th at are connected by a
dashed ellipse. These ellipses are only serving as guides to the eye. The average
size of each Cooper pair, the correlation length is much longer than the average
distance d between the electrons. Some single electrons (light gray disks, without
plane wave lines) th at have been excited out of the condensate are also shown.
The variational calculation to determine uk and vk is not along the main line of
this hook, and we will therefore not pursue it further here. However, for completeness
this analysis is carried out in Exercise 18.3 to Exercise 18.6. Instead, we will continue
with the BCS mean-field theory, but before doing th at it is important to discuss the
physical reasoning leading to the BCS groundstate.
How can one guess such a strange-looking wave function as It^ecs)? Experimental
d ata like those of Fig. 18.1 are clear signatures of a phase transition in the electronic
system. Integration of the electronic heat capacity curve Fig. 18.1(c) leads to the
surprising result th at the condensation energy gained by each electron, by undergoing
this phase transition, is a meager 10“ 8 eV (see Exercise 18.7). This value should
be compared to the binding energy o f the electrons in the Fermi liquid of about
1 eV, Eq. (2.44). The largest energy- th a t comes into play, is in fact the Debye energy
as 30 meV<€ £ p , but the smallness of this energy allows us to use Fermi liquid
theory.
Consider a homogeneous non-interacting electron gas. According to Chapter 13,
when turning on the electron-electron interaction without the phonon-mediated pairinteraction, a low-energy electronic excitation k2/2 m —fi with momentum k devel­
ops into a well-defined quasiparticle excitation of energy £k, w'hile keeping the mo­
mentum k. One then consider the influence of the phonon-mediated pair interaction
between these quasiparticles, which couples only Cooper-paired quasiparticles. This
so-called BCS Hamiltonian is

where the coupling strength V\& = —V < 0 for states of energy |£k |. | ^ | < wD and
zero otherwise as in Eq. (18.4). This effective Hamiltonian describing the interaction
between the Cooper pairs is responsible for the formation of a new groundstate th at is
qualitatively different from a Fermi liquid. The effective pair interaction destabilizes
the Fermi liquid. Cooper pairs are formed near the Fermi level, and these boson-like
quasiparticles, each with zero momentum and zero spin, form the Bose Einstein-like
condensate described by the BCS groundstate It/’ecs)-

18.3

M icroscopic BCS theory

The mean-field assumption made by BCS is th at due to the presence of many different
Cooper pairs in the groundstate |^ BCS), the pair operator c L - c t^ has a finite groundstate expectation value
^ 0, and its fluctuations around this average value
arc small. This picture is generalized to finite tem perature w-ith the understanding
that as the tem perature is raised more and more Cooper pairs are split and leave the
Cooper-pair condensate as ordinary electrons. The critical tem perature is the tem­
perature where the condensate has “evaporated” fully. Below the critical temperature
the thermodynamic average of c ^ c ^ k i is thus assumed to be non-zero.
Based on this assumption, the BCS mean-field Hamiltonian is derived from / / BCS

The new quasiparticles described by th e number operator 7 k*7 kt are called bogoliuhons after the Bogoliubov transformation spawning them. As is evident from the
new Hamiltonian (18.15) and the solution (18.14), there are no fermion excitations
possible with energy less than |A k|. The mean-field param eter A k thus provides an
energy gap denoted the superconducting gap. The existence of tills gap has a number
of important consequences.

by use of the M atsuhara Green's function technique.

BCS theory w ith M atsubara G reen’s functions

In this section, we formulate the BCS mean-field theory in terms of Matsulmra Green’s
functions. Being careful with the spin indices, we define the normal Green's function
Gn ( k ,r )
f f„ ( k ,r ) = - { r r cw (T )4 t (0 )),

(18.17)

and the anomalous Green function .Fj*(k, r ) as
_F,t ( k ,r ) = - ( r r c'_H (r)c*t (0 )).

(18.18)

As in the previous section, the BCS assumption about the existence of a Cooperpair condensate ensures the possibility for non-zero values of the anomalous Green's
function T . Once this assumption has been made, the M atsubara Green’s function
technique can be applied: Fourier transformation of the equation of motion in r-space
to ik n-space followed by M atsubara frequency summation.
From the BCS mean-field Hamiltonian tfgjcs Eq. (18.10), it is straightforward to
obtain the following equations of motion for Q and T in r-space:

Determination o f the critical temperature Tc

From Eq. (18.28) it is also possible to derive an analytical expression for the critical

T rises from T — 0. the tank-term in the num erator decreases from 1. Now, since the
left-hand side of Eq. (18.28) remains 1, it follows th at the denominator must decrease
as well, and this can only happen if |A | decreases. At some tem perature T = Te the
energy gap reaches zero, and the superconductivity disappears. Thus for T = T ~ we
have A = 0+ , and Eq. (18.28) becomes

This ratio is in good agreement with the three experimental values listed in Fig. 18.4(b).
Both the gap and the critical tem perature are reduced by the exponential factor

renormalization is what generates the new scale, uiD exp[—l/V d ( e F)]. Note that the
interaction strength appears in a non-perturbative fashion in this expression: the

is not possible by perturbation expansions to cross a phase transition line, because the
two states have no analytic connection. Once again, we see th at there is no automatic
way to predict the phase diagram of a given physical system, and one must rely on a
combination of technical skill and. most importantly, physical intuition.

Fermi level. There are no quasiparticles with an excitation energy between —|A | and
|A |. and on each side of this interval there is spike in the density of states.
It is possible to measure the peculiar BCS density of states in electron tunneling
experiments. Indeed, such experiments constitute one of the main methods to measure
the superconducting gap A, see Fig. 18.4. The main result from Section 8.4.1 regarding
tunneling currents is Eq. (8.67),

ductor s with spectral functions A im(v ,u ) and A u ( u ,u ) , respectively. The differential

possible, and by doing so we obtain the compact Nambu formalism. We shall use this

18.5.2 The Meissner effect and the London equation
Before employing the Narabu formalism in a calculation of the paramagnetic current
response of a superconductor, it is necessary to give a brief description of the Meissner
effect. In 1933 Meissner and Ochsenfeld observed that metals in the superconducting
state are perfect diamagnets, i.e., they expel magnetic fields completely as long as the
tem perature T and the external magnetic field H are not too large. For a given T the
superconducting state initially remains intact as H is increased from zero. However,
it breaks down and becomes a normal metallic state when H exceeds a critical value
H e(T). This critical field is given by the approximate expression
H „(T) = H c(0 ) [ » - £ ] ■

08.48)

where Tc is the usual critical tem perature in zero magnetic field, and where Hr(0 ) is
the critical magnetic field at zero tem perature. A superconductor with this magnetic
response is denoted a type 1 superconductor. A typical response curve is shown in
Fig. 18.1(b).
A major step towards a theoretical explanation of the Meissner effect was given
by London and London in 1935. They considered the electric current density J c (the
particle current density of Eq. (6.20) times the electron charge) being a sum of the
paramagnetic and the diamagnetic contribution,
J (r, A ) = J 7 (r, A ) —

A,
(18.49)
m
where p(r) is the electron density, and where A is the vector potential in some specific
gauge. For normal metals the paramagnetic and diamagnetic terms nearly cancel out

THE NAMBU FORMALISM OF THE BCS THEORY

337

leaving only a very weak diamagnetic response. London and London speculated that
if for some reason the superconducting wave function were rigid upon turning on the
vector potential, it would not generate a paramagnetic response different from its zero
field value
J f (r, A ) = J 7 (r, 0) = 0 .
(18.50)
The current density would then be governed by the diamagnetic term
J , (r) = _ ^ £ ) A .

(18.51)

If the density p , of superconducting electrons is smaller the p. the former is used, as
we shall derive in the next subsection, i.e.,
J .( r ) = —

m

A.

(18.52)

This is the famous London equation. T he Maxwell equation p<>J e = V x B = V x V x A
valid for static fields is inserted on the left-hand side, and choosing the transverse
gauge
V • A = 0,
(18.53)
the following equation for A is easily derived, given th at p„ is constant,
V’ A =

p A = — A.

(18.54)

where we have introduced the charactetistic London length XL,

In Exercise 18.9, we consider the specific case of a superconductor taking up the
positive half-space x > 0 with vacuum in the negative half-space x < 0. It is shown
th at a magnetic induction in th e z direction. B = B (x)ez. which has the constant
value
outside the superconductor, will decay exponentially on the length scale
inside it leaving the interior (almost) completely field-free.

Thus the Meissner effect can be explained once the rigidity of the wave function
Eq. (18.50) has been proven. This we will do using the Nambu formalism in the next
subsection.
18.5.3

The vanishing paramagnetic current response in BC S theory

Building on the linear response results of Sections 6.2 and 16.1, it is relatively sim­
ple to sot up the calculation of the paramagnetic current response in the Nambu
formalism. It is just a question of demonstrating th at in the basic formulae for the

substituted by the Nambu spinors a*. From Eq. (1.99) we find

prefactor. Moreover, the definition of the Nambu Green's function Eq. (18.44) gives
immediately
S(k,T ) = - ( r Ta k( r) 4 (0 ) ) .

(18.58)

(18-69)

can be interpreted as the density of the few quasiparticle excitations th at have left the
otherwise completely rigid Cooper-pair condensate and thereby are able to exhibit a
paramagnetic response. The form of Eq. (18.68) makes it natural to define a density
of superconducting electrons pa as
pa = p - Sp,

(18.70)

whereby we have derived the London equation (18.52).
We can calculate the density of superconducting electrons in two important limits.
Firstly, a t zero tem perature in a superconductor |A |2 > 0 yielding a strictly zero Fermi
function derivative for all values of £. In this case
P ,(T = °) = P ~ \ £

d( ( rftf) ‘ ( v ^ F i W ) = P■

(18-71)

So in an ideal superconductor, all electrons are superconducting in the sense th at
none of them yield any paramagnetic response. Secondly, for normal metals at any
tem perature, e.g., a superconductor at T > Tc, the energy gap A vanishes, and the
Fermi function derivative is well-approximated by the usual delta function,
*>,(A = 0 ) = p - |

J°°d t £ i ( ( ) i({ - ef ) = .

(18.72)

So in a normal metal, all electrons yield a fully compensating paramagnetic response.
In genera], according to the BCS theory, as tem perature rises two things happen:
the superconducting gap A is lowered and the Fermi function derivative broadens.
Therefore the integral begins to pick up some weight, and Sp is no longer strictly
zero and consequently the normal paramagnetic response begins to set in; however,
note th a t as long as it is smaller than the diamagnetic one, the wave function is rigid
enough to exhibit the Meissner effect.
If we return to the example given in Eq. (18.56) and Exercise 18.9, the solutions
inside the superconductor (x > 0 ) for the magnetic induction, the vector potential,
and the current density are

this current is flowing in the groundstate at thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e.Tat min­
imal free energy. This current must therefore be dissipationless, and it is one example
of the remarkable property of superconductors: the lack of electrical resistivity. This
we will discuss further in the following sections.
18.6

G auge sym m etry breaking and zero resistiv ity

In Chapter 4, the relation between phase transitions and broken symmetries was dis­
cussed. In this section, we apply these concepts for the transition from a normal to
a superconducting state. It turns out th at the relevant broken symm etry for super­
conductors is the global gauge symmetry. This is apparent already from the London
equation 18.52, which is clearly not gauge invariant. The way to understand this is
that the superconducting order param eter is linked to th e gauge choice, which tve
discuss next.
18.6.1

Gauge transformations

Consider first non-interacting electrons in a magnetic field given by the vector postential A. The Hamiltonian is then given by Eq. (1.90),
/ * * S w ( j V r + eA ) V ( r ) .

(18.74)

It is seen by direct substitution th at upon the transformation
A ->
♦„(!■)

A = A + V *,

(18.75a)

-v # w(r) = ¥ ff(r) e~te*,

(18.75b)

both the Hamiltonian H A as well as the magnetic field B remain invariant. Such a
transformation is denoted a gauge transformation, or more specifically a U (l) gauge
transformation since the phase factor exp(—i e \ ) represents a unitary scalar transfor­
mation. Here, the phase factor has been multiplied on ^ 0 (r), but it would have been
the same in the k-space representation for c ^ .
In the case of the Meissner effect, the London equation (18.52) is not gauge invari­
ant. If we perform the transformation Eq. (18.75a) the physical current J r changes.
But we were careful to state th at the calculation was explicitly for the transverse part
of A fulfilling V • A = 0. However, the longitudinal part V \ appearing in A by the
gauge transformation affects the order param eter A,

(18.76)

This result indicates th at the Meissner-effect calculation should have been done selfconsistently with the longitudinal component of the vector potential appearing in the
order parameter. Such a calculation corresponds to a generalization of the random
phase approximation with pair correlation taken into account. We will not carry this
analysis through in this hook, but instead refer the reader to the book by Schrieffer

(1983). Fortunately, however, by performing this calculation the expression presented
above is not significantly altered.
We have seen th at gauge transformations will alter the superconducting order
param eter A. Even in the simplest case of zero magnetic field and a constant \
(yielding V * = 0 ) the order param eter is modified, because if —ex = ip = const.,
then
A = 0 -» A = 0,

(18.77a)
(18.77b)

The appearance of the pair-field A in the BCS Hamiltonian (18.10) seems to break
the global gauge symmetry of the original Hamiltonian, thus indicating th at this
is the relevant symmetry to consider in connection with the superconducting plume
transition.
18.6.2

Broken gauge symmetry and dissipationless current

Above the critical tem perature the Hamiltonian is invariant under a global gauge
transformation. Below Tc the symm etry is broken, cf. the definition in Section 4.4,
and the order param eter together with its phase acquire a finite value, which means
th at a specific "gauge angle”
has been picked. This global phase coherence is a
combination of the intricate superposition and correlations in Eqs. (18.8) and (18.11).
An analogous situation is realized in a ferromagnetic system. For tem peratures
above the Curie tem perature all spins can be rotated by the same constant angle
without changing the Hamiltonian, which therefore has a global SO(3) symmetry.
When cooling below the Curie tem perature the SO(3) symmetry is broken, because
the expectation value of the spin (S) is not invariant under rotation. Similarly, phase
rotations ciiange the superconducting order parameter, which is of the form (cvcU‘).
Schematically the analogies between superconductors and ferromagnetic systems are
shown in Table 18.1.
While it is clear why the finite expectation (S) gives a magnetization in the case of
a ferromagnetic system, it is not so clear why broken symmetry in the superconducting
case leads to a phase without resistance. We have argued th at the superconducting

cannot have any measurable effect, because all expectation values are given by the
absolute square of the wave function. However, phase gradients can have an effect.
For example, let us assume th a t the phase y?(r) of the superconducting order pa­
ram eter depends on position, but th at it varies so slowly th at
r) changes substan­
tially only over macroscopic distances. For any non-superconducting system it would
not make sense to talk about a quantum mechanical phase difference over macroscopic
distances, simply because quantum coherence is destroyed over large distances. For
the superconducting case it is different, because the phase is a thermodynamic vari­
able, I.e., it is given by the value th at minimizes the free energy. In fact, it turns out
that if the phase variable is slowly varying, the system chooses to carry a current in
order to minimize the free energy. Alternatively, one can say th a t if a current is forced
through the superconductor it responds by tilting the phase of the order parameter,
thus maintaining the superconducting order. It turns out th a t the current and the
phase variable are related as
(J) = ^ - V v ,

(18.78)

where p, is the density of electrons in participating in the condensed state.
Since the superconducting system can minimize its energy by carrying a current
even in thermodynamical equilibrium, this current must be dissipationlcss, l>ecause
maintaining thermodynamical equilibrium means maintaining constant entropy, and
constant entropy means no heat exchange. Of course, the condensation energy is
decreased compared to the state with zero current, but as long as this cost is smaller
than the alternative, which is to go out of the superconducting state, the currentcarrying state is chosen. The critical current is reached when the energies are equal,
and for higher currents the superconductor goes into the normal state.
Furthermore, given this framework it should also be clear th at the appearance of
the excitation gap is not the reason for the superconductivity itself. The superconduc­
tivity is, as we have argued, due to the lack of gauge invariance, and in fact, gapless
superconductors do exist.
Naturally, the above arguments are only qualitative and in order to derive the
existence of a supercurrent, Le., a current without voltage, more rigorously we discuss
in the following section the so-called Josephson effect. The Josephson supercurrent
can be viewed as a discrete and extreme version of Eq. (18.78). because it occurs
between two superconductors connected by an insulator.

T h e J o s e p h s o n effect

When two superconductors are separated by a thin insulating barrier, a so-called
tunnel junction being either vacuum or some oxide, it is still possible to observe
a supercurrent flowing between them. This is known as the Josephson effect. We
will use a method based on a derivative of the free energy to emphasize th at the
supercurrent is an equilibrium quantity, and not, as for normal conductors, a non­
equilibrium dissipative current.
The electron operators on each side of the barrier are denoted ck<r and
re­
spectively. Both the c and the / system are superconducting BCS systems. The tun-

The calculated Josephson current is a dc response to a constant difference in
the superconducting phases surrounding the insulating barrier. There exists also an

S u m m a ry a n d o u tlo o k

Superconductivity is a result of condensation of pairs of electrons, and hence it is a
macroscopic quantum state. This situation is similar to Bose Einstein condensation,
where a finite fraction of the total number of particles occupies the zero momentum
state.
The Bose Einstein condensate is often described in following way: the occupation
of the zero momentum state is N0 — (o^Oq), but if this state is macroscopically
occupied it is fair to say th at removing a single particle from the condensate does
not change the macroscopic state and hence (ao) j 1 0 , which is in fact the order
param eter for Bose-Einstein condensation .66 For the superconductor, the condensate
consists of pairs of electrons and in analogy with the Bose-Einstein condensate, the
phase transition occurs when the expectation value {c_k.j.ckf) is non-zero. In this
chapter we have described the mean-field theory for this transition and, furthermore,
discussed a number of consequences of the superconducting phase. We have seen th at
a gap appears in the density of states as result of the BCS theory, but in fact this
is not always the case, because in some cases the gap vanishes at special points in
the reciprocal space. We have also emphasized the importance of breaking of global
gauge symmetry. The broken symmetry has two important consequences: the Meissner
effect and the possibility for the superconductor to sustain a supercurrent. This is
demonstrated in detail for the so-called Josephson effect, where a supercurrent runs
between separated superconductors with zero voltage bias.
The physics of superconductors is covered in a number of classical textbooks such
as Schrieffer (1983), de Gennes (1999), and Tinkham (1996). In recent years, also the
physics of mesoscopic and nanoscale superconductors have been exploited and new
and interesting phenomena have been identified.

ID ELECTRON GASES AND LUTT1NGER LIQUIDS
The ID interacting electron gas is very different from its higher dimensional coun­
terparts. T he main difference being the breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in ID. In
Chapter 15 we saw th at the main achievement of the Fermi liquid theory is th at it
enables us to picture the elementary' excitations in terms of quasiparticles. As we shall
sec in this chapter, the quasiparticle excitations are in ID electron systems replaced
by the Luttinger Tbmonaga excitations, a sort of density waves, hating a completely
different nature. The corresponding electron liquid is denoted the Luttinger liquid.
It is not merely an academic exercise to study the interacting ID electron gas.
There are several systems, listed below, in condensed m atter physicB, where interacting
Fermions confined to ID can be investigated and thus motivating our present study
of the difference between ID and 3D physics.
In recent years, the concept of Luttinger liquids has been of much interest because
of the possibility to observe the unusual properties of ID electron gases in artificially
fabricated nanostructures and in carbon nanotubes. This activity was also influenced
by the study of how a single impurity can lead to drastic changes of the transport
properties of an ID system (Fisher and Glazman 1997), which is in contrast to the
usual understanding of phase coherent transport in mesoscopic systems as we saw in
Chapter 7.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a short presentation of some of the
key points, for more comprehensive overview of Luttinger-liquid theory and its many
applications we refer the reader to the review papers listed at the end of the chapter.

19.1

W hat is a L uttinger liquid?

In ID the so-called Luttinger liquid, which was conjectured by Haldane (Haldane
1981), replaces the Fermi liquid as a generic many-particle state. In the Luttinger
liquid the elementary excitations are very different from those of free electrons, and
an attem pt to define quasiparticles as in the 3D case fails.
The general Luttinger liquid picture is in nature similar to the Fermi liquid pic­
ture. In both pictures, the low-energy excitations of a many-particle ground state
characterize the systems, but for Luttinger liquids the low-energy excitations are not
quasiparticles, but rather the density waves given by Luttinger-Tbmonaga model (see
Sections 19.3 and 19.5). It is often the case th at the simple form of the effective
low-energy Hamiltonian of this model (see Eq. (19.52c)) remains the same, even if
we include more complicated interactions such as spin-flip backscattcring (see Sec­
tion 19.9), hence the generic name “Luttinger liquid” . T h at such processes often are
unimportant at low' energies, can be shown by a careful renormalization-group treat­
ment of the more general Hamiltonian. The discussion of this is, however, outside the
scope of the present book.

Naturally, there is no true ID system in nature. However, there are a number of
physical systems in condensed m atter physics th at are well described by ID models.
The crucial requirement is th at the quantum confinement in the two perpendicular
directions is strong enough, so th at, at low energies, one can disregard all quantum
levels except a single ID mode. Below we list some systems th at h aw been assigned
properties characteristic of ID metals. More references can be found in the review
papers listed at the end of this chapter.
19.2.1

Example: Carbon Nanotubes

Experimentally, one of the most promising candidates for a detailed study o f ID
physics is the carbon nanotube (see Section 2.3.3). In the Tomonaga Luttinger model
a linear dispersion relation is assumed, see Eq. (19.15). In metallic carbon nanotubes
this an unusually good approximation, because the dispersion relation, which is in­
herited from the semi-metallic graphene, is linear over a large energy range of order
several hundred meV (see, e.g., (Saito et al. 1998) for details). For example, tunnel­
ing d ata on nanotubes show' power-law tunneling density of states similar to the one
derived in Section 19.8 (Egger et al. 2 0 0 1 ).
19.2.2

Example: semiconductor wires

Another example of quasi ID system, where also signatures of the famous spin charge
separation has been observed is thin wires made in semiconductor heterostructures.
More precisely, the so-called cleaved edge overgrowth systems, where tunneling ex­
periments between two wires have been argued to show the spin-charge separation
characteristic of Luttinger liquids (Tserkovnyak et al. 2003).
19.2.3

Example: quasi ID materials

A number of organic crystals and other crystals have very large anisotropies, where the
conduction along one crystal direction is much larger than along the two others. One
example is the so-called Bechgaard salts. It has been argued th at the optical response
of such systems can indeed be described by the power laws that are characteristic of
Luttingpr-liquids (Giamarchi 2003).
19.2.4

Example: Edge states in the fractional quantum Hall effect

The last example is the ID edge states of a 2D electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic
field in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state. It turns out th at one can formulate
a theory for the ID edge states, which is similar to the Luttinger liquid model th at
we shall consider in Sections 19.4 and 19.5. The theory of Luttinger liquids in FQH
states was suggested by Wen (1992, 2004). In Exercise 19.6, we go through a simplistic
version of this theory.
19.3

A first look a t t h e th e o r y o f in te r a c tin g e le c tro n s in ID

In the RPA treatm ent of plasmons in dimensions higher th an one, we saw previously
in Fig. 14.2 th at the plasmon excitation was clearly separated from the electron-hole
pair excitations at low wave numbers. This fact made the plasmon excitation stable,

A FIRST LOOK AT THE THEORY OF INTERACTING ELECTRONS IN ID

349

since it could not decay by emitting electron-hole pairs. In dimensions 2 and 3 the
plasmon dispersion has the form U7p,(g) <x q<3 -<b /2. see Exercise 14.3. The dispersion
relation for a classical ID system of charges with short-ranged interaction is wpl oc q.
Since the plasmon dispersion is linear it is not as obvious as in 2D and 3D th at we can
make a clear distinction between collective excitations and single particle excitations.
In Eq. (8.79) and Section 14.5 we have seen th at the ability of an electron to
dissipate energy is given by the imaginary part of the polarizability. From Eq. (8.79)
and the RPA result in Eq. (14.66) the conductivity a becomes
(19.1)
where V(q) is the Fourier transformed interaction, and where X o ( q ,u > ) is the usual
Lindhard function, but now both expressions are given in ID. The imaginary part in
Eq. (19.1) can be rewritten as

Mi - f t U]

M

,19-2)

where eRPA = 1 - V ( q ) x § { q > v ) and where we have defined the dynamical structure
factor S(q,u)).ar Excitations are thus possible whenever S is different from zero. Now
there are two distinct ways th at S can become non-zero: (a) if the real part of e is
zero and the imaginary part is infinitely small, or («»') if the imaginary p art of Xa Is
finite. Excitations of type (»), the plasmons, are given by
S( 9 ,u ) = r f ( B * [ £ ( ,,* ,) ] ) .

(19.3)

We can find the dielectric function in RPA, and in the long wavelength limit we get

Now the Fourier transform of the ID interaction V(q) depends on the details of the
wavcfunction, since for the strictly ID case

we encounter a divergence. However, this divergence will be cut-off by the finite extent
of the wavefunction in the transverse directions, and in order not to worry about these07

Next, we discuss the excitations of type ( « ), the electron-hole excitations. For these
we express S (q ,u ) by the polarization function,

First, we note that for small q, excitations can only occur on the straight line given
by \u)\ = vpq in q - u? space. This is contrast to the 2D and 3D cases, where there was
an area below the line u> = Upq, see Fig. 19.1. More importantly, the weight of the
single-particle excitations in Eq. (19.9) is proportional to frequency. Thus low-energy
behavior cannot be described by a single-particle picture. The standard arguments
for having well defined quasiparticles separated from the collective modes is simply
not correct. In fact, the low-energy excitations that are left are the plasmons, which
precisely is also the finding of the exact solution based on bosonization to be presented
below in Section 19.5. Therefore in this respect, RPA is exact when it comes to
describing the low-energy excitations in ID.

the case in ID. Also, ID is special in th at a t low frequencies, it only allows for
a narrow band of single particle excitations near q = 0 (forward scattering) and
q = 2kp (backward scattering).
19.3.2

The lifetime o f the “quasiparticles n in ID

If we had some hope of justifying Fermi liquid theory in ID, this is finally destroyed
by the following consideration. In Chapter 15 on Fermi liquids, we saw th at the decayrate of quasiparticles vanishes as energy squared. Now, let us try the same calculation
in ID starting from Eq. (15.65)

x [ na( &+, - &) + np(St+,)] [np(&. ) - n p ( f r . , ) ] .

(19.10)

We exclude q = 0 from the sum in accordance with the usual definition of the electronelectron interaction in a positive background. We can perform the k' integral by first
using the delta function, which is

“911)
Firom this expression we see th at the final state of the particle with momentum k is
the state Ar\ and consequently momentum and energy conserving scattering between
two particles in ID can only occur if the particles exchange momentum. The phase
space for scattering in ID is thus very' limited, unlike in 3D where the integration over
possible initial and final states leads to the relation 1 /rjt ex ££, see Eq. (15.68), which
means th at the lifetime in 3D diverges at the Fermi energy, in ID, the lifetime turns
out to be energy independent, which renders the usual Fermi liquid argument invalid.
The term corresponding to q = 0 does not contribute to Eq. (19.10). From the
other term we obtain after using the relation Eq. (10.19a) th at

The factor njr(£<.+9) [1 —n f (&+g)] requires th a t for k close to the Fermi points, also
k q must be close to one of the Fermi points, meaning th at q is either close to

respectively. If we perform the integral and take the lim it of small temperature,

From the above considerations on the life time and the excitation spectrum we
are thus forced to conclude th a t Fermi liquid theory does not work in ID. The very
concept of a quasiparticle has to be discarded. In w hat follows, we will see th a t this
interesting situation reveals a new type of quantum liquid, where we have to learn
how to deal with interacting many-body systems in a different way.

19.4

Our starting point in this section will be the Hamiltonian for a gas of interacting
spinless electrons. The spinful case is briefly dealt with in Section 19.9. We will map
the ID system to the so-called Tomonaga-Luttinger model by the interaction in terms
of density operators for the left- and right-moving particles. This rearrangement is
possible under the assumption th a t the physics is restricted to energies much lower
than the Fermi energy, and therefore only small momenta exchanges are included.
Next, we show th at the density operators for left- and right-moving particles obey
a boson like algebra, or to be specific a so-called Kac-M oody algebra. For the K acMoody algebra to be realized, we must assume th at the occupation of the electrons
with energies of order the Fermi energy is not affected by the interactions. The small
param eter of the theory is thus the ratio of the interaction strength to the Fermi
energy. However, it does not mean th at we are making a perturbation theory in this
small param eter, and the end result will in fact be non-perturbative in the interaction
strengths.
The next key point is to realize th at the usual kinetic energy of free electrons can
be written as a bilinear form of density operators and as a consequence, the entire
Hamiltonian is now quadratic in density operators. This last step is made possible
by the additional assumption that for the energies of interests, it suffices to linearize
the dispersion relation near the Fermi energy'. Now, by a simple transformation into
usual boson operators with canonical commutations, we will thus have “bosonized”
the model and in fact solved it.
19.4.1

Consider a ID system of spinless interacting electrons. The Hamiltonian for the system
is

The interaction V(q) depends on the physical situation, bu t we assume th at it has
well-defined values for forward scattering (q near zero) and backscattering (q » ± 2 fcp ).
Furthermore, as in Eq. (2.34) we use a prime in the (/-summation sign to indicate that
we have taken out the Hartree term corresponding to q = 0.
The basic idea of the so-called Tomonaga model is to linearize the dispersion
relation ek . The linearized single-particle dispersion is
=

(19.15)

which is illustrated in Fig. 19.2 for a parabolic dispersion efc. Thus, the Tomonaga
model has a finite energy (or momentum) cut-off given by the range where the linear
dispersion is applicable. Another model is the Luttinger model, which assumes an
infinite bandwidth with linear dispersion for all real values of and th at the left- and
right-moving branches represent two different species of electrons. This rather artificial
model is nevertheless useful, because it can be solved exactly. The solution is found
by the boson representation to be introduced in Section 19.5. and this remarkable fact
makes it therefore sometimes advantageous to work with the model. Here, we choose
to include the cut-offs explicitly and refer to the resulting low-energy Hamiltonian
as the Tbmonaga Luttinger model. However, when deriving the Ibm onaga Luttinger
liquid from a ‘Teal" interacting electron gas, wre must invoke a set of approximations
and clever ways of parameterizing the interaction.
The next step is to separate the electrons in two species: the right-moving electrons
with k > 0 and the left-moving ones with k < 0. The electron operator is therefore

around the Fermi points and can be ignored a t small energies compared to the Fermi
energy. The six conserving terms can be grouped in different ways, which will be done
in the following three subsections.

for an “ideal" point-like interaction there is no effect of the interaction, which is in
agreement with the Pauli exclusion principle th at two particles are never at the same
position.
It is worthwhile to stress th at as indicated in Eq. (19.20) the left- and right-moving
charge densities are defined without subscripts L, R on the fermion operators c and c*.
The difference between the two definitions is a question of whether the right and leftmoving electrons are regarded as two different species of particles or not. In practice
the distinction m atters only when k 4- q ~ 0. but since the im portant k'a lie near the
Fermi level, and we have assumed q <§: k r , we can use either a t our convenience.

Intra-branch interaction and charge conservation

defined on the same branch

Above, we replaced the interaction function with two parameters V (0) and V(2ArF),
and we want to make a similar approximation for the intra-branch interaction. We
sta rt by noting th at the intra-branch interaction becomes ambiguous, if V(q) is re­
placed by a constant Vo. Tb see th at we collect the operators in Eq. (19.22) in two
different ways. The first wray is simply to identify the sums over k and k' with two
density operators,

where we omit the constant shift of the chemical potential one gets when commuting
ck+qR wfth ck’R- The second way is to group ck+qR with c£,R instead, and then write
the interaction as

If we then shift q as q -* - q - k + k '. we arrive a t Eq. (19.23) but with the opposite
sign. The ambiguity we h a w encountered is a consequence of the artificial linearization
of the dispersion and the separation into left and right movers. We therefore need
a physical principle to fix the value of the param eter VJ,. Above, we saw th at in
accordance with the Pauli principle, the inter-branch interaction vanishes for shortrange interaction. Since the intra-branch interaction must also have this property,
we can expect that V0 should be proportional to V(0) — V (2kP) (sec also Starykh
et al. (1999)). This is indeed seen to be correct when we use the requirement that
the model must conserve charge or, in other words, th at the continuity equation
Qtp + 0TJ = 0 does not change form. This is ensured if
[/W fo )]= 0 ,

(19.25)

where p(q) Is the density operator. The density operator for long wavelength excita­
tions is the sum of excitations in the left or the right movers (at T = 0),
P i 9) = P l ( q ) + Pr(9)*

for 9 « 0-

(19.26)

The condition (19.25) fixes Vo, because we see th at if Vo = V(0) — V(2kp ), the
combined intra- and inter-branch interaction terms become
Him = -

- V (2kp)] [pL(q) + pR{q)] [P l ( - 9) + pR( -q )] ,

(19.27)

and this docs indeed commute w ith the density operator in Eq. (19.26). To verify this
we must, however, first find the commutation relation between pL(q) and pL{ -q ) and
similarly for right movers. This is done in Section 19.5, and using these results the
commutator in Eq. (19.25) is indeed seen to be zero. The interaction in Eq. (19.27)
is the final form of the interaction that we are going to use in the following.
19.4.4

Umkiapp processes in the half-filled band case

We note in passing th at there is one additional term, which is important for electrons
in a half-filled Bloch band, namely th a t corresponding to the so-called umkiapp pro­
cess.00 This process comes about because the state a t k P is equivalent to the state at
kp + G, where G a reciprocal lattice vector, see Eq. (2.8). For the half-filled band case
’"Umkiapp" is the German word for "abrupt turn around"

357

BOSONIZATION OF THE TOMONAGA MODEL HAMILTONIAN

k y = it/2a, and therefore the scattering processes k y —►k y + 2k y and k y —
♦ —k y are

equivalent, and there is then one more way to group the interaction, namely as
H ff =

+ ( * « I )-

(19-28)

In order to h aw k “ being right going and k ' — q being left going, q must be near 2 k y .
Since also k is near + kF the last operator has k + q close to 3k y . For a nearly half
filled periodic band 3JtF is equivalent to —k F and if we shift q - * 2k y + q and insert
a reciprocal lattice vector G we arrive at

where q is now small and G should be close to -3fcF. This term only exists if the
band is close to half-filled, and we will not consider it. However when present, it is
indeed important and can change the ground state of the system.

A most remarkable aspect of the ID Hamiltonian derived above is th at it can be
expressed as a bilinear form of bosonic operators. Once this is done it is trivially
solved and we have the astonishing outcome: an “exact” solution of an interacting
many-particle problem.
19.5.1

Derivation o f the bosonized. Hamiltonian

First, let us study the commutation relation of the left- and right-mowr densities.
Consider, e.g.,

- q > k >0

The last crucial approximation was to assume th at for small k (much smaller than
k y ) , we can replace the operator nj, by its expectation value for the non-interacting
problem, i.e., n* = 1 for k <c k F. The basic assumption is here th at the interactions
only modify the properties near the Fermi surface. Similarly we obtain

It is now clear th at the interaction part of the Hamiltonian can be expressed in
terms of the density operators pn and pL. In the hope th at we can express the kinetic

(1936)

which shows that the eigenmodes of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are described by

(1937)

This together with Eqs. (19.34a) and (19.34c) and the fact th at the density operators
commute with the number operator, shows th at the free-electron part can be written
as
Ho = J ^ ' E M -« > P n (9 > + f t.( « K H r > ] +C(1V),
(1938)
** q>0
where C (N ) is a constant that only depends on the total number of particles.
In the derivations, we have used the filled Fermi sea |JV,0) with N electrons as the
reference state. It can be shown th at any many-particle state with fixed numt>er of
electrons can be readied by acting on the reference state with linear combinations of
density operators p L and p r . In other words, states of the form f ( p R . p L ) \ N ) constitute
a complete set within the subspace with a given number of particles. The proof is to
show th at the partition function is the same in the two representations (Haldane 1981;
von Delft and Schoeller 1998) since if they were not equal, states would be missing.
The Hamiltonian does not bring us out of the subspace with constant N and therefore
the Hamiltonian in Eq. (19.38) correctly describes excitation energies within Hilbert
spaces of fixed number of particles.
All we have left to do now' is to find the constant C (N ). It is simply given by the
energy of a filled non-interacting Fermi sea, and it is easily found to be
C ( lfL, N r ) = - F (-V,2 + f lg ) =

(W2 + J 3) ,

(19.39)

where we have allowed for different number of electrons in the two brandies and
defined N as the total number of electrons and J as the current, J = N r —N i . Both
N and J are of course conserved quantities.

Real space representation

Often a real space formulation of the bosonized Tomonaga-Luttinger model is easier
to work with because of its more appealing form. The real space representation is
obtained by the following Fourier transforms pR L {z:) of the density operators pR-L(q),

again removing the g = 0 term originating from the constant background. Strictly
speaking, this Fourier transform is not well-defined in the Tomonaga model, because
for large values of |?| the bottom of the band is reached. Therefore. Eq. (19.46) should
be viewed as valid at long wave lengths only. i.e.. th at contributions from large |q>|
must not be important. Alternatively, one can simply define the left- and right-mover
dispersion relations to be linear for all values of q, i.e., also below the bottom of the
hands. This is then equivalent to the Luttinger model. For now we simply work with
Eq. (19.46) as the definition of the Fourier transform of left- and right-mover densities,
but as we go on we must remember th at the theory is to be thought of as an effective
theory for the long wavelength excitations only.

These relations are sometimes referred to as a Kac-Moody algebra, while the non-zero

we have seen, consequences of the separation of electrons into two different species
with a momentum cut-off (or infinite bands for the Luttinger model).

By combining Eqs. (19.53) and (19.49) we obtain the continuity equation. dr J +/> = 0,
where the current has been identified as J = v f (p r —Pl ) and the total charge density
as p = pR + Pl . The Hamilton equations Eq. (19.53) leads to the wave equation
tj>- vj-d^d) — 0 , with dispersion relation u = vpq.
The model in Eq. (19.52c) includes interactions, and it gives (g v/v p )d TJ + p = 0,
which means th at the physical current is (g v /v p ) J . Going back to the definition, we
see th a t Qv / vf = 1, and the interacting model thus conserves charge as it should. The
velocity for the plasmon waves has however been renormalized by the interactions,
which is seen from the corresponding wave equation: 4>= 0 , and which is in
accordance with the dispersion relation in Eq. (19.45). The interaction param eter is
directly related to the compressibility n of the system, which is defined as

According to the Hamiltonian Eq. (19.52c), a density change gives rise to an energy
change SE = nv(Sp)2/2g, and hence k = g /n v. The ratio g v p /v is 1/(1 -f Vi/[irt>p)),

ELECTRON OPERATORS IN BOSONIZED FORM

which is less than unity for repulsive interactions, and in this case the compressibility
is thus decreased by interactions, as we expect physically.
Finally, we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian Eq. (19.52c) in analog)’ with the
phonon problem of Section 3.3. First, we introduce the Fourier transforms <t>k and Pk
of d>(x) and P (x), respectively, which gives

Electron operators in bosonized form

W hat have we achieved so far, is to identify the charge-density eigenmodes of the
interacting model and, therefore, the collective excitations. W hat we have not yet
found is the one-particle properties, e.g., the local density of states as being probed
by tunneling experiments and other transport experiments. To this end, we need an
explicit form of the single electron operator in terms of boson operators, w'hich would
allow for the computation of the single-electron Green's functions and higher order
correlation functions. This problem was solved by Luther and Peschel, by M attis,
and later Haldane (1981). Here, we shall construct such an operator by using the
requirements th at it must obey anti-commutation relations, and th at it creates a
displacement of the charge density by one electron charge (see Fig. 19.4).
The bosonized form of the Hamiltonian Eq. (19.40a) refers to a representation of
the Fock space, where a given state is represented by a filled Fermi sea with a given
number of left- and right-moving electrons, \NR, N L), plus some linear combination

ivy,

(19.60)

where O is some function. This representation of the Fock space should be used to
construct a Fermion operator. First we split the electron field operator into left- and
right-moving components

= - 4 E c^ kx = 4

e

c^ e<fc* + 4 E c^

kx = ® «(*)+**(*)■

(19.61)
So a field operator
operating on some state, does two things: it decreases the
number of electrons by one and it displaces the boson configuration for th at particular
state. Let us introduce the “ladder operators” th at change the number of electrons
by one:
V r W * N l ) = IN r - 1, N l ),

uU n r ,N l ) =

IN r + 1, N l ),

(19.62)

and similarly for the set (UL, [/[).
The other operation of the electron field operator is to displace the boson modes
corresponding to the sudden disappearance of one electron charge. How this works is
most easily seen by looking a t its commutator with the density operator
[ • i W if tl t* ') ]

(19.63)

where 7] indicates the electron species. In our case rj labels left- or right-moving par­
ticles, if = L ,R .
We note th at since the density operator has been expressed as a boson operator,
we can try to express the single electron operator in the form of a displacement
operator cB, where B is some linear function of the boson operator. We then know

ELECTRON OPERATORS IN BOSONIZED FORM

from Exercise 19.1(a) th at the commutation with the operator for the density has a
form similar to Eq. (19.63):
[««,*,(*-)] =

(19.64)

The form of the p-operators at Eqs. (19.47a) and (19.47b) then suggests that
* ,(* ) =

(19.65b)

Here the upper sign goes with the t] = R and the lower with r] = L. We have taken
special care of the constant part of the density which gives the factor ? ik Fx in the
definition of ^ ( x ) .
Let us check th a t this, in fact, works:
[*„(*), f t , ^ ) ] = A [ e- a -<*>,p,(l')]C=f“ - 't l , ,

=±2*ie-'WJ’j y [±5J5<(*-*')]
= S ( x - x l) e - i6^ l ) ,

(19.67)

So we conclude that the commutator, in fact, evaluates to the expected result. Fur­
thermore. we see that the anti-commutation relation also comes out correctly
* ,(* ) * ,< * ') = t , ( x ') * , ( i ) c x p ( - [«(*),«(*')])
= - * ,( « ') * , < * ) .

(19.68)

because by using the Kac-M oody algebra relations. Eqs. (19.47a) and (19.47b), we
obtain for the commutator appearing in the exponential.70
(0f,(x), M x ')l = ± i?r sign(x' - x).

(19.69)

The same argument applies to {#♦ (x), ^ ( x ') } at different positions, x ^ x '. At
equal positions x = x ', the anticomm utator is not well-defined unless we put in a
finite momentum cut-off in the Fourier transform of the fields

L kfto *
In order to determine the relationship between the cut-off a and the proportionality
constant in Eq. (19.65a), we compute the anti-commutation relation for x -4 x'. In
70In order to derive this wo must symmetrize the derivative of the delta function as 0m6(x —x1) =
fOK6(x - x ') - - Qm<i(x - x ') or alternatively be more careful and work with the explicit momentum
cut-off Introduced below.

ID ELECTRON GASES AND LUTTINGER LIQUIDS

order to do this carefully, we separate the annihilation and creation operators in the
product
(a;'), so th at the annihilation operators stand to the right of the
creation operators. W hy this is sensible is explained below. Here, we write out the

ID ELECTRON GASES AND LUTTINGER LIQUIDS

W hat Eq. (19.84) expresses is th at creation or annihilation of a localized charge
involves physics on two length scales. The usual de Broglie wavelength of a particle
moving with the Fermi momentum gives the e±,krX factor, while the exponent with
the boson fields causes a shake-up of a lot of low-energy collective modes of the
electron gas. The length scale for the latter process depends on the energy involved,
and Ls given by q~l « v p / e . where e is the available energy. The decomposition of
the single electron operator into an infinite number of low lying states is what gives
rise to many of the peculiar properties of ID metals.

19.7

G reen’s functions

Above we saw how the Hamiltonian of interacting electrons was diagonalized by a
transformation into a bilinear form of boson operators. However, we had to pay the
price th at the single electron operators became rather complicated objects in terms
of these bosons. Nevertheless, calculations with these single particle operators are
possible, because they are nothing bu t coherent states of bosons. We will now compute
the G reen's function analytically using this form for the single-particle operators. This
result is rather remarkable: it is rare th at we are able to compute a Green's function for
a complicated interacting many-body problem. The non-trivial form of the Green's
function is shown to have interesting consequences for. e.g., the tunneling current
which is considered in the next section.
We now consider the retarded Green’s function C R(x ,t). According to Eq. (8.32),
we can write
G r (x , t) = G (t) [G>(x, t) - G< (x, t)] ,
(19.86)
where

G>(x,() = -i(* (x ,i)* t(o ,0 ))
«< -i(#*(* ,t)® },(0,0)) -i{ * i(x ,t)> l'i(0 ,0 ))
= G g (x ,l) + G J (x ,(),

(19.87)

and similarly
C < (x ,() = i < V ( 0 ,0 ) * ( i ,! ) ) a G % ( x , t ) + G f { x , t ) .

(19.88)

Now we insert the electron operator expressed in term s of the bosons from Section 19.6
G £ (x ,Q =

(19.89)
exp ( - iy/n[ - 0(x, t) + 4>(x, t)] ) exp ( i ^ r [ —0(0,0) + 4>(0,0 )]))•

Note th at the ladder operators U do not play a role, because they only change the
number of particles. This has no effect, since the expectation value in Eq. (19.89) is
independent of the number of particles in the reference state.

MEASURING LOCAL DENSITY OF STATES BY TUNNELING

Next, we utilize a very nice property of free bosons, namely th at the second-order
cumulant expansion is exact, i.e.,
= exp ( i {A) - i (B ) - i (A 2) - - ( B 2) + ( /IB )) ,

(19.80)

if A and D are linear in the boson operators. Because the linear terms vanish. {A) —
{B) = 0, and the equal tim e products are reduced as {[A(t))2) = {(j4(0)]2), this nice
formula Rives for our Green’s function

M easuring local density of states by tunneling

Some of the most convincing observations of Luttinger liquid behavior are the mea­
surements of power laws in the tunneling density of Btates. In many of these ex­
periments the tunneling setup is as illustrated in Fig. 19.5. Tunneling between two

conducting systems was discussed in Section 8.4.1, where also the tunneling Hamilto­
nian was introduced. For tunneling into ID wires we will use a real-space formulation
of the tunneling Hamiltonian,
H r = J ^ d i [ d x [ T (i,r ) » S ( i) » j( r ) + * * ( r) * a(i)] ,

(19.97)

where the ^-integral runs over the ID metal, and the r-integral is defined by the
tip. The tunnel m atrix element T (x , r) describes the amplitude for tunneling between
positions x and r. Now we follow the same line of arguments as in Section 8.4.1, where
the tunneling m atrix element is assumed to be small and therefore one can use linear
response theory in H t , and we find

/= 2H s J

J^dTdi' J^dx lb '\T (x,l)]'T ( t/ y )

( # 2(r ',t')* J (r ,t))) .

(19.98)

The voltage dependence is pulled out similarly to Eq. (8.71) and furthermore, using
the fact th at the tip can be described as a metal we use a diagonal basis for the tip
field operators: 4'2 (f) =
c*,^,(r). We then find an expression similar to Eq. (8.72),
I = 2 Re J
x [G f (x t, x 't')G £ (v , t' — t) — G f ( x t , x't')G% (1/, t' —t ) ] ,

with
Finally, we specialize to the case where the spatial extent of the tip and hence
the spatial variations of the tunneling m atrix element is small compared with typical
length scales, over which the ID Green’s function changes, i.e., smaller than the
wavelength of charge fluctuations: max{eV, k T } /v . In this case, we set x = x ', and
furthermore, we choose x — 0. The lesser and greater Green's functions can now he
expressed in terms of the spectral functions using Eq. (8.51). The same steps that
lead to Eq. (8.74) now give us
1 = 1 f d u C (u ) [ » f ( » + V ) - n F ( u ) ] i/(w),

where we have defined an energy-dependent conductance G(w), which characterizes
the tip, and a normalized density of states for the ID system t'(w). If the tip is a simple
metal, and we are a t low voltages and low temperatures, it is a good approximation to
neglect the energy dependence of G(w), and we see th at tunneling spectrum directly
measures the density of state of th e ID metal. The spectral function -4(0, uj) is given
by

found there that

At the end of the calculation we are supposed to take the limit a —» 0. It is, however,
not clear how to do that in the expression above. Therefore we have to take one
step back and consider how the cut-off was introduced. The cut-off a , appearing in
Eqs. (19.106) and (19.107), was a mathematical cut-off, which was included in order
to make the single-particle operators behave correctly. But we should also include
a physical cut-off, saying th at the interactions are not important for large energies,
which we do by giving g a momentum dependence,

such th at for large k-values the non-interacting case is recovered. Instead of doing the

play the role of the momentum cut-off and replace a with A;” 1 in Eq. (19.111), i.e.,
the tunneling density of states becomes

where constants that only depend on the tunneling m atrix element, the high-energy
cut-off. and the renormalized velocity have been omitted. The different power laws
for the different tunneling setups indeed seem to be supported by experimental ob­
servations on carbon nanotubes.
In Exercise 19.4, a similar characteristic is derived for a somewhat different situ­
ation, namely a transmission line model. The exercise thus shows an analogy with a
ID metal and ID electromagnetic system.
19.9 L u ttin g e r liq u id w ith s p in
So far we have only discussed the spinless case. However the Bpin-full in also very
interesting but of course a bit more complicated. Let us here briefly discuss what
happens in the case with spin. First of all, it is clear that the unperturbed Hamiltonian
can be written in the same bu t with an additional sum over spin index, a,

Ho = - j r - ^ 2 [PRo(q)PRa{-q) + PLo(q)PLa(-q)]-

(19.116)

oq

The interaction can now be written as products of density operators along the same
lines as for the spinless case. However, there is one thing we must ensure, namely
th at the SU(2) rotational invariance of the spin sector is fulfilled by the Ixwonized
interaction. The SU(2) symmetry implies th at the Hamiltonian is invariant under the
rotation
< V ^ E ( u W ‘V .
(W 117)

where U is a unitary m atrix. As the most simple example of a
“bosonized" intera
th at satisfies this symmetry and at the same type has the same structure as the
interaction we derived in the spinless case, we take
= z E E (&’» • ( « ) +
qita aa‘

[pRa’{-q ) + PLo’( - , ) ] ) .

(19.118)

There is however one type of scattering which cannot be cast into the form of products
of density operators. This is backscattering terms between electrons with opposite
spin, i.e., a term like
X ) c* t 4 l clUc£T'
(19.119)
One can argue with renormalization group m ethods th at this term is not important
for repulsive interactions. This is however beyond the scope of this book, and for now
we will simply neglect it.

ID ELECTRON GASES AND LUTTINGER LIQUIDS

Now the Hamiltonian separates into charge and spin degrees of freedom, because
if one introduces charge and spin densities.
P = Pi + PT>

° = PI ~ P h

(19.120)

the Hamiltonian reduces to
[ p n (- i? ) M i) + P t(i)p r.(-q ) + °n {
(19.121a)
HiM = I S

([* * (* )+ f t W ] [p«(—9) + Pt-( - ? ) ] ) •

(19.121b)

The Hamiltonian has indeed two decoupled parts describing spin and charge, respec­
tively. Many of the calculations are now similar to the spinless case: one can find the
commutation relations between p and a operators to be similar to the spinless counter
parts, and hence introduce boson operators in the same way. Also single electron op­
erators can be constructed straight forwardly bu t now being functions of both spin
and charge bosons. As a consequence the tunneling density will have similar form, as
we saw in the previous section, i.e., a power law dependence, the only difference being
different powers.
The important lesson we learn here is th at spin and charge degrees of freedom
live independent lives, which is known as charge and spin separation. This unusual
feature has no simple counterpart in higher dimensions.

S u m m a ry a n d o u tlo o k

We have discussed the behavior of ID metals. In ID the Fermi liquid theory that was
argued to lx* realized in 3D systems, does not apply. This fact became clear when we
looked a t the lifetime in ID. and we saw th at it does not diverge sufficiently rapidly
a t the Fermi surface. Furthermore, the collective excitations were very different from
the 3D counterparts. The dispersion relation was. in fact, in RPA shown to be linear
in q. rather than having a gap. The RPA result indeed agrees with the Tomonaga
Luttingcr model, where we found th at the elementary excitations all had the form of
plasmon modes, leaving no room for electron-hole pair excitations.
The Tomonaga Luttinger model was solvable, because the interactions and the
kinetic energy both could be written as a quadratic forms of the left- and right-mover
densities, and th at these densities obeyed boson-like commutation relations. In fact,
the Hamiltonian for the ID electron gas could be written in form of a Hamiltonian of
an clastic medium,
(19.122)
where g is an effective interaction parameter, which smaller is than unity for repulsive
interactions and larger than one for attractive interactions. The derivative of the field

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

<t>gives the density of electrons, while its conjugated momentum n describes the
current in electron gas.
The bosonic formulation of the Hamiltonian allows us to solve for the cigenmodes
and eigenenergies 0 /(9 ) =
of the charge density modes. However, in order to de­
scribe single-particle Green’s functions it was necessary to express the single-electron
operator in terms of the bosons, i.e., to the fermion operators as a function of boson
operator. This was indeed possible and the result of this analysis was th at the leftand right-mover field operators became

J

(19.123)

This form of the electron operator was used to find the single-particle Green’s func­
tions and the tunneling density of states. The result of this analysis was th at the
tunneling current exhibits a power law dependence on the voltage. Such power laws
are indeed a very common feature of Luttinger liquids and similar field theories.
This concludes our treatm ent of ID physics, which is a interesting field of m ath­
ematical physics in itself, and the present chapter is in many respect only an ap­
petizer to this vast field. For the interested we refer to, e.g., the books by Gogolin
et at. (1998) and Giamarchi (2003), or the reviews by Solyum (1970), von Delft and
Schocller (1998), Fisher and Glazman (1997), Voit (1995), Egger et al. (2001), and

the tunneling between atom and metal, described by Eq. (9.25). It is therefore a good

tunneling theory for the current between tip and atom.

R SJ model o f a Josephson junction: th e ac Josephson effect
Consider a Josephson junction as in Section 18.7, however now with a finite bias
voltage applied across the junction. One can still have a dc Josephson current / j
running given by Eq. (18.88)
I j = I c sin <f>.
(E.18.16)
This relation Is also known as the first Josephson relation.
The finite voltage changes the energy and hence the phase of the electrons in the
two superconductors of the junction. We can simply include this phase change in the
time dependence of by the following substitution
C(1)

(E. 18.19)

or, after reintroducing h,

which is called the second Josephson relation.
The second Josephson relation adds interesting dynamics to the Josephson junc­
tion because of the intrinsic frequency 2eV/tL One can measure this frequency by
applying external R.F radiation to the junction. The Josephson junction thus acts as
a voltage to frequency converter, which has m any applications.
Now we look at the current-voltage characteristic of a Josephson junction in the
resistively shunted unction (RSJ) model. The current is carried by two kinds of elec­
trons: those th at are paired and those th at are not. The pair current is described by
the Josephson relations while the normal current is supposed to be given by Ohm's
law'.
Consider a current biased setup, i.e. a junction with a fixed current I. This current
is made up by the sum of the supercurrent and the normal current. Thus

The following three expressions are useful for further studies of the ID transmission
line model of the Luttinger liquid.
(a) Let O and B be two operators which commutator [O, B] is a c-number. Prove
the commutator for displacement operator e B
[O, eB] = [O, B] eB.

Hint: consider the function /(A ) = e~XBOeXB and differentiate with respect to A.
(b) Prove the Baker-Hausdorff formula:
eA+B = eAeBe-i[A,B\

(E.19.2)

Hint: use the analogy with the time-evolution operator in the interaction picture, e.g.
by writing U ( t ) = e~rAeT^A+B) and differentiate with respect to r and then ju st keep
going.
(c) Consider coherent states of the form exp(g <4)|0). where g is some constant.
Show that the overlap between two such states is given by
( o l e '- e ^ I l O ^ e x p I s / ) .

Hint: you can do it by expanding the exponentials and by showing th at a " (a*)" |0) =

To get a better physical understanding of the physics of Luttinger liquids, we look
a t a simpler and maybe more familiar case: a line of inductors and capacitors. We
will quantize this transmission line and see th a t it has a lot in common with the

Luttinger liquid. The quantum fluctuations of transmission lines was an important
piece of physics that went into the understanding of Coulomb blockade in single tunnel
junction, now known as the environment theory of Coulomb blockade.72
As shown in the following figure, a transmission line consists of a series of inductors
and capacitors. If we go to a continuum description, we have a wire with a distributed
capacitance (capacitance per unit length) c and an inductance per unit length. I.

where j(x ) is the local current and p(x) is the local charge density at position x. The
first part corresponds to the kinetic energy while the later is the potential energy. The
current and the charge densities are linked together through the continuity equation:
p + dxj = 0,

(E. 19.5)

and if we define a displacement density, u, given by p = dx u, then from the conti­
nuity equation the current is j = —u. Let us now write down a Lagrangian for our

In this exercise we work with a simplistic version of the Luttinger liquid theory of
fractional quantum Hall edge states (Wen 1992. 2004).
As briefly mentioned in Eq. (1.5) and Fig. 1.1 the eigenstates ifrnk of the free
electrons in the x y plane subjected to a strong perpendicular magnetic field B are
given by
M * , y ) = e‘kxM y - M 2),

where n is the integer Landau level index, I = y /h /e B is the magnetic length, and k
is the wavenumber which also gives the center k P of the harmonic oscillator funct ions
<}>„. Each Landau level is degenerate, with density of states per area given by 1/2 n (2.
The filling, u, per available state is called the filling fraction
u = pQ2 n P ,

(E.19.18)

where fa is the electron density per area. In terms of v the classical Hall resistance is
given by

Near special filling fractions, such as v = 1/3, th e Hall resistance shows a plateau as
a function of v due to properties of the many-body state, but this is not the issue
here. We focus entirely on the edges. Only states close to the edges are influenced by
the confining potential, and there they acquire a energy dispersion

Vconiiv) is the confining potential th at is flat in the bulk of the sample but bends
upwards at the edge, and vp = V't^ of(j/)/eB is the drift velocity, which is non-zero
only for states near the edge.
Following the analysis of Section 19.5 our analysis of the fractional Hall state
edges begins by studying the density operator for electrons near the edge. Consider
the density near the, say, right edge

The special nature of the FQH groundstate only enters in the last approximation: it
would not make sense to replace the occupation (n t) by unity, but it should rather
be the occupation of the FQH bulk state, Le., (n t) = v. FYom this observation now
follows some interesting consequences.
In analogy with the treatm ent in Section 19.5.3 introduce the fields <£(x) and
P (x) through Fourier transformations of the density operators.

and show t hat in order to preserve the canonical commutation relations, an additional
factor of \ / v must be included in the definition of P.
(c) The second basic assumption is th at the energy of edge excitations is quadratic
in charge density. In other words, we assume th at there is no gap for charge fluctu­
ations near the edge, and then we expand the energy in density fluctuations. Show
in analogy with Section 19.5 th at this this results in a bosonic Hamiltonian with a
structure similar to th a t of the Luttinger liquid Hamiltonian:

where V p is some velocity of the edge states, related to the drift velocity V p .

(d ) In order to probe this interesting structure of the edge states, tunneling ex­
periments were suggested by Wen and has been performed recently. To calculate the
tunneling density of states we need a single electron operator ♦(a:) , and as in Sec­
tion 19.6 we must demand th a t [p(x), ^(x ')] = ♦ (* )$ (* —*?)■ Show th at because of
the unusual commutation relation Eq. (E. 19.22) 4»(x) takes the form
