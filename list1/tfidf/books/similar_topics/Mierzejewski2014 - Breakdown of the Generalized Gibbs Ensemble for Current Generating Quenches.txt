We establish a relation between two hallmarks of integrable systems: the relaxation towards the
generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) and the dissipationless charge transport. We show that the former one is
possible only if the so-called Mazur bound on the charge stiffness is saturated by local conserved quantities.
As an example we show how a non-GGE steady state with a current can be generated in the onedimensional model of interacting spinless fermions with a flux quench. Moreover, an extended GGE
involving the quasilocal conserved quantities can be formulated for this case.

It is commonly accepted that in generic macroscopic
systems the long-time averages of local observables
coincide with the results for the statistical Gibbs ensemble
[1–4] and are uniquely determined by few parameters
related to conserved quantities, in particular the system’s
energy and particle number. Due to the presence of
macroscopic number of conserved quantities such a simple
scenario is not applicable to integrable systems [5–7].
However, there is a large and still growing evidence
that relaxation in the latter systems is consistent with
the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) [8–12], where
the density matrix is determined not only by the
Hamiltonian H and particle number N but also by other
local conserved
quantities Qi , i.e., ρGGE ∼ exp ½−βðH−
P
μNÞ − i λi Qi .
In this Letter we focus on the relaxation dynamics of one
of the most studied integrable models: the model of
interacting spinless fermions, being equivalent to the
anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) model for which the set
of Qi has been established [13,14]. We show that ρGGE as
generated only by local integrals of motion Qi doesn’t
exhaust all generic stationary states in the metallic (easy
plane) regime. Instead, there are cases for which one should
lift the requirement of locality of the conserved quantities
and allow also for quasilocal integrals of motion [15,16]. In
this Letter we call them non-GGE states, however we stress
that these states can be viewed also as “extended GGE,”
where the extension concerns the locality of operators.
Such operators have the parity opposite to local ones Qi .
We identify one of such quasilocal quantities as the timeaveraged particle current operator and we construct as well
as verify it explicitly.
It has been well recognized that integrable systems in
spite of interaction reveal anomalous transport properties at
finite inverse temperatures β ¼ 1=T, e.g., the dissipationless particle current. This property is manifested by a
nonvanishing charge stiffness Dðβ < ∞Þ [17–20], which in
0031-9007=14=113(2)=020602(5)

turn is bounded from below by the local conservation laws
via the Mazur bound [19,21]. The dissipationless transport
and the relaxation towards GGE are probably the most
prominent hallmarks of integrability, still they have been
studied independently of each other so far. While it has
been clear that in certain regimes the standard Mazur bound
with only local Qi does not exhaust the phenomenon of
dissipationless transport and Dðβ < ∞Þ > 0 [19] we show
in this Letter that GGE should be extended by taking into
account quasilocal conserved quantities of different parity,
in particular the time-averaged current, which saturate
Dðβ → ∞Þ within the Mazur bound.
We study a prototype one-dimensional (1D) model of
interacting particles, the tight-binding model of spinless
fermions on L sites at half filling (with N ¼ L=2 particles)
and with periodic boundary conditions [22–25],

where nj ¼ c†j cj , n~ j ¼ nj − 1=2, th is the hopping integral
and V is the repulsive interaction on nearest neighbors. The
model (1) is equivalent to the anisotropic Heisenberg
(XXZ) model with the exchange interaction 2th and the
anisotropy parameter Δ ¼ V=2th. However, we stay within
the fermionic representation, where the phase ϕðtÞ has a
clear physical meaning: it represents the time-dependent
magnetic flux which induces the electric field
FðtÞ ¼ −∂ t ϕðtÞ. Further on we use ℏ ¼ kB ¼ 1 and units
in which th ¼ 1. We consider here the metallic (easy–
plane) regime V < 2 (Δ < 1) where the system exhibits a
ballistic particle (spin) transport at T > 0 [18–20,26–33].
The Mazur lower bound on DðT > 0Þ vanishes at half
filling [19,34] and it remains a challenging problem to
explain why DðT > 0Þ stays nonzero. Here, we explore the
relations between the conservation laws, the origin of finite
DðT > 0Þ and the relaxation towards a non-GGE state and

show that a finite DðT > 0Þ emerges within an extended
GGE state. InPour studies we use the standard particle
current J ¼ j ðieiϕðtÞ c†jþ1 cj þ H:c:Þ as well a less
common currentPwith a correlated hopping to next-nearest
neighbors J0 ¼ j ðie2iϕðtÞ c†jþ2 n~ jþ1 cj þ H:c:Þ. The central
point in our reasoning is the particle-hole (parity) transformation,
ci → ð−1Þi c†i ;

ð2Þ

which (for ϕ ¼ 0) does not alter the Hamiltonian H → H
(at half filling) nor the local conserved quantities Qi → Qi
[19] but reverses the currents J → −J and J0 → −J0 , hence
JðJ 0 Þ and Qi have different parities.
We start with numerical studies of a quantum quench
which generates a non-GGE steady state. We consider a
system which for t < 0 is either in the ground state or in the
equilibrium canonical or microcanonical state [35]. In the
latter case we generate a state ρð0Þ ¼ jΨð0ÞihΨð0Þj for
the target energy E0 ¼ hΨð0ÞjHð0ÞjΨð0Þi and with a small
energy uncertainty δ2 E0 ¼ hΨð0Þj½Hð0Þ − E0 2 jΨð0Þi as
discussed in Refs. [36,37]. The time evolution shown in
Fig. 1 has been obtained by the Lanczos propagation
method [36–38].
At t ¼ 0 the magnetic flux is suddenly decreased from
the initial value ϕð0Þ ¼ ϕ0 > 0 to ϕðt > 0Þ ¼ 0. Such a
quench is equivalent to a pulse of the electric field FðtÞ ¼
ϕ0 δðtÞ hence it generates the particle current ≠ 0. As shown
in Fig. 1 this quench induces also hJ0 ðtÞi ≠ 0; however, the
latter quantity increases gradually in contrast to the
instantaneous generation of hJðt > 0Þi. Both currents reach
for t → ∞ finite steady values, clearly visible in Fig. 1,
being the signature of dissipationless transport. Still the
residual values hJi ≠ 0 and hJ 0 i ≠ 0 cannot be explained
within the GGE scenario since TrfρGGE Jg ¼
TrfρGGE J0 g ¼ 0 due to different symmetries under particle–hole transformation at half filling [19].
The first objective of this Letter is to establish the
symmetry decomposed time-averaged density matrix

missing in ρGGE . At this stage it is instructive to recall
the linear-response (LR) results

where the optical conductivity σðωÞ consists of the regular

of flux induces an electric field FðωÞ ¼ ϕ0 =ð2πÞ and the
regular (dissipative) part of conductivity becomes irrelevant
in the long-time regime. Then we get within the LR, i.e., for
ϕ0 ≪ 1,
lim hJðtÞi ¼ 2LDϕ0 :

t→∞

ð5Þ

An important message following from LR, Eq. (5), is that
the non-GGE component of the density matrix has to
contain contributions that are linear in ϕ0 and, therefore,
can be singled out already within the first-order perturbation expansion in ϕ0 . The unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 ¼
Hðt < 0Þ is given by Eq. (1) with ϕðtÞ replaced by ϕ0,
while the perturbation reads H 0 ðtÞ ¼ HðtÞ − H0 ¼
ðϕ0 − ϕðtÞÞJ 0 , where J0 ¼ Jðt < 0Þ, so that H0 ðt > 0Þ ¼
ϕ0 J0 . For the sake of clarity all quantities obtained with
the flux ϕ0 will be marked with a label 0, in particular the
eigenvalues Em0 and the eigenvectors jm0i of H0 . The
degeneracy of energy levels plays an important role and
should not be neglected. Hence, we diagonalize the current
operator in each subspace spanned by degenerate eigenstates and take the eigenvectors of J as the basis vectors of
this subspace, i.e., hmjJjni ∝ δmn if Em ¼ En (within a
subspace only).

We should also take into account the change of current

J ¼ Jðt > 0Þ ¼ J0 − ϕ0 H k0 ;

We now turn to the question of whether ρ̄ is compatible
with ρGGE and the answer is clearly negative. A necessary
and a sufficient condition for such compatibility, to leading
order in the quench ϕ0 , would be a decomposition in terms

which is the Mazur bound on charge stiffness at T → ∞
[see Eq. (14)]. Since this inequality turns into equality for
GGE states, so should the Mazur bound. In other words
relaxation towards GGE is possible provided the Mazur
bound saturates the charge stiffness.This relation holds for
an arbitrary filling N=L. In particular for N=L ¼ 1=2 one
finds TrðQi JÞ ¼ 0 due to the symmetry (2); hence, the rhs
of (18) vanishes, and our quenched dynamics does not relax
to GGE.
As has been shown in Refs. [15,16], another set of
nonlocal, but quasilocal conserved, Hermitian operators
fQðφÞg exists for a dense set of commensurate interactions
Δ ¼ cosðπl=mÞ, with l; m integers, densely covering the
range jVj < 2. They are all odd under (2), QðφÞ → −QðφÞ.
Quasilocality implies linear extensivity TrfQðφÞ2 g=
N ∝ L, similarly as for the local conserved operators
Qi , while TrfJQðφÞg=ðLN Þ ¼ const, making them suitable for implementing the Mazur bound. For
Δ ¼ cosðπ=mÞ for which T → ∞ limit of the Bethe ansatz
result [26] is available it has been shown [16] to agree
precisely with the Mazur bound, so one may conjecture that
the latter is now indeed saturated. Hence our argument
(15)–(18) can be used to argue that the complete timeaveraged current can be expressed in terms of an integral,

The above analytical results are nicely corroborated by
exact numerical simulations in finite systems shown in
Fig. 2. From Eq. (23) one finds that the ratio of two currents
should be given as Trfρ̄J0 g=Trfρ̄Jg ¼ V=4 as confirmed in
Fig. 2(b). Here, the tiny deviations from 1=4 are presumably due to oversimplified (linear or parabolic) fitting
functions. Furthermore, one can define the stiffness with
respect to current J 0 as D0 ¼ hβJ̄0 2 i=ð2LÞ. Formula (23)
immediately implies that J̄0 ¼ ðV=4ÞJ̄, and so the two
stiffnesses should have a simple ratio D0 =D ¼ ðV=4Þ2 [see
Fig. 2(a)].
In conclusion, we have proposed a class of global
quantum quench dynamics of integrable spin chains for
which the state at asymptotic times does not relax to GGE.
We argue that, at least for weak quenches where linear
response theory is applicable, the validity of GGE ensemble
is in one-to-one correspondence with the saturation of the
Mazur bound expressed in terms of strictly local conserved
operators. However, if one extends the GGE ensemble by
including the quasilocal conserved operators from the
opposite parity sector—having linearly extensive HilbertSchmidt norm—then the latter can be used to describe
exactly the steady state density operator after the quench.
Our theory has been demonstrated in the one-dimensional
model of interacting spinless fermions (XXZ spin model)
within the metallic regime.

It should be noted that our results are expected to have
further implications on other relevant quantities of integrable systems besides the charge stiffness.
The fluxP
quench-induced steady current hJ̄i ¼ 2 k sinðkÞhn̄k i ≠ 0
is reflected into the fermion momentum-distribution function hn̄k i, which also does not comply to the standard GGE.
The latter quantity is the one typically measured in coldatom experiments [41,42] and most frequently studied in
connection with the GGE concept [5,8,10]. The inclusion
of the quasilocal conserved quantity J̄ fully fixes the steady
state hn̄k i within our quench protocol via extended GGE
form Eq. (11). It is still tempting to construct and consider
further (presumably conserved) quantities from the same
polarity sector, which would fix this and related quantities
for an arbitrary quench.
