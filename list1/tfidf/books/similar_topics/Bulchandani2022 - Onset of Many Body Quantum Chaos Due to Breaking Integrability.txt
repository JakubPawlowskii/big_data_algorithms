Integrable quantum systems of finite size are generically robust against weak enough integrabilitybreaking perturbations, but become quantum chaotic and thermalizing if the integrability-breaking
is strong enough. We argue that the onset of quantum chaos can be described as a Fock-space
delocalization process, with the eigenstates of the integrable system being taken as the ‚ÄúFock states‚Äù.
The integrability-breaking perturbation introduces hopping in this Fock space, and chaos sets in
when this hopping delocalizes the many-body eigenstates in this space. Depending on the range
of the dominant Fock-space hopping, delocalization can occur either through a crossover, or via a
transition that becomes sharp in the appropriate large-system dynamic limit. In either case, the
perturbation strength at the onset of chaos scales to zero in the usual thermodynamic limit, with
a size-dependence that we estimate analytically and compute numerically for a few specific models.
We also identify two intermediate finite-size-dependent regimes: There is generally an intermediate
nonchaotic regime in which integrability is broken strongly enough to produce some system-wide
many-body resonances but not enough to thermalize the system. In spatially extended systems (but
not in quantum dots) there is also a crossover or transition between chaotic regimes where the ratio
of the system size to the mean free path of the quasiparticles of the integrable system is small versus
large compared to unity.

result is to perturbation strengths

INTRODUCTION

Thresholds to many-body chaos

For much of the 20th century, there was a widespread
belief that arbitrarily weak perturbations of classical integrable systems lead to chaos. It was therefore a great
surprise when Kolmogorov, Arnol‚Äôd and Moser (KAM)
showed that sufficiently weak perturbations of classical
integrable systems preserve integrability within an appreciable fraction of phase space. In particular, they found
that a perturbation whose strength scales with a small
parameter  preserves integrable dynamics in a fraction
1 ‚àí O(1/2 ) of the phase space, that is characterized by
the persistence of so-called KAM tori1 .
At a first encounter, this result sits uneasily with the
dogma of ergodicity on energy surfaces that underpins
much of statistical physics. If integrability truly is robust
to perturbations, how can ergodicity arise generically in
large systems? It is believed that the answer to this question lies in the finite-size scaling of the threshold perturbation strength c (N ) at which KAM tori break down,
where N denotes the number of degrees of freedom of the
system. In particular, conventional wisdom states that
c (N ) ‚Üí 0 as N ‚Üí ‚àû.
Unfortunately, the problem of analysing perturbed integrable systems at large N is so difficult that there is
little analytical understanding of the threshold c (N ),
even for classical systems2,3 . The original KAM approach
is guaranteed to converge for a range of perturbation
strengths2

for systems with short-range interactions, but there is no
expectation that this result is optimal2 .
This paper studies the quantum mechanical analogue
of the problem described above. Specifically, we propose
a theoretical model for the critical perturbation strength
c (N ) at which perturbed quantum integrable systems
give way to chaos. On the one hand, this task is complicated by the fact that there is no analogue of the KAM
theory for quantum systems, which partly reflects some
technical difficulties in robustly defining integrability and
chaos for quantum systems4,5 . On the other hand, the
problem of finding c (N ) is in some ways more tractable
for quantum systems, first because a relatively simple
theory of ‚ÄúFock-space delocalization‚Äù seems to describe
the onset of chaos in perturbed non-interacting quantum
systems6 , and second because it is possible to simulate
numerically the entire spectrum of small systems of spins
or fermions, which is never the case for continuous classical systems. We now summarize the physical motivation
for understanding quantum integrability breaking, and
the theoretical model that we will use to describe it.

Quantum integrability breaking: overview

There are numerous many-body quantum systems of
interest that are in some sense nearly integrable. This
can be because the system is very close to an integrable

2
system but has a weak integrability-breaking perturbation. Or it can be because the system is near a ground
state that features an emergent integrability, even if the
same system‚Äôs dynamics are far from integrable at higher
energies. Although the study of quantum integrability
remained largely theoretical for decades, present-day experimental capabilities for the preparation and control
of many-body quantum systems are sufficiently advanced
that several recent experiments have observed unambiguous signatures of integrable dynamics and transport in
such systems7‚Äì12 .
At the same time, it is well known that if one perturbs
a nonlocalized quantum integrable system, such as a spin
chain, with an integrability-breaking perturbation of any
non-zero strength, the system thermalizes in the conventional thermodynamic limit, in which all local couplings
are kept constant as the system size is taken to infinity13‚Äì15 . This can be true even if the perturbation acts
only locally at a single point14,16‚Äì19 . Many studies of
systems with weakly-broken integrability are numerical
or experimental studies of finite systems, with substantial finite size effects. Thus we are not only interested
in infinite systems. To better understand the observable
behavior in finite size systems, it is helpful to consider
large system limits that are different from the standard
thermodynamic limit.
The distinction between integrability and chaos is not
an equilibrium thermodynamic distinction; instead, it is
a distinction in the system‚Äôs dynamics. Thus in order
to understand more about how an integrability-breaking
perturbation to an integrable system leads to chaos, particularly in finite-size systems, below we focus our attention on the range of perturbation strengths that is relevant to the onset of chaos. This requires scaling down
the integrability-breaking perturbation as one takes the
large-system limit so that the system remains close to
the onset of chaos for all sizes‚Äîwe call this limiting procedure a dynamic limit. In such a dynamic limit, the
integrability-breaking perturbation has no effect on the
thermodynamics of the system but qualitatively alters its
dynamics. A textbook example of this is the very weak
interactions in a dilute gas that are crucial for its equilibration but do not affect its equation of state. A single
system may have multiple dynamic limits, depending on
the particular dynamical phenomenon of interest.
A pioneering investigation of such ‚Äúdynamic limits‚Äù was performed by Altshuler, Gefen, Kamenev
and Levitov6 (AGKL), who examined the integrabilitybreaking ‚Äúmany-body delocalization‚Äù transition that occurs when weak interactions are added to a quantum dot
containing many noninteracting electrons. In that work,
as well as subsequent work on various other many-body
localized (MBL) models20‚Äì23 , it was argued that sharp
phase transitions can happen in the dynamic limit: i.e.,
transitions between ‚Äúphases‚Äù with identical thermodynamic properties, but sharply different dynamics in the
long-time limit. (Note that the one-dimensional MBL
transition24 is also such a dynamical transition, albeit

one that happens in the conventional thermodynamic
limit.) However, there has been relatively little work
from this perspective on integrability-breaking in conventionally integrable systems, which are solvable via
the Bethe ansatz and have stable ballistically propagating quasiparticles. Much of the work on integrabilitybreaking in Bethe-solvable systems has addressed transport, quench dynamics, etc. in the conventional thermodynamic limit8,25‚Äì34 . In this limit, the system is chaotic
on timescales longer than the mean free time of the quasiparticles. Much less is known about the behavior in the
dynamic limit relevant for the onset of chaos: even the
basic question of whether chaos sets in at a perturbation strength that is polynomially or exponentially weak
in the system size remains unsettled, with numerical evidence for both scalings35‚Äì39 ; as we will argue below, both
behaviors do occur, depending on the specific model under consideration.

C.

Quantum integrability breaking: a theoretical
model

In the present work, we study finite-size systems and
these dynamic limits systematically by exploiting an
analogy between perturbed integrable systems and Fockspace delocalization in quantum dots (as discussed by
AGKL). Each eigenstate of an integrable system can be
uniquely labeled by the values of extensively many local
conserved quantities in that eigenstate, or equivalently
by an extensive set of quantum numbers. Heuristically,
the existence of such labeling schemes suggests a natural metric on state space, according to which states
with ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù labels are ‚Äúnear‚Äù one another. For example, in the AGKL analysis of a quantum dot, eigenstates
can be labeled by bit-strings corresponding to whether
each single-particle orbital is occupied or not. These bitstrings can be pictured as the vertices of a hypercube,
and the natural metric is the Hamming distance between
bit-strings.
The key observation that justifies the reduction of local
integrable systems to effectively zero-dimensional Fockspace localization is that the thermalization rate at the
onset of chaos is close to the Heisenberg energy (i.e., exponentially small in the system‚Äôs volume), and is thus
much slower than the time it takes ballistic quasiparticles
to traverse the system. Thus, on timescales relevant to
the onset of chaos a finite weakly-perturbed integrable
system with nonlocalized quasiparticles is essentially a
zero-dimensional quantum dot. This observation places
such local integrable systems (like the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain) and all-to-all integrable systems (like Gaudin
magnets) on an equal footing, and allows us to identify
two possible main scenarios for the onset of chaos:
1. The integrability-breaking perturbation induces
sufficiently short-range hopping in Fock space.
When this scenario holds, the onset of chaos is a

3

2. The hopping is instead sufficiently long-range in
Fock space that highly nonlocal processes dominate near the onset of chaos. We present evidence
that this scenario occurs in XXZ spin chains subject to a class of perturbations that mix parity sectors and thus break the mapping to Jordan-Wigner
fermions. When this scenario holds, the onset of
chaos remains a crossover even in the large-system
dynamic limit, and the perturbation strength at
this crossover is exponentially small in N .
We emphasize that this observation would not be valid
for many-body localized systems with short-range couplings, which instead require a theoretical treatment
that accounts for the distribution of resonances in real
space24,40 . However, for systems with non-localized
quasiparticles, this observation implies that the physics
of integrability breaking can be understood directly from
the matrix elements of the perturbation in the unperturbed basis, which define the amplitudes for hopping in
Fock space and therefore determine whether there is a
transition or a crossover to chaos.
Unfortunately, even though these matrix elements (the
so-called ‚Äúform factors‚Äù of local operators41‚Äì43 ) can be
efficiently computed in some specific models, their general statistical properties have not been explored in detail
(though see Ref.44 ). Therefore, our exploration of the onset of chaos will be largely limited to small systems that
are amenable to exact diagonalization (though we will
briefly discuss one case where larger system sizes are attainable, see Sec. IV.) Using Bethe ansatz technology to
extend our analysis to larger system sizes is a desirable
goal for future work.
For the same reason, we do not consider perturbations
of integrable systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces in this work, such as conformal field theories and
integrable bosonic theories like the Lieb-Liniger model.
In the former case, we note that the large degeneracy of
the unperturbed integrable system implies that integrability is already broken by processes that occur at first
order in perturbation theory , as discussed recently in the
literature45 , so that a detailed analysis of the high-order
processes leading to Fock-space delocalization is not necessary for understanding the onset of chaos. For perturbed integrable field theories with non-degenerate spectra (for example, perturbed, non-degenerate free bosons)

transition in the appropriate large-system dynamic
limit, and the critical perturbation strength is polynomially small in the system size N . This scenario
occurs for example in the perturbed non-interacting
quantum dot considered by AGKL: in that case
the interaction can only rearrange four occupation
numbers at once, so it is strictly short-range on the
Fock-space hypercube. But this short-range scenario can also apply when the Fock-space hopping
is not strictly short-range, provided that the shortrange hopping is strong enough relative to the longrange hopping.

in the transition scenario this thin red line would curve upwards. From left to right, crossovers occur when the red lines
cross the smallest gap in a typical sample (œâ0 ), the typical

the boundary between (b) and (c) can sharpen up to a Fockspace delocalization transition in the large-system dynamic
limit. In regime (c) the Thouless energy is set by the slowestdecaying spatially uniform relaxation rate (œÑ ‚àí1 ) , while in
regime (d) it is set by the slowest spatial transport of the
conserved densities that remain conserved in the presence of
the perturbation.

we expect the analysis presented in this paper to hold
at any finite temperature, since even for an infinitedimensional Hilbert space, the onset of chaos near a
microcanonical energy shell is constrained by the Fockspace hopping range of integrability-breaking perturbations.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the
remainder of this section we present an overview of the
crossovers and/or transitions that separate the integrable
and chaotic regimes at finite size and in the appropriate dynamic limits. (To the best of our knowledge these
crossovers have not been discussed this thoroughly elsewhere.) In Sec. II we summarize the Fock-space delocalization picture introduced by AGKL, and discuss its
relevance to perturbed integrable systems. In Sec. III we
present a numerical study of perturbed Gaudin magnets,
and in Sec. IV we turn to quantum spin chains. Finally,
we identify the key open questions raised by our analysis.

From integrability to chaos: a summary

A general summary of some of the features of the
change from integrability to chaos is as follows: We consider systems with N degrees of freedom (usually spin1/2 spins) and Hamiltonian
HÃÇ = HÃÇ0 + VÃÇ .

(3)

HÃÇ0 is integrable, where this includes noninteracting particles. VÃÇ breaks the integrability. Thus for  6= 0 the
full Hamiltonian HÃÇ breaks the local conservation laws
of HÃÇ0 , except for energy and (possibly) particle number.
Both HÃÇ0 and VÃÇ are scaled with N to be extensive, so
that each defines a proper thermodynamic Hamiltonian
in its own right. We define our ‚ÄúFock space‚Äù as the manybody eigenstates of HÃÇ0 . VÃÇ produces hopping in that Fock
space.
We now consider the crossovers that take place as one
increases N while keeping  fixed and much smaller than
the characteristic energy scales of HÃÇ0 (Fig. 1). (We can
equivalently consider increasing  at fixed N , and will
use both perspectives interchangeably below.) In this
summary, we focus, for concreteness, on the many-body
level statistics. For completeness, we also include systems
where HÃÇ0 is MBL in this summary, although we do not
report any new work about MBL systems in this paper.
The first regime (a) occurs for small N (note that we
are taking  small enough that even in this regime we can
assume N  1). Here, the level spacing of the system
is large enough that any two adjacent levels of HÃÇ0 are
too far apart in energy for the perturbation to hybridize
them. All of the eigenstates of HÃÇ remain localized in Fock
space close to eigenstates of HÃÇ0 , so there are no systemwide many-body resonances. Here and throughout the
remainder of the paper, we define a ‚Äúmany-body resonance‚Äù as a resonance between two eigenstates of H0 that
differ from each other in extensively many quantum numbers. (For discussions of many-body resonances in the
contexts of MBL and/or Floquet heating, see Refs.46‚Äì54 .)
If HÃÇ0 is drawn from an ensemble of systems, in this regime
(a) there are no such resonances in almost all samples.
However, some rare samples will have accidental neardegeneracies in the spectrum of HÃÇ0 and these may be
lifted by the perturbation.
The second regime (b) of weak integrability-breaking is
where  is large enough to produce exponentially many
(in N ) eigenstates that are system-wide many-body resonances. These resonant eigenstates are linear combinations between Fock states that differ extensively. These
states are subject to energy-level repulsion, thus producing weak deviations from Poisson level statistics. But in
this second regime almost all eigenstates remain nonresonant and localized near eigenstates of HÃÇ0 , and the system thus remains localized in Fock space and nonchaotic:
some observable information about the initial state remains exactly conserved55 . The crossover between these
first two regimes can be detected by measures akin to

the ‚Äúadiabatic gauge potential‚Äù36,56 that are sensitive to
the presence of these rare resonances. The value of  at
this first crossover can range from exponentially small in
N for some interacting integrable systems, to power-law
small in N if HÃÇ0 is noninteracting delocalized particles,
to of order one (but still small) if HÃÇ0 is many-body localized in one dimension and both HÃÇ0 and VÃÇ are sufficiently
short-ranged in real space.
The third regime (c) of weak integrability-breaking is
one of quantum chaos and thermalization. This regime
sets in when the scale for level repulsion between distantin-Fock-space eigenstates becomes comparable to the
typical level spacing: thus, typical many-body eigenstates become involved in resonances and Fock-space localization breaks down. In this regime, a new characteristic energy scale emerges‚Äîthe Thouless energy, œâTh :
For energy differences œâ < œâTh the level statistics is
that of a random matrix. At the boundary between
regimes (b) and (c), the Thouless energy becomes comparable to the typical level spacing, as long-Fock-spacerange, slow relaxation processes become on-shell, destabilizing Fock-space localization. As one proceeds deeper
into regime (c), faster decay channels (corresponding to
shorter-range processes in Fock space) go on-shell and
thus open up, and œâTh increases. We emphasize that
throughout this regime, the slowest relaxation mode of
the system corresponds to Fock-space delocalization, and
the physical (real-space) dimensionality of the system is
still irrelevant.
Deep in regime (c), the Thouless energy scales as 2
by Fermi‚Äôs Golden Rule, but its scaling near the onset of
Fock-space delocalization can be anomalous. At a fixed
, there is some characteristic system size N ‚àó () (given by
inverting c (N )) at which the system enters regime (c).
At the
onset of regime (c), the Thouless energy is œâTh ‚àº
‚àó
2‚àíN () . Thus if 2‚àíN/2  c in the limit of large N (as
appears to be the case in all the models we study), the
Thouless energy at the onset of chaos is parametrically
smaller in  than 2 . To match the scaling of œâTh at
the onset of regime (c) with the behavior deep inside
regime (c), œâTh must increase by a parametrically large
amount in regime (c), as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Finally, for systems that are spatially extended and
such that HÃÇ0 has delocalized quasiparticles, there is a
third crossover or transition within the chaotic regime between the zero-dimensional quantum-dot-like regime (c)
where the mean free path for interaction-induced scattering of the quasiparticles is longer than the system
size, and a transport regime (d) where the mean free
path is smaller than the system size so diffusive dynamics emerges. (In cases with quenched randomness
the transport can be subdiffusive57 , and in cases with
long-range-in-real-space interactions it can be superdiffusive58 (see also Ref.59 ).) Most conventional approaches
to integrability-breaking, such as the Boltzmann equation34 , describe regime (d). In regime (d), local thermalization is faster than transport across the system, and the
latter process governs œâTh . The behavior in (c) followed

5
by this crossover leads to a non-monotonic dependence
of œâTh on N at fixed  (Fig. 1): the Thouless time first
decreases with system size as thermalization speeds up,
before slowing down again as it becomes bottlenecked by
transport.
The slowest-relaxing mode, which sets the Thouless energy, has a qualitatively different character in regimes (c)
and (d). In regime (c) it is a spatially uniform fluctuation
of a charge that is conserved under HÃÇ0 ; in regime (d) it
is a long-wavelength density fluctuation. Owing to the
macroscopically different character of these two modes
we conjecture that the crossover from (c) to (d) sharpens
up in the dynamic limit considered here60 .
Regime (d) also includes the infinite system, where we
can ask what processes dominate in setting the quasiparticle lifetime in the limit of small . For noninteracting
HÃÇ0 , these can be low-order scattering processes, as in a
standard Boltzmann equation scenario. For other systems, such as a XXZ spin chain perturbed in a way that
‚Äúbreaks‚Äù the Jordan-Wigner fermions (see Sec. IV), our
numerical results are inconclusive, but exact diagonalization of small systems suggests that high-order processes
dominate.
Note that for spatially extended systems where HÃÇ0 is
MBL and the interactions and hoppings in HÃÇ are shortranged enough in real space, the quantum-dot-like regime
(c) does not exist and the delocalization transition goes
directly to the transport regime (d).53

each Fock state to O(N 4 ) other states, related by moving
any two electrons from filled orbitals to empty orbitals.
For our purposes it is useful to generalize this discussion to the case where each application of VÃÇ connects
states that are separated by an order-one Hamming distance nh (so in the original AGKL analysis nh = 4). For
large N , the hopping graph is locally treelike, with coordination number z ‚àº N nh , effective hopping strength

The AGKL paper considers the effects of interactions
in a quantum dot with N  1 fermionic levels, at generic

intermediate filling f . Thus, HÃÇ0 = i=1 Œµi cÃÇ‚Ä†i cÃÇi . Moreover, since the levels being analyzed are all within the
single-particle Thouless energy of the dot, their eigenstates can be treated as random vectors. The manybody eigenstates of HÃÇ0 are Fock states in which each
such orbital is either occupied or unoccupied. These
eigenstates can be represented as bit-strings, or equivalently as the vertices of an N -dimensional hypercube.

Example: a perturbed all-to-all Ising model

Before we turn to interacting integrable models with
nontrivial quasiparticles, we introduce a version of the
AGKL transition that is amenable to small-system numerical studies. For numerically accessible system sizes
where one can fully diagonalize H, the AGKL model with
nh = 4 has the disadvantage that single hops are relatively ‚Äúlong-range‚Äù relative to the small Fock-space hypercube. To remedy this we consider a simpler model system that exhibits the phenomenology studied by AGKL

A particularly simple method for discerning the onset
of chaos numerically is via level statistics. In the model
Eq. (7), the ensembles of Hamiltonians corresponding
to HÃÇ0 and VÃÇ are chosen to yield robust Poisson and
GUE level statistics respectively, which are characteristic of generic integrable and (time-reversal-symmetrybreaking) chaotic quantum systems. Such level statistics
are most directly observed using the hri statistic62 , which
is defined as the average ratio (over the spectrum of some
fixed H) of consecutive gaps
hri = hrn i,

rn =

min (Œ¥n , Œ¥n+1 )

(9)

where Œ¥n = En+1 ‚àí En denotes the separation between
adjacent energy levels . . . > En+1 > En > . . . (these will
generically be non-degenerate for the models and symmetry sectors considered in this paper). Scaling of hri for
the Hamiltonian Eq. (7) according to the prediction Eq.
(8) is depicted in Fig. 2. We see that this Hamiltonian
interpolates between Poisson and GUE level statistics,
for which hri ‚âà 0.38 and hri ‚âà 0.6 respectively, and appears to have a transition between these extremes that
sharpens with increasing N with respect to the scaling
Eq. (8), and is thus consistent with a phase transition in
this large-N dynamic limit. One curious feature of Fig.
2 is that the curves collapse nearer the GUE value of hri
than the Poisson value of hri. We believe that this is a
finite-size effect, and emphasize that it is the clear steepening of these curves with N that provides the strongest
numerical evidence for a phase transition as N ‚Üí ‚àû in
this model, among the models studied in this paper.
It is also of interest to consider the crossover between
the dynamical regimes (a) and (b) of Fig. 1 for the AGKL

the Fock states for this trivially ‚Äúintegrable‚Äù model. The
nearest-neighbors in Fock space are pairs of states that
differ by only one spin flip. We have added a perturbation VÃÇ that breaks the ‚Äúintegrability‚Äù of HÃÇ0 and produces
‚Äúhops‚Äù in Fock space of distance only nh = 1, but we have
used two-site terms to do this in VÃÇ , since HÃÇ0 already had
two-site interactions. Note that the all-to-all interactions
in both HÃÇ0 and VÃÇ are scaled by the appropriate power of
N to make them have a proper thermodynamic limit for
 of order one. We will do this for all our models. The
crossover or transition to chaos (transition in this case)
occurs in the dynamic limit at a coupling c (N ) that decreases to zero in the large N limit. Thus all the models
we will study are quantum chaotic when the thermodynamic limit is taken at any nonzero finite .

sizes respectively, and computing hri from the middle 2/3 of
each spectrum. Since there are no degeneracies for generic

the minimum min(r) = minn rn over each sample. As
we argue in Appendix A, the Fock-space delocalization
model of AGKL predicts that the onset of the very first
resonances between adjacent energy levels is also set by
the critical perturbation strength in Eq. (4), but with
a renormalized effective coordination number for Fockspace hopping, zÃÉ = 22nh z. Thus we expect that min(r)
should exhibit the same scaling form as hri, although
with a very different scaling function, which is consistent with what is observed numerically in Fig. 3 (note
that this observation is complicated by the fact that relative fluctuations in the minimum min(r) are substantially
larger than those in hri for the same number of samples).
More generally, whenever an integrability-breaking perturbation induces purely local hopping in the Fock space
of HÃÇ0 , we expect that diagnostics of quantum chaos that
are sensitive to rare resonances, such as the adiabatic
gauge potential36 , should begin to deviate from their
 = 0 values at perturbation strengths that are polynomially small in the system size.

General case: Fermi‚Äôs Golden Rule

We now turn to the case of general interacting integrable systems, solvable via the Bethe ansatz. Note that
this class of systems includes both local spin chains and
all-to-all models such as Gaudin magnets and central spin
models63 . For these models, the coordinate Bethe ansatz
provides a labeling system for eigenstates, in terms of

the quantum numbers of occupied quasiparticles. These
state labels can be expressed either in terms of halfinteger Bethe quantum numbers (for local systems) or
state-dependent rapidities64 ; alternatively, one can label
them by their eigenvalues under each of the local and
quasi-local conserved charges65 . There are multiple different intuitively plausible ways to define a metric in this
state space. However, while integrability-breaking perturbations once again induce matrix elements among the
eigenstates, these matrix elements are no longer strictly
bounded in Hamming distance under any of these obvious metrics. Although we expect that physical locality
of VÃÇ imposes some constraints on its matrix elements
(for example, matrix elements between states with very
different values of a local conserved quantity should be
exponentially suppressed), the nature of these constraints
is not obvious.
Instead of working with an a priori metric, we will reformulate the transition vs. crossover question as follows.
A typical eigenstate of the integrable system is coupled to
other eigenstates with a distribution of matrix elements
P (t). The typical matrix element must decay at least exponentially with system size, but there can be rare matrix elements that are much larger. We can ask whether
first-order hybridization resonances become more or less
likely as we consider increasingly small matrix elements
(i.e., as we go to increasingly late times). For the onset
of chaos to be a transition, the likeliest first-order resonances must involve atypically large matrix elements,
which decay sub-exponentially with system size. One
can heuristically regard this procedure as using the matrix element size as a proxy for Hamming distance, but
we emphasize that it does not rely on any assumptions
regarding the geometry of state space.
It is helpful to consider a toy model in which the probability distribution of matrix elements follows a powerlaw distribution, P (t) ‚àº 1/tŒ≥ . (The power-law functional form is chosen for simplicity, although it appears

to be consistent with our numerical results for a perturbed XX chain presented in Sec. IV.) We now look
for resonant transitions out of this eigenstate (i.e., transitions for which the matrix element exceeds the energy
denominator), working our way from the highest to the
lowest energies. At energy scale œâ, we can ignore matrix
elementsRt < œâ, so the initial eigenstate is coupled to
‚àû
N (œâ) ‚â° œâ P (t)dt ‚àº œâ 1‚àíŒ≥ other states. The level spacing among these states scales as œâ Œ≥‚àí1 ; if Œ≥ > 2, this level
spacing asymptotically becomes smaller than the matrix
element œâ, and the initial state is unstable to long-range
resonances at lowest order in perturbation theory. In
this scenario, the relevant level spacing for delocalization
is that of the slowest transitions, and this is set by the
level spacing of the full system, i.e., it is exponential in
N . By contrast, when Œ≥ < 2, the likeliest resonances
involve the largest matrix elements; the nature of these
depends on microscopic details but they will generically
decay either algebraically or exponentially in N .
Note that there are two regimes within the crossover:
2 < Œ≥ < 3 and Œ≥ > 3. In the
R former regime, the total
spectral weight of VÃÇ , given by t2 P (t)dt, is dominated by
transitions with a large matrix element. In this regime, as
one increases the perturbation strength  past the threshold for chaos, the relaxation rate speeds up as ‚Äúfaster‚Äù
thermalization channels, involving stronger transitions,
become accessible. In this regime, at the level of the
Golden Rule, the critical thermalization rate at the onset
of chaos scales as Œìc ‚àº (Œ≥‚àí1)/(Œ≥‚àí2) . On the other hand,
when Œ≥ > 3, long-range transitions dominate the spectral
sum, so the perturbation acts effectively like a random
matrix, and the thermalization rate is only weakly affected by the opening of additional decay channels.
We now return to the question of probing the matrix
element distribution numerically, with no assumptions
about the underlying distribution of matrix elements.
The idea behind this approach is to estimate when the
broadening in the linewidth of Fock states due to dynamically introduced integrability-breaking perturbations becomes comparable to their level spacing. This provides
an estimate of the perturbation strength at which a quasiparticle picture ceases to be meaningful. We note that
similar considerations were used by AGKL to demarcate the Fock-space delocalization transition in quantum
dots6 .
Given a perturbed integrable system H = HÃÇ0 + V ,
we proceed as follows. First let |ai denote an eigenstate
chosen uniformly at random from the mid-spectrum of
HÃÇ0 (defined as e.g. the middle 2/3 of its spectrum) and
consider its matrix elements Vba = hb|V |ai to other eigenstates in the mid-spectrum of HÃÇ0 . Ranking the squared
matrix |Vba |2 in decreasing order for fixed a and all midspectrum b with |Ea ‚àíEb | < ‚Ñ¶ for some fixed O(1) energy
scale ‚Ñ¶, averaging over all a and then averaging over random couplings yields a ranked list of mean-squared offdiagonal matrix elements |V1 |2 > |V2 |2 > . . . > |VM |2 in
the mid-spectrum.
Each such matrix element |Vm |2 defines a ‚Äúbatch‚Äù of

8
other matrix elements |Vn |2 ‚àº |Vm |2 of the same order of
magnitude. Concretely, we can define this batch as the
set of n such that n ‚â• m and |Vm |2 /e2 < |Vn |2 . Letting
Nbatch (m) denote the number of |Vn |2 in this batch, the
decay rate to m predicted by Fermi‚Äôs golden rule is given

since in the absence of level repulsion, the mean level

condition for the validity of Fermi‚Äôs Golden Rule, namely
that the batch of possible final states under consideration

is because exponential decay of the Fermi golden rule

Numerical diagnostics for Fock-space
delocalization

The above discussion suggests two complementary numerical approaches for discerning a Fock-space delocalization transition in interacting integrable systems. The
first is simply plotting hri against , as in Fig. 2, and
hri
using this to deduce a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù c (N ), either from the
crossing point of the curves for hri if this is visible, or
hri
by numerically extracting c (N ) at which hri ‚âà 0.49
(halfway between Poisson and GUE) if there is no clear
crossing point. In this paper we will always consider GUE
perturbations, with a view to enhancing the change in hri
(there is no reason to expect any of our conclusions to
be altered for GOE perturbations, beyond their smaller
value of hri ‚âà 0.53). This diagnostic refers solely to the
level statistics of the Hamiltonian in question.
The second approach is plotting the Fermi golden rule
estimate Eq. (12) against system size N , and checking

Interacting integrable quantum dots

Let us now apply the above considerations to
integrability-breaking perturbations of interacting, integrable quantum dots. Note that this generalizes the analysis of AGKL6 , who considered such perturbations for
non-interacting quantum dots. The difference between a
non-interacting and an interacting integrable quantum
dot is captured by the quantum numbers, or ‚Äúrapidities‚Äù defining the state. In a non-interacting quantum
dot, each state is uniquely determined by the occupation numbers of a fixed set of rapidities. In an interacting integrable quantum dot, these rapidities depend on
the state; their mutual interactions are captured by the
Bethe equations.
To be concrete, let us take as our interacting, integrable quantum dot the following transverse spin-1/2
Gaudin model
1 X ‚àó
HÃÇGaudin = ‚àö
Ji Jj SÃÇi+ SÃÇj‚àí .
(13)
N i6=j
This model is integrable for all choices of the couplings
Ji ‚àà C. It has a global U (1) symmetry and a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù
time-reversal symmetry, achieved by rotating each spin
independently about the z-axis to cancel the phase of its
complex coupling Ji .
Local integrable systems, such as the spin-1/2 XXZ
chain, are characterized by an extensive number of local conserved charges. In such systems, the Hamiltonian
PN
HÃÇ = i=1 hÃÇi can be written as a sum over local terms
hi , and there exist extensively many other linearly inP (n)
dependent operators QÃÇ(n) = i qÃÇi , n = 2, . . . , N with

9

qÃÇi local that are conserved and mutually commuting,
i.e.
[QÃÇ(m) , QÃÇ(n) ] = 0,

[QÃÇ(m) , HÃÇ] = 0,

m, n = 2, . . . , N.
(14)
For all-to-all models such as quantum dots, the notion
of spatial locality is no longer natural. Instead, integrability in such systems is characterized by the existence
of extensively many conserved charges that are ‚Äú2-local‚Äù
in the complexity theory sense. Gaudin‚Äôs construction of
these models proceeds by solving for sets of commuting
spin bilinears with a specific structure; for the model Eq.
(13), these take the form

formalism also leads directly to the model‚Äôs exact Betheansatz solution.
Our starting point is the so-called ‚Äúrational Gaudin algebra‚Äù associated with the Hamiltonian Eq. (13), which
is determined by the couplings Ji and a continuous parameter z, such that66,68,70

Integrable spin models of this type were introduced
by Gaudin66 , building on earlier work by Richardson67 .
The model Eq. (13) lies in a more general class than
the models originally considered by Gaudin; this class of
‚Äúnon-skew‚Äù Gaudin models first arose in the context of
nuclear physics68 , with several subsequent studies69‚Äì73 .
Recently, an experimental protocol for realizing Eq. (13)
(with real couplings Ji ‚àà R) in systems of atoms coupled
to an optical cavity was proposed74 .

Quasiparticle Fock space for the Gaudin model

To make contact with the AGKL intuition for noninteracting quantum dots, it is helpful to express integrability of the Gaudin model in terms of ‚Äúquasiparticle operators‚Äù, which are analogous to pair creation and
annihilation operators in the Richardson model67 . This

of the AGKL Fock-space delocalization model for few-site
perturbations of this system hinges on how far single-site
operators SÃÇi¬± induce local hopping in this quasiparticle
Fock space. Based on the fact that the single-site operators SÃÇi¬± are simply linear combinations of the BÃÇ ¬± (z), one
might conjecture that they generate hops at a Hamming
distance nh = 1 in this Fock space, and therefore induce
a Fock-space delocalization transition. Below we present
numerical evidence in favour of this claim for accessible
system sizes.

symmetry for even N . The two-site term is the dominant
source of Fock-space hopping, and has nh = 2 in our
previous notation, so that the Fock-space delocalization

for the onset of chaos. As shown in Fig. 5, the hri statistic exhibits an excellent collapse to this scaling law on
accessible system sizes. However, there is not much evidence for steepening with N , presumably because the
hopping distance nh = 4 in this case is only a few times
smaller than the largest accessible system size, N = 14.
It is worth emphasizing that the power laws in Eqs.
(29) and (31) can be deduced directly from the hri data
itself, and are clearly distinguishable within the sample
error of a fit to the Fock-space delocalization ansatz Eq.
(6) over accessible N . Concretely, we can study the N
dependence of the onset of chaos by defining the threshold (r, N ) at which hri takes on an intermediate value
hri = r ‚àà (0.41, 0.57) for each N . This is interpolated to
unsampled values of r by using an accurate spline (error
within linewidth) of the raw data. From (r, N ) we can
estimate the exponent ŒΩ such that

The resulting estimate for hŒΩi, together with the standard error of this average (note that n = 6 for our simulations) is plotted in Fig. 6 for the perturbed interacting integrable models Eq. (28) and Eq. (30). The first
model seems to exhibit a steepening transition on either
side of the theoretically predicted exponent from Fockspace delocalization Eq. (6). For the model with the
larger hopping range HGaudin+4 , no such steepening is
visible for the reason discusssed above; correspondingly,
the agreement with the theoretical prediction Eq. (31) is
particularly good.
This concludes our numerical demonstration that the
level statistics of perturbed interacting quantum dots
scale as expected from the arguments of AGKL. We next
turn to the Fermi golden rule estimate, based on the decay rate of quasiparticles, that was discussed above. In
hri
particular, one can directly compare c and FGR
for
c
the interacting models, as discussed in Section II D, and
check for polynomial versus exponential decay with N .
This check is depicted in Fig. 7. We see that accessible
system sizes are consistent with the polynomial decay
predicted by a Fock-space delocalization model. Let us
however emphasize that from numerics alone, it is impossible to rule out a very weak exponential decay that could
eventually dominate the AGKL prediction at larger N ,
resulting in a crossover to quantum chaos rather than a
transition.

eye, and directly proportional to the Fock-space delocalization predictions Eqs. (29) and (31). For both models, both

markedly differently from the mean r, seeming to exhibit regime change at a coupling strength that is exponentially small in the system size. This behaviour
is consistent with earlier results on the adiabatic gauge
potential in perturbed interacting integrable systems36 .
However, as shown in Fig. 8 for HÃÇGaudin+2 , such exponential scaling manifestly fails to collapse the behaviour
of hri between the extremes of integrability and chaos
0.38 < hri < 0.6. The power law scaling of hri depicted
in Figs. 4 and 5 thus indicates a robust intermediate
regime between the onset of many-body resonances and
the onset of chaos, that is large relative to the conjectured perturbation strength c (N ) ‚àº 1/(N ŒΩ log N ) for
the onset of chaos in these models. One intuitive explanation for this behaviour, compared to the all-to-all
Ising model discussed above, is that for perturbed Gaudin
dots, the matrix elements of few-spin perturbations VÃÇ
have long tails in Fock space that allow some many-body
resonances to form at exponentially small , but sufficiently little weight in these tails that a delocalization
transition in hri persists at larger values of .
Finally, we note that one can also break U (1) symmetry of HÃÇ0 while preserving integrability, by adding an
onsite XY field of the form71

with hXY arbitrary. We have checked that this does not
alter the observation of power-law scaling in hri for fewsite chaotic perturbations and accessible system sizes.

FIG. 9. Top: Scaling of hri for the Hamiltonian Eq. (35),
according to theoretical expectations for a Fock space delocalization transition in this model Eq. (29). It is clear that
thermalization sets in faster than expected for a Fock space
delocalization transition. Simulation details as for Fig. 4. Error bars denote the standard error of the sample mean over
all realizations, which is < 0.1% for all datapoints shown.
Bottom: Thresholds for the critical perturbation strength extracted from a Fermi golden rule estimate Eq. (12) and the
numerical hri data respectively, according to the prescription
described in Section II D, for the model Eq. (35). Black dotted lines are guides to the eye, and directly proportional to
the Fock-space delocalization transition prediction for twosite hopping, Eq. (29). We see that both numerical estimates
for c decay notably faster than the delocalization transition
estimate for accessible N .

j<k

Naƒ±Ãàvely, the two-fermion terms flip two spins and therefore correspond to a hopping distance nh = 2 in Fock
space, with an associated critical value c (N ) for thermalization scaling as in Eq. (29). However, the attached
Jordan-Wigner strings are highly non-local operators in
the onsite basis, and generate long-range hopping in Fock
space that leads to a delocalization crossover rather than
a delocalization transition. Correspondingly, there is no
scaling collapse to Eq. (29) in hri and we instead observe
a drift towards thermalization, as depicted in Fig. 9.
At the same time, it is difficult to rule out numerically
the possibility that the long-ranged Fock space hopping
in these models again results in a delocalization transition, but with a larger effective hopping range than the

naƒ±Ãàve expectation nh = 2. Our numerical results are in
fact consistent with a hopping range nh ‚âà 5, but this
hopping range does not have a natural microscopic interpretation that is consistent with the results of previous
sections, suggesting that the agreement with this powerlaw fit might be spurious. We now turn to perturbed
local integrable systems, for which the evidence for a
crossover at exponentially small perturbation strengths
is more stark.

where xi , yi are i.i.d. random numbers chosen from the
interval (‚àí1, 1). This choice of HÃÇ0 and VÃÇ is motivated
by the following logic. HÃÇXX maps to free fermions under
a Jordan-Wigner transformation; this allows us to define
an unambiguous Hamming distance in terms of the occupation numbers of the fermions, precisely as in AGKL.
However, under the Jordan-Wigner mapping, our choice
of VÃÇ becomes nonlocal in fermion operators; thus, as in
the generic interacting case, the interaction has matrix
elements to arbitrarily large Hamming distance. Finally,
since perturbations acting on adjacent sites do not commute, HÃÇ in the limit of large  becomes cleanly chaotic.
If we had instead perturbed with random fields at every
site, there would have been a further transition to a localized phase with increasing , complicating our analysis
of the onset of chaos.
Our numerical analysis of the crossover to chaos in
this model closely parallels that in the previous section.
Fig. 10 shows the crossover in hri, which collapses when
rescaled by a factor that is exponential in L. That the
crossover does not sharpen appreciably with system size,
and that the crossover scale varies exponentially with system size, are both suggestive evidence for a crossover
rather than a transition in this model. Fig. 11 shows
the dependence of the crossover scale on system size, extracted from the Golden-Rule approach outlined in Sec.
II D as well as direct analysis of the crossover in hri. The
methods agree reasonably well on the scaling with L. Although we cannot definitively tell an exponential from a
power law with the modest dynamic range that is numerically accessible, fitting the data to a power law gives

FIG. 10. Adjacent-gap ratio hri vs. rescaled coupling /0 (L),

is chosen so that hri = 0.5 when  = 0 (L) for L = 9. The

samples for L = 11; and over 50 samples for L = 13.

1). Finally, as Fig. 11 shows, the crossover in the minimum gap occurs at parametrically lower values of  than
the crossover in hri, i.e., the regime (b) in Fig. 1 grows
with system size75 .

Matrix elements of the Jordan-Wigner string

The rationale for our choice of the Hamiltonian (37)
was that for this model the unperturbed problem can
be written in terms of free fermions, so one can define a natural Hamming distance between two states in
terms of the difference in their occupation numbers. Each

The model in the absence of twisting and the uniform

Z2 and reflection symmetry. Since we would like to have
an integrable limit with Poisson level statistics, we fix
g = 0.3, pick Œ∏ randomly for each sample, and limit our
attention to odd system sizes L. (The last restriction
eliminates some residual degeneracies in the half-filled
sector; since we will consider a perturbation that breaks
U (1) conservation, the only way to avoid the half-filled
sector is to work with L odd.) We choose

where WÃÇ (x) = exp iœÄ n<x (1 + œÉÃÇnz )/2 , and OÃÇ(x) is a
local operator that only rearranges a small number of
fermions (and therefore, on its own, would only give transitions to some bounded Hamming distance). Thus, the
large-scale rearrangements due to VÃÇ are due to the matrix
elements of WÃÇ (x), which we now discuss. For this exploration, we choose open boundary conditions and work
with initial states in which the fermions are at half filling; we also choose x = L/2. The matrix elements of
WÃÇ (x) between any pair of many-body Slater-determinant
eigenstates can then be efficiently evaluated as a determinant76 .
Our results are shown in Fig. 12. We highlight a few
key features. First, the natural Hamming distance is
not predictive of the strength of transitions: some of the
largest matrix elements are to Hamming distances larger
than 1. Intuitively, the Jordan-Wigner string looks like
a pulsed step-function potential, and thus has larger matrix elements between states connected by small momentum transfer: thus, not all transitions at a given naive
Hamming distance are equivalent. Second, the tail of
the distribution to small matrix elements at any fixed
Hamming distance has the form P (|Mij |) ‚àº 1/|Mij |. In
the taxonomy of Sec. II C this tail has too little weight
to provide the dominant transitions. At larger |Mij | the
distribution bends and the apparent exponent increases
to P (|Mij |) ‚àº 1/|Mij |2 , which is exactly the marginal
case where transitions at all scales contribute to delocalization. Identifying whether a transition or crossover
occurs will require a more intensive numerical study of
(a) the precise form of the tail to large matrix elements,
and (b) how the crossover between the two regimes of
Fig. 12(a) scales with system size. Third, the mean matrix element at any Hamming distance decays exponentially with system size with approximately the same decay constant, so that (entropically) the spectral weight
for larger system sizes is dominated by transitions to

large Hamming distance.

V.

CONCLUSION

We have studied the system-size dependence of the
onset of many-body quantum chaos in a variety of perturbed integrable systems. We have further argued that
generalizations of the analysis of AGKL predicting a
Fock-space delocalization transition for perturbed, noninteracting quantum dots apply to these systems. Depending on the effective hopping range of the perturbation in the many-body Fock space defined by the eigenstates of the unperturbed integrable system, this analysis predicts either a crossover or a transition, at a perturbation strength that tends to zero as the system size
N ‚Üí ‚àû. We have presented detailed numerical evidence
that both possible scenarios are realized for perturbations
of interacting or non-interacting integrable systems.
It is natural to ask whether analogous transitions can
happen if one scales the integrability-breaking perturbation  with time, in an infinite system, rather than with
system size. (This question was considered for MBL transitions in Ref.23 .) For extended infinite integrable systems, the crossovers with time are much simpler than
those with system size: thermalization in finite-size systems is slowed down by the discreteness of energy levels,
which is not relevant for infinite systems. The finite-time
crossover occurs at a mean free time œÑ ‚àº 1/2 . The finitetime crossover in the dynamic limit of small  can either
happen through processes that primarily rearrange an
order one number of quasiparticles, or through processes
that rearrange a number of quasiparticles that diverges in
this limit; this depends on whether the spectral weight
of the operator VÃÇ is dominated by small or large matrix elements. (In the power law model of Sec. II C this
crossover from small-scale to large-scale rearrangements
occurs at Œ≥ = 3, while the finite-size behavior changes its
character at Œ≥ = 2.) The mean free time scales the same

15
way with  in both cases, but one might expect that the
behavior of quantities such as out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) differs between these cases. Meanwhile,
one experimentally relevant class of perturbed integrable
systems where the temporal crossovers to chaos are not
well understood, and might be elucidated by the considerations in this paper, are examples where integrability
is broken by an external trapping potential7,26,34,77‚Äì79 .
We leave further exploration of these questions for future work.
Our work raises at least two important questions for
further theoretical analysis. The first is whether the
statistics of the matrix elements of any perturbed interacting integrable systems can be characterized with
sufficient accuracy to argue definitively for a Fock-space
delocalization transition. The Gaudin-Richardson models studied numerically in this work seem to provide a
natural starting point for tackling this question, since
their eigenstates are particularly simple to write down
explicitly and their couplings can be sampled randomly
for any system size. The second question is whether the
apparent simplicity of quantum integrability breaking in
certain cases reflects a corresponding and hitherto unexplored simplicity in classical integrability breaking. For
example, the sophisticated analysis of Wayne for interacting classical chains2 seems to suggest a critical perturbation strength for breaking integrability that is polynomially small in the system size, as in Eq. (2). This is
intriguingly similar to the expected scaling of the Fockspace delocalization transition in some many-body quantum systems.

A greedy estimate for small denominators

We now present a simple argument for how the power
law dependence on N in Eq. (6) can be understood as a
consequence of small denominators in perturbation theory. This is closely related to the treatment of AGKL6 ,
although it is too simple to capture the logarithmic correction; the connection with AGKL‚Äôs results is discussed
in the next section.
For concreteness, let HÃÇ = HÃÇ0 + VÃÇ . Consider HÃÇ0 such
that its eigenstates are product states over N two-state
spins, or fermionic Slater determinants for a fixed set of
N single-particle states. In these cases the Fock space is
simply represented as the corners of an hypercube. Assume the hops in Fock space produced by VÃÇ are of Hamming distance nh . Consider two eigenstates |ai and |bi
of HÃÇ0 that are adjacent in energy in the spectrum. Typically, these two states differ by Hamming distance ‚àº
= N/2.
This means that the states |ai and |bi are first coupled at
an order l ‚àº
= N/(2nh ) in perturbation theory. Our goal
eff
is to estimate the effective coupling Vab
between states
|ai and |bi to leading order in the perturbation strength
. It is this coupling that first (upon increasing  from
zero) produces hybridization and energy-level repulsion
between |ai and |bi in the eigenstates and spectrum of
HÃÇ.
First note that the leading coupling between |ai and
|bi occurs at order l in VÃÇ . The coupling is due to all

is the square of the leading-order coupling, where Eaan =
Ea ‚àí Ean . We have chosen to expand around |ai, but
since Eb is typically much closer to Ea than any of the
intermediate states, the expansion around |bi gives essentially the same result.
For non-interacting systems with delocalized quasiparticles, this sum is dominated by rare paths with the smallest energy denominators, since these paths give terms
that are factorially (in l) larger than those from typical
paths. The size of this dominant contribution can be estimated from simple combinatorics, that is entirely analogous to arguments made in previous analyses of highorder perturbation theory6,24 .
First, we obtain the number Npath (l) of shortest paths
in Fock space connecting |ai to |bi via the hopping term
VÃÇ that are present in the sum in Eq. (A1). For simplicity,
we consider the case where |ai and |bi differ by precisely
lnh spin flips.
We may count the paths sequentially from |ai to |bi:
Let N1 denote the number of possible choices for |a1 i, N2

16
the number of possible choices for |a2 i having fixed |a1 i,
etc., until there is only one choice Nl = 1 for |al i = |bi,
having fixed {a1 , a2 , . . . , al‚àí1 }. Then the total number
of paths is given by Npath (l) = N1 N2 . . . Nl‚àí1 .
Corresponding to this enumeration of shortest paths
between |ai and |bi there exists a ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù algorithm for
estimating the smallest path denominator ‚àÜ‚àópath in the
sum Eq. (A1). By Poisson level statistics of HÃÇ0 , once
the state |ak‚àí1 i is fixed, the ‚Äúnext‚Äù denominator Eaak
is approximately uniformly distributed over the typical
bandwidth for nh -particle hopping w. Since there are
Nk possible choices for |ak i, the average smallest denominator available to use at step k is approximately

this should bound the true smallest path denominator

(A1) also has its numerator. If the distributions of the
matrix elements of VÃÇ have a fat enough tail to very large
values, then the largest term in the sum may also be set
by that tail. But for most choices of VÃÇ , including any
choice where VÃÇ has poly(N ) random coupling constants,
these distributions will not have fat tails and the largest
factor will be well approximated by the smallest denominator. This yields an approximate lower bound on the

This recovers Eq. (4) up to order one factors and the
logarithmic correction (it in fact also corresponds to the
Anderson criterion for delocalization6 , i.e. hopping amplitude equals local level spacing). This argument also
justifies why the hri statistic, which measures level repulsion, should exhibit the same leading N -dependence
as the threshold for Fock-space delocalization.

AGKL-type estimates for the onset of
many-body resonances

We now illustrate how the above argument relates to
the earlier analysis of AGKL6 . In the language of our
Fig. 1, the AGKL argument captures the transition from
regime (b) to regime (c), at which typical many-body
eigenstates become resonant with states that are adjacent
in energy in the spectrum and Fock-space delocalization
occurs. In fact, the AGKL analysis can be extended to
model the crossover from regime (a) to regime (b), i.e.
the onset of the first many-body resonances in the system, as we will discuss below.
Our starting point is the leading-order perturbative exeff
pression Eq. (A1) for the effective coupling Vab
between
two typical states that are adjacent in energy, which can
be estimated in terms of the effective Fock-space hopping
strength t and many-body bandwidth w as

Notice that this is the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù of the classical KAM
argument, which uses Diophantine conditions to bound
small denominators in the perturbation series from below, thereby bounding the perturbation series from above
and guaranteeing its convergence and the persistence of
integrability1 . Here our strategy is instead to bound
small denominators from above, which bounds the perturbation series from below and yields an estimate for
the onset of level repulsion and quantum chaos.

Our rough estimate of the onset of chaos is when Vab
‚àíN
becomes of order the many-body level spacing ‚àº w2 .
Assuming that nh is of order one, and dropping order

as i.i.d. random variables, and the energy denominators
Eaaj as being i.i.d. uniformly distributed within the interval [‚àíw, w]. This is of course an idealization that neglects the correlations between states, but is a reasonable
assumption for typical states of an integrable system at
large N  1.

17
As noted by AGKL, it follows from these assumpl
tions that |V~a | = w wt eYl‚àí1 , with Yl‚àí1 a gamma distributed random variable with probability density function fYl‚àí1 (y) = y l‚àí2 e‚àíy /Œì(l ‚àí 1). Thus the cumulative

now relax this assumption and consider arbitrary values
0 < Œ± < 1. We will find that the threshold for the first
resonance at typical Hamming distance Œ±N can depend
strongly on Œ±.
First consider the effective matrix element |Vab |2 for
states |ai and |bi at a Hamming distance Œ±N . The lowest
order process coupling these states is now at order l =
Œ±N/nh . Thus the number of shortest Fock space paths

One could instead ask for the threshold at which the
first many-body resonances occur between pairs of states.
This will in general depend on the typical Hamming distance Œ±N between the pairs of states under consideration. So far we have been considering typical states that

(A24)
From here, one can estimate a threshold for the first
resonances at Hamming distance Œ±N . Neglecting correlations between states, as in AGKL, it follows from Eq.
(A12) that the probability for at least one resonance at
Hamming distance Œ±N among all eigenstates |ai is set by
the condition
2N xN (w/dŒ± ) ‚âà 1.

(A25)

18
By Eq. (A22), this happens at the threshold

which amounts to an upwards renormalization of the ‚Äúeffective coordination number‚Äù by a factor 2nh /Œ± . For pairs
of states that are neighbouring in energy, for which typically Œ± ‚âà 1/2, this upwards renormalization is by a factor
z 7‚Üí 22nh z.

We deduce that at any given Hamming distance scale
‚àº Œ±N , the first resonances at this Hamming distance
(corresponding to one definition for the threshold between regimes (a) and (b) in Fig. 1) happen at a weaker
perturbation strength than the corresponding transition
between regimes (b) and (c), as one might expect. However, the much stronger Œ±-dependence (e.g. as Œ± ‚Üí 0) of
the threshold for ‚Äúfirst resonances‚Äù than for ‚Äútypical resonances‚Äù indicates that the distinction between (a) and
(b) is fuzzier than that between (b) and (c), and therefore
more properly viewed as a crossover than as a transition.
