Prethermalization has been extensively studied in systems close to integrability. We propose a more
general, yet conceptually simpler, setup for this phenomenon. We consider a—possibly nonintegrable—
reference dynamics, weakly perturbed so that the perturbation breaks at least one conservation law of the
reference dynamics. We argue then that the evolution of the system proceeds via intermediate (generalized)
equilibrium states of the reference dynamics. The motion on the manifold of equilibrium states is governed
by an autonomous equation, flowing towards global equilibrium in a time of order g−2, where g is the
perturbation strength. We also describe the leading correction to the time-dependent reference equilibrium
state, which is, in general, of order g. The theory is well confirmed in numerical calculations of model
Hamiltonians, for which we use a numerical linked cluster expansion and full exact diagonalization.

I. INTRODUCTION
Prethermalization [1] has emerged over the past decade
as an interesting and ubiquitous phenomenon in the
dynamics of ultracold quantum gases in one-dimensional
geometries [2–6]. In general, it refers to a separation of
timescales: Some systems far from equilibrium quickly
relax to long-lived (non)thermal states (not true thermal
equilibrium states) on short timescales, before eventually
relaxing to the expected true thermal equilibrium states on
much longer timescales.
There are some general instances of this phenomenon that
are well understood, analytically and numerically. A first
example is quenches in isolated noninteracting (integrable)
systems, in which interactions (integrability-breaking perturbations) of strength g are turned on [7–15]. By dephasing,
observables quickly settle to quasisteady states that are well
described by generalized Gibbs ensembles (GGEs) [16–20]
of the noninteracting systems. The observables then relax
to the thermal equilibrium values (thermalize) in a much
longer timescale ∝ g−2 , as predicted by kinetic Boltzmannlike equations. The latter can be derived applying timedependent perturbation theory to the GGEs [21,22] and,
physically, describe the effects of collisions between (quasi)

particles. It was recently shown numerically that weakly
breaking integrability in strongly interacting integrable
systems also results in thermalization rates ∝ g2 [23].
A second example is isolated weakly interacting driven
systems, for which GGEs and kinetic Boltzmann-like equations are also relevant [24,25]. A third example is periodically
driven systems at high frequency. In general, they quickly
reach a time-periodic state that can be identified as a Gibbs
state corresponding to an effective Hamiltonian, before
relaxing to the thermal (infinite-temperature [26,27]) state
in a timescale that is exponentially long in the frequency of
the drive [28–33].
In this work, we argue that the first two examples above are
instances of a more universal phenomenon, a phenomenon
that occurs whenever an equilibrating dynamics (to a
thermal- or GGE-like state) is weakly perturbed so that, at
least, one of the conserved quantities in the original dynamics
is no longer conserved in the weakly perturbed dynamics. A
similar point of view was put forward in Refs. [34,35] for
open quantum systems. We first present this conclusion in a
loose manner in Sec. II, and then, in Secs. III and IV, we
develop a systematic treatment of weakly perturbed systems
in which a conservation law is broken. The remainder of
the paper is dedicated to demonstrating, in the context of
numerical experiments, the validity and accuracy of this
systematic treatment. Section V, in which we introduce the
models, quenches, observables, etc., is the preamble to
the numerical experiments, which are reported in Sec. VI.
A summary and discussion of our results is presented in
Sec. VII, while the Appendixes report details of our
analytical and numerical calculations.

II. PREAMBLE
Setup.—We consider isolated extended quantum systems
that are translationally invariant. For the sake of concreteness, one can think of chains with L ≫ 1 sites. We have a
pair of Hamiltonians Ĥ 0 and Ĥ, in which the latter includes
the former plus a weak perturbation,
Ĥ ¼ Ĥ0 þ gV̂;

ð1Þ

where g is small. We assume that the (reference)
Hamiltonian Ĥ 0 has a conservation law, say Q̂, which is
not shared by Ĥ, namely, ½Ĥ0 ; Q̂ ¼ 0 but ½V̂; Q̂ ≠ 0. We
are interested in cases in which Ĥ0 , Q̂, Ĥ, and V̂ are
extensive operators. In order to take the thermodynamic
limit, it is helpful to deal with the intensive counterparts
of those operators: ĥ0 ¼ Ĥ0 =L, q̂ ¼ Q̂=L, ĥ ¼ Ĥ=L, etc.
In our numerical calculations, Q̂ (q̂) is the total number of
particles (the filling), or, in the spin language, the total
magnetization (the site magnetization).
Assumption of fast equilibration.—We consider cases in
which the dynamics generated by Ĥ0, even when the
system is far from equilibrium, results in fast equilibration.
Namely, we assume that, for experimentally relevant translational-invariant initial states ρ̂I , observables converge
within a time τ to the predictions of an ensemble (e.g.,
microcanonical) of statistical mechanics ρ̂e0 ;q , with ðe0 ; qÞ ¼
ðhĥ0 iρ̂I ; hq̂iρ̂I Þ. The restriction “experimentally relevant” is
put to avoid cases in which the initial state is a macroscopic
superposition of states at different densities ðe0 ; qÞ (see
Ref. [36] for a discussion of this issue in the context of
quantum quenches). The restriction to translation-invariant
states is used to avoid having leading effects in the equilibration dynamics that are L dependent, e.g., particle or
energy transport, which would complicate the picture.
Initial prethermalization.—Even though there is no
standard perturbation theory around a genuinely interacting
Ĥ0 , it is reasonable to assume that the effect of the
perturbation is small at times τ ≪ 1=g, in the sense that,
for such times, one can meaningfully approximate the
dynamics under Ĥ by the reference dynamics generated by
Ĥ0 . Therefore, by the assumption of fast equilibration, one
should observe a fast initial relaxation of observables
toward the predictions of ρ̂e0 ;q . The latter state can be very
different from the thermal equilibrium ensemble ρ̂e associated to Ĥ. ρ̂e0 ;q differs from ρ̂e by the fact that q is an
additional constraint [of course, it also differs because e0 is
the energy density of Ĥ0 and not that of Ĥ, but that
difference is only OðgÞ].
Thermalization rate.—To determine how fast the true
equilibrium is approached, let us start from ρ̂e0 ;q and look at
the change in hQ̂ðτÞie0 ;q . We do this perturbatively:

ð2Þ

where we use that ½Ĥ 0 ; Q̂ ¼ ½Ĥ0 ; ρ̂e0 ;q  ¼ 0. The precise
error estimate Oð·Þ will only be argued for later. The
important point to be highlighted from Eq. (2) is that
the leading order correction to hQ̂ie0 ;q vanishes because
h½V̂; Q̂ie0 ;q ¼ 0, by the cyclic property of the trace and the
fact that ½Q̂; ρ̂e0 ;q  ¼ 0. This suggests that the thermalization rate is ∝ g2 . Indeed, carrying out the expansion one
order further, we recognize Fermi’s golden rule. Finally, if
we had replaced Q̂ by a general observable Ô, the first
order term does not vanish. It results in a universal
deviation of hÔi in the instantaneous state from that of
ρ̂e0 ;q .
III. SLOW DYNAMICS OF APPROXIMATELY
CONSERVED QUANTITIES
In this section, we present a derivation of an approximate
autonomous equation governing the dynamics of the densities ðe0 ; qÞ. This is Eq. (23), or, at a more abstract level,
Eq. (21). Our derivation is not mathematically rigorous, it
uses physical assumptions and goes substantially beyond
the heuristics presented above. Its validity and accuracy are
confirmed by numerical calculations in Sec. VI.
A. Slow variables
We identify the densities ðe0 ; qÞ as slow variables. To set
up a controlled derivation, we need a projection map from
states ρ̂ to ðe0 ; qÞ. It turns out, however, that it is more
natural to start with a projection P from ρ̂ to a probability
distribution p on ðe0 ; qÞ. Indeed, each such p can be lifted
to a ρ̂ by
Z
ρ̂p ¼ de0 dqpðe0 ; qÞρ̂e0 ;q ;
ð3Þ
and the physically most natural case is, of course, when
pðe0 ; qÞ is a Dirac delta distribution δðe0 − e0 Þδðq − q Þ;
cf. the discussion on “experimentally relevant states” in
Sec. II. To construct the map P, a natural approach is to
measure Ĥ0 and Q̂:
pρ̂ ðe0 ; qÞ ∝ Tr½ρ̂PðĤ 0 ≈ e0 LÞPðQ̂ ≈ qLÞ;

ð4Þ

where PðĤ 0 ≈ e0 LÞ is a spectral projection of Ĥ 0 on the
interval ½e0 L − δE ; e0 L þ δE  with a resolution δE that is
much larger than the level spacing, but smaller than any
relevant energy scale (like, e.g., the energy per site). For
PðQ̂ ≈ qLÞ, we can simply take the projection of Q̂ on the
eigenvalue closest to qL. Then we can set
Z
ð5Þ
P ρ̂ ¼ de0 dqpρ̂ ðe0 ; qÞρ̂e0 ;q ;

PRETHERMALIZATION AND THERMALIZATION IN …
R
where de0 dq represents a sum with the aforementioned
resolution. We define P̄ ¼ 1 − P, and note that both P, P̄
are projectors, namely, P 2 ¼ P and P̄ 2 ¼ P̄. A warning is
in order, despite the fact that P ρ̂ and P̄ ρ̂ encode all the
information about the microscopic distributions of E0 and
Q (whose widths are expected to be subextensive in E0 and
Q [36]), all that information is not needed and our analysis
does not allow one to keep track of it in time. Our results
only depend on, and keep track of, the distribution of
densities pðe0 ; qÞ.
The above definition of the projection P is motivated by
ensembles of statistical mechanics, which are expected to
describe many-body quantum systems after equilibration.
An equivalent definition can be motivated purely from
quantum mechanics. If one takes ρ̂ and evolves it under the
unitary evolution dictated by Ĥ 0, observables equilibrate to
the predictions of the so-called diagonal ensemble ρ̂DE [22]:
X
ðhE0 jρ̂jE0 iÞjE0 ihE0 j;
ð6Þ
ρ̂DE ¼
E0

where jE0 i are the eigenkets Ĥ0 and Q̂, and we have
assumed that either there are no degeneracies in the
many-body energy spectrum or that, if present, they are
unimportant. This is generically the case in interacting
many-body quantum systems [22].
The map ρ̂ → ρ̂DE is a projection as well; let us call it
P DE . It provides an alternative path to identifying the slow
variables. This is the case because, in recent years, we have
come to realize that the ensembles defined by P ρ̂ and P DE ρ̂
are equivalent when it comes to their predictions for
observables (few-body or local operators) in large systems.
This is a consequence of eigenstate thermalization for
nonintegrable (quantum chaotic) systems [36–38], and
generalized eigenstate thermalization for integrable systems [17,20,39–41]. Hence, it does not really matter
whether one uses the projection P or P DE, so we do not
actively distinguish between them in most of our analytical
derivations. In our numerical calculations we use P DE , as
ρ̂DE can be calculated exactly in the same way for nonintegrable and integrable systems. P, on the other hand,
demands that one identifies beforehand the relevant conserved quantities (not necessary for P DE ). Keeping all this
is mind, in what follows we do not actively distinguish
between nonintegrable systems, for which the number of
conserved quantities in the thermodynamic limit is Oð1Þ,
from integrable systems, for which the number of conserved quantities in the thermodynamic limit is infinite.
B. Mori-Zwanzig approach
Let us introduce the Liouville superoperator L ¼ −i½Ĥ; ·.
Then, following Mori-Zwanzig [42,43], see Appendix A, the
theory of linear ordinary differential equations gives us the
following rewriting of the P-projected Liouville equation

where ρ̂I ≡ ρ̂ðτ ¼ 0Þ, and we use that the projector P is time

They follow from elementary considerations. This allows
one to recast the above equation of motion as

where we introduce

Appendix A):

It should be stressed that all the previous equations are exact,
and, hence, they are not particularly useful. In the next
section, we make some motivated approximations.
C. Equilibration
Our only assumption is that the dynamics generated
by Ĥ 0 results in fast equilibration of observables to the
equilibrium state that is characterized by the expectation
value of Ĥ0 , E0 ¼ Trðρ̂I Ĥ0 Þ, and of Q̂, Q ¼ Trðρ̂I Q̂Þ. Once
again, we stress that we do not distinguish between nonintegrable reference Hamiltonians Ĥ0 , for which observables
equilibrate to the thermal predictions (thermalize [22]), from
integrable reference Hamiltonians, for which observables
equilibrate to the GGE predictions (exhibit generalized

thermalization [17]). For our purposes, it does not matter
whether equilibration is towards a traditional ensemble of
statistical mechanics or towards a GGE: in both cases it
means that, for generic (few-body) observables Ô and initial
states ρ̂I ,
jTr½ρ̂I Ô0 ðτÞ − Tr½ρ̂e0 ;q Ôj
jTr½ρ̂e0 ;q Ôj

≕ fðτÞ → 0;

ð13Þ

where Ô0 ðτÞ ¼ eiτĤ0 Ôe−iτĤ0 . We define an equilibration
timescale τ ðϵÞ, which is understood as the time τ at which
fðτÞ ≈ ϵ for some small dimensionless ϵ. By fast equilibration, we mean that τ ðϵÞ ∼ Oð1Þ in the relevant time units of
the problem. In Sec. VI, numerical simulations of a translationally invariant one-dimensional Hamiltonian indeed
show that, in times that are Oð1Þ in the relevant timescale,
observables reach values that are very close to the predictions
of ρ̂e0 ;q .
We do not expect ϵ to be arbitrarily small because, even
if the Hamiltonian and the initial state are translational
invariant, the unavoidable coupling to hydrodynamic
modes in interacting systems renders the approach of local
observables to equilibrium polynomial, fðτÞ ∝ τ−d=2 , as
argued in Ref. [44] on the basis of fluctuating hydrodynamics. In such a case, one expects
τ ðϵÞ ≈ ϵ−2=d :

eτL0 ρ̂ ≈ PeτL0 ρ̂;

whenever τ > τ ;

ð15Þ

accepting an error OðϵÞ. This approximation amounts to
assuming that the system has equilibrated after a time τ
with respect to the dynamics generated by Ĥ0. Hence, at
time τ , we replace the density matrix of the system by
ρ̂e0 ;q . Of course, the usual caveats typical of irreversibility
apply: this replacement can only be correct when dealing
with local or few-body observables Ô, or sums thereof, not
for (special) many-body operators such as the spectral
projectors of Ĥ0 [22].
D. Born approximation
We can now state our main assumption as a weak
coupling condition, namely,
gτ ≪ 1:

0

Note that, for example, the first term on the rhs could also
be written as PL1 P̄esL0 P̄L1 P or even PL1 P̄esP̄L0 P̄ P̄L1 P,
which makes apparent that the intermediate evolution acts
on the fast degrees of freedom. In order for this expansion
in powers of g to be meaningful, one needs to make sure
that the series above can be resummed such that it is linear
in L. For example, since every L1 carries a factor L, it
appears that the first and second terms in the equation
above are of order L2 and L3 , respectively. However,
one can write these terms as sums of [and integrals
over ðe0 ; qÞ] truncated correlation functions hV̂ 0 ðsÞV̂ice0 ;q
and hV̂ 0 ðsÞV̂ 0 ðs1 ÞV̂ice0 ;q ; see, e.g., the remark following
Eq. (B4). These truncated correlation functions are of
order L due to clustering properties of the ðe0 ; qÞ equilibrium ensembles. In higher orders, such considerations
become more complicated and we refer the interested
reader to mathematical work establishing a meaningful
expansion [45,46]. Assuming that one recovers the linearity in L to all orders, for any τ ≥ τ,
Zτ

ð14Þ

Our numerical results suggest that, for the models and
observables studied, hydrodynamics tails may set in when ϵ
is very small, at times that are beyond the reach of our
numerical calculations.
The way τ enters our analysis is that we approximate,
for any ρ̂,

ð16Þ

To see this assumption at work, let us expand the
exponential esðL0 þP̄L1 Þ in the definition of As in Eq. (11):

ð17Þ

Zτ

dsPL1 esL0 L1 P þ Oðg3 τ2 LÞ; ð18Þ

dsAs ¼
0

0

where the first term is Oðg2 Lτ Þ. One then sees that the
expansion is meaningful if
g3 τ2 L ≪ g2 τ L;

ð19Þ

which is, of course, equivalent to Eq. (16).
E. Markov approximation
The discussion Rabove has shown that the lowest order
approximation to 0∞ dsAs , namely,
Z∞
K¼

dsPL1 esL0 L1 P;

ð20Þ

0

is Oðg2 τ LÞ, with the factor L originating from the spatial
sum in L1 . The physical meaning of this factor is that the
quantities that change smoothly in time are the densities
ðe0 ; qÞ rather than ðE0 ; QÞ themselves, or, alternatively,
local observables. We then see that the superoperator K is
Oðg2 τ Þ, and this is the rate at which ρ̂ changes. Recalling
that the time integral defining K reaches its τ ¼ ∞ value
at τ ≈ τ leads to the conclusion that, in Eq. (10), we can
approximate P ρ̂ðτ − sÞ by P ρ̂ðτÞ, making an error Oðg2 τ2 Þ

PRETHERMALIZATION AND THERMALIZATION IN …
(which is small by our weak-coupling assumption gτ ≪ 1).
A further simplification occurs by observing that Y τ is
proportional to g, and vanishes fast as τ ≥ τ , so one might
set Y τ ¼ 0 for times τ ≥ τ . If we make these two
approximations, then the equation of motion [Eq. (10)] reads
∂ τ P ρ̂ðτÞ ¼ KP ρ̂ðτÞ;

τ ≫ τ :

PHYS. REV. X 9, 021027 (2019)
∂ τ pτ ðe0 ; qÞ ¼ −d½e0 ; q∂ q pτ ðe0 ; qÞ;

ð24Þ

which lifts naturally to an evolution on P ρ̂. The stationary
solution of Eq. (23) as τ → ∞ is denoted by ðe0 ; q Þ, where
q ¼ q ðe0 Þ is determined by
d½e0 ; q ðe0 Þ ¼ 0:

ð21Þ

ð25Þ

A conservative look at the validity of Eq. (21), in particular
to the approximation Y τ ¼ 0, shows that one should trust
Eq. (21) only for times τ ≫ τtr (where the subindex tr stands
for transient) and τtr is determined by g2 τ ≫ gfðτtr Þ, as
follows by comparing the magnitude of the two terms in
Eq. (10).

Within Fermi’s golden rule [Eq. (22)], this is recognized
as a detailed balance condition, indicating that q ðe0 Þ is
the equilibrium value of q given e0 . In other words, q is
determined by maximizing the entropy at fixed e0 and,
hence, the resulting ensemble ρ̂e0 ;q is equivalent to one in
which no constraint on q̂ is imposed:

F. Autonomous equation

ρ̂e0 ;q ≈ ρ̂e0 :

The meaning of Eq. (21), in which K is a superoperator
acting on density matrices, is simplified by the presence of
P. As mentioned before, P projects onto distributions of
densities pðe0 ; qÞ, and so Eq. (21) is actually an evolution
equation on such p. It is easier, and more natural, to guess
the form of this evolution equation than to derive it from the
formula above, so we will do the former here and relegate
the latter to Appendix B.
Given ρ̂e0 ;q , we need to find the rate of change of ðe0 ; qÞ.
The natural path is to use Fermi’s golden rule, within which
e0 does not change in time. Having a single eigenket jE0 i in
mind, the rate of change of q, called the “drift” d, is given
by

ð22Þ

where QE0 ¼ hE0 jQ̂jE0 i, the integral is understood as a
sum, and the delta function δðE0 − Ē0 Þ selects an interval
of energies with a width smaller than any relevant energy
scale but much larger than the level spacing. In principle,
one should average dðE0 Þ over E0, with the distribution
provided by statistical mechanics ρ̂e0 ;q , or by quantum
mechanics, i.e., the diagonal ensemble ρ̂DE . However, once
again, because of eigenstate thermalization (or its generalized version for integrable systems), we expect the
average to be unnecessary for large L. Hence, the drift d ¼
dðe0 ; qÞ does not depend on jE0 i but only on ðe0 ; qÞ. Even
though V̂ ¼ OðLÞ, the drift dðe0 ; qÞ is Oð1Þ because of
decay of spatial correlations; see Appendix B. We then
obtain the autonomous equation
∂ τ qðτÞ ¼ d½e0 ðτÞ; qðτÞ;

∂ τ e0 ðτÞ ¼ 0:

This also shows that the asymptotic state ρ̂e0 ;q is close to
the global equilibrium state ρ̂e for which hĥi ¼ e ¼ e0 þ
OðgÞ. In Sec. IV, we quantify the OðgÞ difference between
ρ̂e0 ;q and ρ̂e .
G. Corrections
In principle, our scheme allows one to compute higherorder corrections in g to the autonomous Eqs. (21) and (23).
In particular, one can expand As in a power series in terms
of order ðgτ Þn L, n ≥ 1, with the terms for n ¼ 1 and 2
given in Sec. III D. Integrating over s, one then gets a series
for K, and hence for the drift coefficient d½e0 ; q. It is,
however, far from obvious that such corrections are useful,
as (i) we have made approximations at several points, not
only in truncating As , but also, e.g., replacing P ρ̂ðτ − sÞ for
s ≤ τ by P ρ̂ðτÞ, and (ii) a not-so-fast decay of fðτÞ would
imply that the Y τ term in Eq. (10) remains potentially
important at long times, obscuring any precise corrections
to the Markovian part.
Rigorous work in the context of open quantum systems
[45–47] implies that one can meaningfully
compute corR
rections, but only if the condition 0∞ dτjfðτÞj < ∞ is
satisfied.
IV. DYNAMICS OF LOCAL OBSERVABLES
So far, we have focused on the evolution of the
quasiconserved quantity Q̂, which we found to be described
by the autonomous Eq. (23). We now turn our attention to
more general observables. Our main finding is that their
time-dependent expectation values are described by a
“deformed equilibrium ensemble,” with an OðgÞ difference
from ρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ . This deviation has a universal form.

At first sight, the evolution of generic observables is
slaved by the evolution of the slow variables ðe0 ; qÞ.
Indeed, the general picture is that the evolution of the

density matrix ρ̂ðτÞ takes place in the space of equilibrium
density matrices ρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ , leading to the prediction
Tr½ρ̂ðτÞÔ ≈ Tr½ÔP ρ̂ðτÞ ¼ hÔie0 ;qðτÞ :

ð27Þ

In the last equality, we assumed that pðe0 ; qÞ is concentrated at a single value. Yet, strictly speaking, the previous
section dealt with P ρ̂ðτÞ, rather than with ρ̂ðτÞ, so Eq. (27)
is in need of a justification. To provide it, we return to the
formalism in Sec. III B, and write [see Eq. (12)]
ρ̂ðτÞ ¼ P ρ̂ðτÞ þ P̄ ρ̂ðτÞ
¼ P ρ̂ðτÞ þ eτP̄L P̄ ρ̂I þ

dsP̄esP̄L LP ρ̂ðτ − sÞ:

The first term in Eq. (28) is dominant for large τ ≥ τtr .
It amounts to the approximation resulting in Eq. (27).
The second term in the last line of Eq. (28) is transient,
decaying as gfðτÞ, as discussed also in Sec. III E. The third
term is the correction we are interested in. Let us write
it explicitly, when paired with an observable Ô, namely,
Rτ

by maximizing the entropy at fixed e0 . The ensemble ρ̂e0 ;q
is a small perturbation of the real equilibrium ensemble ρ̂e
corresponding to Ĥ, with hĥiρ̂e ¼ hĥiρ̂e ;q þ OðgÞ. We can
0
relate these two ensembles by linear response theory.
Indeed, we can imagine starting with ρ̂e0 ;q at τ ¼ 0, and
switching on the perturbation gV̂. The system will then
evolve precisely to ρ̂e , and the change in the expectation
value of observables Ô should be described by linear
response theory. In particular, the stationary change is
described by the zero-frequency response coefficient (also
known as the susceptibility), which is exactly Eq. (30).
This discussion should also clarify how thermalization
with respect to Ĥ is reconciled with our treatment, which is
based on equilibration with respect to Ĥ0 . The global
equilibrium state ρ̂e is obtained as a universal correction to
the state ρ̂e0 ;q .
C. Deformed equilibrium ensembles from
Fermi’s golden rule
In Sec. IVA, we use the last term in Eq. (28) to derive the
OðgÞ correction to observables in ρ̂ðτÞ from their expectation values in ρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ . Here, we point out that this is also
what the autonomous Eq. (23) dictates.
Let us compute the time derivative of qðτÞ:

One can further simplify this expression by approximating
P ρ̂ðτ − sÞ by P ρ̂ðτÞ, justified by the reasoning in
Sec. III E, and by again assuming that the distribution
pðe0 ; qÞ, corresponding to P ρ̂ðτÞ, is concentrated at a
single density ½e0 ; qðτÞ. Then the last line in Eq. (29) reads

By the assumption of fast equilibration at s ≈ τ , this
expression is Oðgτ Þ; i.e., it is a small correction to
hÔie0 ;qðτÞ . Even though it is subleading, this correction
has a universal form, as we explain in the next section.
Finally, note that Eq. (30), obtained following a naive firstorder perturbation theory, was already written in Sec. II for
Q̂ [see Eq. (2)]. In that case, the s-independent integrand
vanishes identically.

ð31Þ

where, in the last equality, we use that ½Ĥ0 ; Q̂ ¼ 0.
Previously, we evaluated this time derivative in a different
way: we approximated ρ̂ðτÞ by ρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ [assuming, again,
that pðe0 ; qÞ is a Dirac delta function] and we arrived at
∂ τ qðτÞ ¼ Tr½q̂Kρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ :

ð32Þ

This is a more abstract rendering of the autonomous
Eq. (23). At this point, one can ask which form of ρ̂ðτÞ
would reconcile Eqs. (31) and (32). By the cyclic property
of the trace, and using that ½q̂; ρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ  ¼ 0, we note that
Eq. (31) does not depend on the leading contribution ρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ
to ρ̂ðτÞ. It depends only on the correction term. We then see
that Eq. (31) reduces to Eq. (32) if we choose the correction
term to be
Z∞
dsP̄esL0 L1 ρ̂e0 ;qðτÞ ;

ð33Þ

0

which is the correction we used in Sec. IVA to derive
Eq. (30). A spectacular corollary of this reasoning is the
observation that, if ρ̂ðτÞ were exactly commuting with q̂,
then the rate of change vanishes, i.e., ∂ τ qðτÞ ¼ 0.

B. Susceptibility
To understand the correction in Eq. (30), consider the
equilibrium ensemble ρ̂e0 ;q with ðe0 ; q Þ the τ → ∞
solution of Eq. (23), or, alternatively, with q determined

V. MODELS, QUENCHES, AND OBSERVABLES
In the rest of the paper, we test the previous ideas and
analytical results in numerical experiments. We focus on

PRETHERMALIZATION AND THERMALIZATION IN …
the dynamics of nonintegrable models of strongly interacting hard-core bosons in one-dimensional lattices (which
can be mapped onto spin-1=2 Hamiltonians). We study the
effects of breaking particle-number conservation [the U(1)
symmetry in the corresponding spin models].
A. Models
Quantum dynamics are studied under time-independent
Hamiltonians Ĥα of the form
Ĥ α ¼ Ĥ0 þ gα V̂ α ;

ð34Þ

where the reference Hamiltonian Ĥ0 , which we take to be
nonintegrable, commutes with the total particle-number
operator N̂, ½Ĥ 0 ; N̂ ¼ 0. The perturbations, gα V̂ α , do not
commute with N̂, ½V̂ α ; N̂ ≠ 0.
We take Ĥ0 to be the t-V-t0 -V 0 Hamiltonian for hard-core
bosons in 1D lattices [48,49], with nearest (next-nearest)
neighbor hopping t (t0 ) and interaction V (V 0 ):

where b̂†i ðb̂i Þ is the hard-core boson creation (annihilation)
operator and n̂i ¼ b̂†i b̂i is the number operator at site i.
When t0 ¼ V 0 ¼ 0, Ĥ0 is integrable (in the spin language, it
is the Hamiltonian of the spin-1=2 XXZ chain) [50]. Here,
we focus on cases in which t0 ¼ V 0 ≠ 0, so that Ĥ0 is
nonintegrable [48,49].
We consider two perturbations gα V̂ α , with α ¼ 1, 2.

It will be important later that the presence of nearest

typical eigenkets jE0i i of Ĥ0 .

This perturbation only contains terms that change the
particle number. Hence, hE0i jV̂ 2 jE0i i ¼ 0 for all eigenkets
jE0i i of Ĥ0 and N̂.
B. Initial states and description after equilibration
We study the quantum dynamics of initial states ρ̂I that
are far from equilibrium with respect to both Ĥ 0 and Ĥα .
This is achieved by choosing ρ̂I to be thermal equilibrium

PHYS. REV. X 9, 021027 (2019)
states of initial Hamiltonians ĤI , such that ½ĤI ; Ĥα  ≠ 0
and ½Ĥ I ; Ĥ0  ≠ 0. Dynamics are generated by quantum
quenches in which, at time τ ¼ 0, one suddenly changes
ĤI → Ĥα and lets the system evolve unitarily. We consider
systems that are translationally invariant before and after
the quench.
The time-evolving density matrix after the quench can be
written as ρ̂ðτÞ ¼ e−iĤα τ ρ̂I eiĤα τ . We are interested in the
dynamics of observables Ô, whose expectation values are
given by OðτÞ ¼ Tr½ρ̂ðτÞÔ. At long times, one expects
observables to equilibrate at the values predicted by the
diagonal ensemble (DE), ODE ¼ Tr½ρ̂DE Ô, where ρ̂DE ¼
R 0

jEαi i of Ĥα , ρ̂DE takes the form

For nonintegrable (quantum chaotic) systems, because of
eigenstate thermalization [36–38], one expects the predictions of the diagonal ensemble to match those of traditional
statistical mechanics ensembles; namely, we expect observables to thermalize [22]. For the t-V-t0 -V 0 Hamiltonian for
hard-core bosons in 1D lattices, eigenstate thermalization
and thermalization were studied in Ref. [48], while quantum chaos was studied in Ref. [49]. This means that, in our
systems, we can also describe observables after equilibration by means of the grand canonical ensemble (GE)
characterized by a temperature T, and, when particle
number is a conserved quantity, by a chemical potential
μ. The grand canonical ensemble density matrices have the

energy [Eq. (40)] and by the (conserved) particle number in
the time-evolving state,
Tr½ρ̂GE N̂ ¼ Tr½ρ̂I N̂:

ð41Þ

Because of particle-hole symmetry in the Hamiltonians
Ĥα , when gα ≠ 0 (namely, in the absence of particlenumber conservation), our systems after equilibration are
always at half filling irrespective of the initial filling nI .
We consider initial fillings nI ≠ 1=2, which means that the
filling must change during the dynamics when gα ≠ 0.

PHYS. REV. X 9, 021027 (2019)

From our analysis in the previous sections, we expect that,
for small values of gα , the dynamics of generic observables
follow a two-step process towards thermalization: (i) fast
relaxation driven by Ĥ0 (prethermal dynamics) and
(ii) slower, nearly exponential, relaxation to the thermal
equilibrium predictions (thermalization dynamics). At long
times, close to thermal equilibrium, hydrodynamics may
become dominant and algebraic relaxation is expected to
take place [44]. That regime is not resolved in this work.
As discussed in Sec. IV, the near-exponential dynamics
following prethermalization can be described by projecting
ρ̂ðτÞ in the basis of the eigenkets of Ĥ0 , up to an OðgÞ
correction. This projected state is a diagonal ensemble of
Ĥ0 , whose density matrix [see Eq. (6)] we denote as
X
ðhE0i jρ̂ðτÞjE0i iÞjE0i ihE0i j; ð42Þ
ρ̂0 ðτÞ ≡ P DE ρ̂ðτÞ ¼

(our initial states are in thermal equilibrium with respect to
ĤI ). In all quenches, we take ĤI to be the t-t0 -V-V 0 model
in Eq. (35). Since ½ĤcI ; N̂ c  ¼ 0, where N̂ c is the total
particle number operator in the cluster,

C. Numerical linked cluster expansion (NLCE)
In what follows, we use the numerical linked cluster
expansion (NLCE) approach introduced in Ref. [23] (see
Refs. [51,52] for NLCE studies in two dimensions) to study
the quantum dynamics of various observables in our
translationally invariant 1D systems in the thermodynamic
limit.
NLCEs were originally introduced to study systems
in thermal equilibrium [53], and allow one to obtain
the expectation value of extensive observables per site
(O ¼ O=L), in the thermodynamic limit (L → ∞), as sums
over the contributions of the connected clusters that can be
embedded in the lattice. Given the connected clusters c,
which can be embedded in the lattice in MðcÞ ways per site
and have weights W O ðcÞ, one obtains O in the following
way
X
O¼
MðcÞ × W O ðcÞ:
ð43Þ
c

W O ðcÞ is computed, for each cluster c, from the expectation
value of the observable Ô in the cluster (Oc ) using the
inclusion exclusion principle:
X
W O ðcÞ ¼ Oc −
W O ðsÞ;
ð44Þ
s⊂c

where the sum is over all connected subclusters of c.
For the smallest cluster, W O ðcÞ ¼ Oc . For each cluster,
Oc ¼ Tr½ρ̂c Ô, where ρ̂c is the density matrix of the
relevant ensemble in the cluster. In NLCEs, Oc is calculated
exactly numerically using full exact diagonalization.
In our calculations, the density matrix of the initial state
in each cluster ρ̂cI is taken to be the grand canonical density
matrix set by the initial Hamiltonian in each cluster ĤcI

c

Tr½e−ðĤI þμI N̂ Þ=T I 
c

c

:

ð45Þ

Also, since ĤcI is particle-hole symmetric, we need μI ≠ 0
in order to have initial states with filling nI ≠ 1=2.
To calculate the time evolution of the expectation values
of the observables OðτÞ, where τ denotes the time after the
quench, the density matrix of each cluster is evolved with
the Hamiltonian after the quench Ĥ cα ,
ρ̂c ðτÞ ¼ ðe−iĤα τ Þρ̂cI ðeiĤα τ Þ;
c

where jE0i i are the eigenkets of Ĥ0 .

e−ðĤI þμI N̂ Þ=T I
c

ρ̂cI ¼

ð46Þ

and the NLCE calculation is carried out as usual [23]. Our
Hamiltonians after the quench have the form in Eq. (34).
Similarly, in order to obtain NLCE results after the quench
for the diagonal ensemble, the grand canonical ensemble,
and in the projected basis of Ĥ0 , we use ρ̂cDE , ρ̂cGE , and
ρ̂c0 ðτÞ from Eqs. (38), (39), and (42), respectively, for each
cluster c.
NLCEs have been used to study quenches in the
t-t0 -V-V 0 model [Eq. (35)] to understand the dynamics
[23], and the description of observables after equilibration
[54], at the integrable point t0 ¼ V 0 ¼ 0 and away from it
t0 ¼ V 0 ≠ 0. The presence of next-nearest neighbor hoppings and interactions makes it possible to have different
building blocks to construct the clusters in the NLCE.
In Ref. [55], it was shown that maximally connected
clusters—built adding contiguous sites and all possible
bonds, starting from one site—are optimal for studying
quenches in this model. Here, as in Refs. [23,54], we use
that NLCE in our calculations (there is only one maximally
connected cluster with a given number of sites). The
number of sites in the largest cluster considered defines
the order of NLCE, and we denote the value of an
observable OðτÞ evaluated with NLCE to order l as Ol ðτÞ.
D. Observables
We study three observables which have properties that
make them qualitatively distinct in the context of dynamics
and description after equilibration.
The first observable is the total particle number,
NðτÞ ¼ Tr½ρ̂ðτÞN̂;

ð47Þ

whose value per site, the particle filling, is denoted as nðτÞ.
This is a conserved quantity with respect to the reference
Hamiltonian Ĥ0 ; i.e., it only changes during dynamics
under Ĥ α after the quench if gα ≠ 0.

021027-8

PRETHERMALIZATION AND THERMALIZATION IN …
The second observable is the one-body nearest neighbor
correlation,
KðτÞ ¼ Tr½ρ̂ðτÞK̂;
whose value per site is denoted as kðτÞ, where

ðb̂†i b̂iþ1 þ b̂†iþ1 b̂i Þ:
K̂ ¼

ð48Þ

ð49Þ

PHYS. REV. X 9, 021027 (2019)
sector that needs to be diagonalized is 46 252). For mk ðτÞ,
the NLCE is carried out to one order lower than for nðτÞ
and kðτÞ, namely, up to the 16th order for gα ≠ 0 and up to
the 18th order for gα ¼ 0. This is because of the overhead
generated by the calculation of the dynamics of all the
matrix elements of the one-body density matrix [see
Eqs. (50) and (51)].

i

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS

kðτÞ is a local observable, closely related to the kinetic
energy per site. It changes during the dynamics independently of whether N̂ is conserved or not.
The third observable is the distribution function,
M k ðτÞ ¼ Tr½ρ̂ðτÞM̂ k ;

ð50Þ

whose value per site is the momentum distribution function,
denoted as mk ðτÞ. M̂k is the unnormalized (to make each k
component extensive) Fourier transform of the one-body
density matrix, given by
X
0
M̂k ¼
eikðj−j Þ b̂†j b̂j0 :
ð51Þ
j;j0

mk ðτÞ is a nonlocal one-body observable that changes
during the dynamics independently of whether N̂ is
conserved or not. This observable is of particular interest
because it is regularly measured (using time-of-flight
expansion) in experiments with ultracold quantum gases
[56]. mk ðτÞ was the observable used in Ref. [2] to show
lack of thermalization in 1D Bose gases with contact
interactions, and in Ref. [6] to study prethermalization
and thermalization 1D Bose gases with dipolar interactions.
E. Parameters used in the calculations
The initial state is taken to be a thermal equilibrium state
at temperature T I ¼ 10 and chemical potential μI ¼ 2
(similar results are obtained for other values of T I , not
too low, and μI ), for an initial Hamiltonian ĤI with nearest
and next-nearest neighbor coupling parameters tI ¼ 0.5,
V I ¼ 1.5, and t0I ¼ V 0I ¼ 0.7. After the quench, Ĥ α has
coupling parameters t ¼ V ¼ 1 (these set the energy scale
in our calculations), t0 ¼ V 0 ¼ 0.7, and gα ∈ ð0; 0.12Þ. For
these parameters after the quench, Ĥ 0 [48,49] and Ĥ α are
quantum chaotic and the system thermalizes for all values
of gα (see Ref. [23] for a NLCE study of the quench
dynamics when gα ¼ 0).
For nðτÞ and kðτÞ, we carry out the NLCE up to the 17th
order for quenches with gα ≠ 0 (the largest Hamiltonian
sector that needs to be diagonalized has 65 792 states after
exploiting reflection symmetry), and, thanks to particle
number conservation, up to the 19th order for quenches
with gα ¼ 0 (the dimension of the largest Hamiltonian

A. Dynamics of the particle filling
In Fig. 1(a), we show the evolution of the particle filling
under Ĥ 1 for three values of g1 . Results are shown for the
last two orders of the NLCE up to τ ¼ 100. In those
quenches, we expect the convergence errors for nðτÞ to be
below 0.01% for times τ ≲ 4, and to remain low (below
1%) up to times τ ≈ 16 (see Appendix C). For τ ≳ 16, the
results for the last two orders of the NLCE can be seen to
(slightly) deviate from each other in Fig. 1(a). In all the
plots in Fig. 1(a), nðτÞ can be seen to approach nDE ¼ 1=2.
For g1 ¼ 0.12, nðτ ¼ 100Þ ≈ nDE .
The approach of nðτÞ to nDE ¼ 0.5 is exponential. This is
apparent in Fig. 1(b), where we plot the normalized
“distance” to equilibrium:

the interval τ ∈ ½1; 6 for l ¼ 16. The rates obtained in those
calculations are shown in Fig. 1(c), as NLCE-17 and
NLCE-16, respectively. They agree with each other within
the errors of the fits. This suggests that our calculation
of ΓNLCE ðg1 Þ is robust. A power-law fit to the rates obtained
for l ¼ 17 is also shown in Fig. 1(c). We find that
ΓNLCE
ðg1 Þ ∝ gβ1 with β ¼ 1.99, in agreement with the
17
analytical results in Sec. III.
_
In closing Sec. IV C, we argued that the rate qðτÞ
¼0
whenever the state ρ̂ðτÞ commutes exactly with Q̂. The rate
also vanishes if ρ̂ðτÞ is time-reversal invariant about τ.
Both conditions apply to our initial states ρ̂I . As a result,
there is a narrow plateau in nðτÞ for τ ≤ 1. This plateau is
best seen in Fig. 9. This is why, to obtain the rates reported
in Fig. 1(c), we fit nðτÞ at times τ ≥ 1.
Next, we show that the values obtained for ΓNLCE ðg1 Þ are
in agreement with the ones predicted by Fermi’s golden
rule. From Eq. (22), changing Q̂ → N̂ and V̂ → V̂ α , one

correlation
Next, we study the dynamics of the one-body nearest
neighbor correlation, kðτÞ [see Eq. (49)]. In contrast to the
particle filling studied in Sec. VI A, the nearest neighbor
correlation kðτÞ exhibits dynamics even if gα ¼ 0 after the
quench.

ΓFermi ðgα Þ are done using full exact diagonalization in

which the results for ΓFermi ðgα Þ are robust against the choice
of ΔE, τ, and L (see Appendix D).

for quenches Ĥ I → Ĥ2 , Eq. (53) predicts the same leading

The results of both orders are in excellent agreement with
each other, and equilibrate rapidly to the prediction of
the diagonal ensemble (horizontal dashed line). The
predictions of the diagonal and grand canonical (horizontal contiguous line) ensembles are very close to each other,
indicating thermalization. This is expected because Ĥ0
after the quench is nonintegrable. The small difference
between the diagonal and the grand canonical ensemble
results is due to the lack of convergence of the NLCE
for the former (the latter is fully converged) [54]. Those
differences decrease with increasing the order of the
NLCE. In what follows, we use the grand canonical
ensemble predictions to probe thermalization.
In Fig. 3, we show kðτÞ after quenches ĤI → Ĥ1 (lefthand panels) and ĤI → Ĥ2 (right-hand panels). The dynamics are qualitatively similar in both cases. They can be split
in two regimes: (i) fast (prethermal) dynamics driven by Ĥ0
(note that, at times τ ≲ 10, dynamics in Fig. 3 are nearly
identical to those in Fig. 2) and (ii) a slower (thermalization)
dynamics controlled by the strength of the perturbation.
During the latter regime, the system approaches [and reaches
for g1 ¼ g2 ¼ 0.12 and τ ¼ 100, see Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)] the
prediction of the grand canonical ensemble ρ̂GE corresponding to Ĥα after the quench (with the temperature set by the
initial state).

ð55Þ

The chemical potential in ρ̂GE0 is μ0 ¼ 0 because, for
gα ≠ 0, the systems after equilibration are at half filling.
In the left-hand panels in Fig. 3, for quenches ĤI → Ĥ 1 ,
one can see the advanced offsets (see Sec. IV) between the
dynamics and the projected dynamics. The offsets are much
smaller for quenches ĤI → Ĥ2 , whose results are shown in
the right-hand panels in Fig. 3. The offsets between the
actual and projected dynamics remain constant at long
times and are, essentially, the difference between the
predictions of ρ̂GE and ρ̂GE0 .
The difference in the offsets generated by quenches
ĤI → Ĥ1 and ĤI → Ĥ 2 can be understood using Eq. (30),
replacing Ô → K̂ [K̂ is defined in Eq. (49)] and V̂ → V̂ α .
Since K̂ and ρ̂0 ðτÞ [ρ̂0 ðτÞ is defined in Eq. (42)] are block
diagonal in the particle number basis, only the presence of
terms in V̂ α that do not change the particle number can
produce an OðgÞ correction. Such terms are present in V̂ 1
(the hopping terms), see Eq. (36), but are absent in V̂ 2 , see
Eq. (37). This means that, to leading order, Δk1 ðτÞ ∝ g1
while Δk2 ðτÞ ∝ gβ2 with β ≥ 2.
In Fig. 4, we show the long-time offsets between the
actual and projected dynamics as functions of gα (for
positive and negative values of gα ) in the quenches
ĤI → Ĥ1 [Fig. 4(a)] and Ĥ I → Ĥ2 [Fig. 4(b)]. The offsets
are computed as the difference between the predictions of
ρ̂GE and ρ̂GE0 for the equilibrated results (see the horizontal
lines in Fig. 3). Those predictions are converged to machine
precision in the 17th order of the NLCE shown in Fig. 4.
Figure 4(a), for quenches ĤI → Ĥ1 , makes apparent the
presence of a leading linear correction and of a subleading
quadratic one. Figure 4(b) shows the absence of the linear
correction for quenches ĤI → Ĥ 2 . There, the leading
correction is quadratic, and our numerical results allow
us to identify a subleading cubic correction, which leads to
a weak asymmetry about g2 ¼ 0.
Comparing the results reported in Fig. 1(a), and in
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), for g1 ¼ 0.06 and 0.12, it becomes
apparent that kðτÞ equilibrates (reaches the long-time
horizontal line prediction) faster than nðτÞ. This can be
understood to be the result of the one-body nearest
neighbor correlation being particle-hole symmetric

C. Dynamics of the momentum distribution
Here, we study the dynamics of the momentum distribution function mk ðτÞ [Eq. (50)] for quenches ĤI → Ĥ 1 .
Similar to the dynamics of kðτÞ, the evolution of mk ðτÞ can
be split into a fast prethermalization dynamics and a slower
relaxation to the thermal equilibrium prediction at a rate
controlled by the strength of the perturbation.
In Fig. 5, we show results for the 15th (NLCE-15) and
16th (NLCE-16) orders of the NLCE for mk ðτÞ at four
times (τ ¼ 0, 2, 10, and 100) after quenches in which g1 ¼
0.03 (left-hand panels in Fig. 5) and g1 ¼ 0.12 (right-hand
panels in Fig. 5). In all panels in Fig. 5, we also show
results for the 15th (NLCE-15) and 16th (NLCE-16) orders
of the NLCE for the projected dynamics of mk ðτÞ in the
basis of Ĥ 0 [the dynamics dictated by ρ̂0 ðτÞ, see Eq. (42)].
Figures 5(b) and 5(f) show that the momentum distribution
in the original and projected dynamics become nearly
indistinguishable from each other after short times (τ ≳ 2),

(as the Hamiltonians Ĥα are). This means that, close to

and remain so at long times [see Figs. 5(c), 5(d), 5(g),

In Figs. 5(d) and 5(h), we also show the 16th order
NLCE prediction of the diagonal and the grand canonical
ensembles for the long-time dynamics, and of the grand
canonical ensemble for the long-time projected dynamics
[see Eq. (55) and the discussion surrounding this equation].
For g1 ¼ 0.03 [Fig. 5(d)], the results of the three equilibrium ensembles are nearly indistinguishable from each
other. They differ from those of the dynamics at τ ¼ 100
(they all become nearly indistinguishable from each other
at later times). For g1 ¼ 0.12 [Fig. 5(h)], the results for the
three equilibrium ensembles and for the dynamics at τ ¼
100 agree with each other. This, in contrast to the results

and τ (see Appendix D).

for g1 ¼ 0.03, makes apparent that mk ðτÞ thermalizes faster
with increasing the magnitude of g1 (as expected). Also, as
expected from our discussion in Sec. IV and for kðτÞ in
Sec. VI B (see Fig. 3), there is an Oðg1 Þ offset between the
results for mk ðτÞ in the dynamics and in the projected
dynamics. The magnitude of this offset is momentum
dependent, as made apparent by the inset in Fig. 5(d),
and is too small to be resolved at the scales used in the main
panels of Fig. 5.
The operator corresponding to the momentum distribution function, unlike the one for the one-body nearest
neighbor correlation, is not particle-hole symmetric. This

interacting integrable systems in which integrability is
weakly broken, as well as to nonintegrable systems in
which a conservation law is weakly broken. The weak
perturbation allows the system to equilibrate to a state that
is a (generalized) thermal equilibrium state of the unperturbed system. The properties of such a state are determined
by the slowly changing value of the quasiconserved
quantity (or quantities). The separation of timescales leads
to a universal description, two aspects of which stand out.
(i) The dynamics of the (or each) quasiconserved quantity is described by an autonomous equation that can
be constructed from Fermi’s golden rule in unperturbed equilibrium ensembles. This equation is the
generalization of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation
appearing in weakly interacting quantum systems.
(ii) The deviation of observables in the instantaneous
state from the prediction of the unperturbed equilibrium ensemble is described by first-order perturbation theory. This generalizes the concept of
“deformed GGE” that was described in Ref. [12]
for integrable systems in the presence of a weak
integrability-breaking perturbation.
Our theoretical results, as well as several special behaviors related to the initial state selected, properties of the
perturbations that break the conservation law, and properties of the observables studied, were validated by numerical
experiments in systems for which both the reference and
the perturbed dynamics are nonintegrable.
A systematic study of integrable systems in which
integrability is weakly broken is beyond the scope of this
work. As mentioned in the Introduction, noninteracting
systems in the presence of weak integrability-breaking
interactions were studied in Refs. [7–15]. There have also
been studies of integrable systems mappable onto noninteracting ones in the presence of an integrability-breaking
perturbation [57]. For a strongly interacting integrable
system, Ĥ0 in Eq. (35) with t ¼ V ¼ 1 and t0 ¼ V 0 ¼ 0
(which is not mappable onto a noninteracting model), in
Ref. [23] it was shown numerically that weakly breaking
integrability by making g ≡ t0 ¼ V 0 ≠ 0 results in thermalization rates ∝ g2 .
To check the applicability of our theory to strongly
interacting integrable reference dynamics, in Fig. 7 we
show results for dynamics under the same reference
Hamiltonian as in Ref. [23] when one breaks integrability
with the perturbation g2 V̂ 2 in Eq. (37). Those results are the
equivalent of results reported in Figs. 1 and 3, for quenches
ĤI → Ĥ2 in which t0I ¼ V 0I ¼ 0 in ĤI and t0 ¼ V 0 ¼ 0 in
Ĥ2 . The main panel in Fig. 7 shows that the thermalization
rate for the particle filling is ∝ g22 , and that it agrees with the
Fermi golden rule prediction [see Eqs. (53) and (54)] for
small values of g2 . The upper inset in Fig. 7 shows that the
particle filling approaches exponentially its thermal equilibrium value, as seen in Fig. 1(b) for the nonintegrable
reference dynamics. The lower inset in Fig. 7 shows the

of kðτÞ for g2 ¼ 0.12. They are in excellent agreement with
each other, like in Fig. 3(d) for the nonintegrable reference
dynamics. In short, there are no qualitative differences
between the results reported in Figs. 1 and 3 for the
nonintegrable reference dynamics and in Fig. 7 for the
integrable reference dynamics.
We should stress that all our numerical results for the
projected dynamics were obtained within the diagonal
ensemble, which allowed us to study indistinctively quantum
chaotic reference dynamics in Sec. VI, and strongly interacting integrable reference dynamics in Fig. 7. However,
because of eigenstate thermalization in quantum chaotic
systems, and its generalized version in integrable systems,
one can equally well use traditional ensembles of statistical
mechanics for the projected dynamics when the reference
dynamics is quantum chaotic [22] and generalized Gibbs

To stress the algebra of the problem, we use a notation

in total there are four terms, depending on whether gV̂ in
each L1 term acts on the left or on the right. We decompose
ðB2Þ

where the “gain” operator contains the two cases in which
the V̂’s act on different sides, and the “loss” operator
contains the two cases in which they act on the same side.
For both operators, we can recast the two cases into a
single formula by extending the integration range of s from
½0; ∞Þ to ð−∞; ∞Þ. One then has that

canceled out in the commutators [alternatively, it would
cancel between Eqs. (B3) and (B4)]. For this reason, we can
replace all correlation functions below by truncated correlation functions.
Recall that we identified the space of P ρ̂ with distributions p on ðe0 ; qÞ. Indeed, any P ρ̂ is of the form ρ̂p with

operator, we see that also V̂ δQ is a sum of local terms. In
that case Eq. (B7) is manifestly of order OðLÞ, as a
truncated correlation function in equilibrium. The first
term in Eq. (B6) can be written as

with e00 ¼ e0 and q0 − q ¼ δQ=L. Indeed, the condition
e00 ¼ e0 is enforced by the integral over s. The second term
in Eq. (B6) has a contribution at e0 ¼ e00 , q ¼ q0 only (by
the cyclic property of the trace, the projector P̂e00 ;q0 is put
next to the density matrix ρ̂e0 ;q ), and its value is

All the numerical results reported in the main text, but the
relaxation rates ΓFermi computed using Fermi’s golden rule
and full exact diagonalization, were obtained using NLCE
calculations. The basics of NLCEs was summarized in
Sec. V C, and relevant parameters for the NLCE calculations
(orders, largest Hilbert spaces involved, etc.) were mentioned in Sec. V E. Here we discuss the convergence of the
NLCE calculations and finite-size effects in the full exact
diagonalization calculations.
All our full exact diagonalization calculations are
carried out in chains with periodic boundary conditions.
We use translational symmetry to block diagonalize the
Hamiltonian, which allows us to study larger chains than
within the NLCE calculations. In the exact diagonalization calculations when gα ≠ 0, in the absence of particlenumber conservation, the largest Hamiltonian sector
diagonalized has 14 602 states (for L ¼ 18). When
gα ¼ 0, in the presence of particle-number conservation,
the largest Hamiltonian sector diagonalized has 9252
states (for L ¼ 20). We only report exact diagonalization
results for gα ¼ 0 in Fig. 11(a). The matrices involved
in our full exact diagonalization calculations are complex
for sectors with total quasimomentum k ≠ 0 and π, and
the results reported contain the contribution from all L
quasimomentum sectors.
In Fig. 9, we show the evolution of the particle filling
nðτÞ for g1 ¼ 0.12 (the fastest changing case studied) as
obtained in the last four orders of the NLCE, and in the
three largest chains solved using full exact diagonalization.
In the scale of the figure, all the results are nearly
indistinguishable from each other up to τ ≈ 10. Beyond
that time, but not too far from it, the NLCE results can be
seen to oscillate in the order of the expansion, even orders
of the NLCE are above the odd orders (see the inset in
Fig. 9). With increasing the order of the NLCE, one finds
that the amplitude of the oscillation decreases and the
results converge at longer times. This is similar to what

happens in thermal equilibrium calculations, in which the
NLCEs converge at lower temperatures as one increases
the order of the expansion [53]. The exact diagonalization
results, on the other hand, can be seen to approach the
NLCE ones monotonically with increasing the chain size.
In Fig. 9, the nðτÞ results in the last order of the NLCE and
in the largest periodic chain diagonalized are nearly
indistinguishable up to τ ≈ 20.
To gain a more quantitative understanding of the convergence of the particle filling nl ðτÞ calculations within
NLCE, where l is the order of the expansion, and of finitesize effects in the exact diagonalization (ED) calculations
of nL ðτÞ, where L is the chain size, we compute the relative
differences,

FIG. 10. Relative differences, defined in Eqs. (C1)–(C3), for
g1 ¼ 0.12. The exact diagonalization results are obtained in
chains with periodic boundary conditions.

In Fig. 10, we plot the relative differences defined in
Eqs. (C1) and (C2) for l ¼ 15 and 16 of the NLCE, and for
L ¼ 16 and 17 in the exact diagonalization calculations,
also for g1 ¼ 0.12 as in Fig. 9. Some points to be highlighted from the plots in Fig. 10 are the following: (i) the
NLCE results for l ¼ 16 are likely converged within
machine precision up to τ ≈ 2, while the exact diagonalization ones for L ¼ 17 are likely converged within
machine precision only up to about one half of that time
(τ ≈ 1); (ii) the relative differences between the various
orders of the NLCE and between the various exact
diagonalization calculations are below 0.01% for τ ≲ 4;
(iii) at times τ ≈ 16, the relative differences are in all cases
below 2% (they are smaller between the exact diagonalization results than between the NLCE ones).
The results for the relative difference ΔNLCE-ED ½nðτÞ are
qualitatively similar to those for ΔNLCE
½nðτÞ and ΔED
L ½nðτÞ.
l
We find that ΔNLCE-ED ½nðτÞ ≤ 0.01% for times τ ≤ 5. We
use times τ ≤ 5 for the exact diagonalization calculation of
the rates from Fermi’s golden rule in Appendix D. We also
find that ΔNLCE-ED ½nðτÞ ≲ 0.5% for times τ ≤ 16. We use
times τ ≤ 16 in the fits to obtain the rates from the 17th order
of the NLCE dynamics in Sec. VI B.
Next, for the one-body nearest neighbor correlations
kðτÞ, we discuss the convergence of the NLCE calculations
kl ðτÞ and finite-size effects in the full exact diagonalization
calculations kL ðτÞ. kðτÞ, being a correlation function, is
more challenging to obtain accurately than nðτÞ, which is a
thermodynamic quantity.
In Fig. 11(a), we show dynamics after the quench
ĤI → Ĥ0 for kl ðτÞ with l ¼ 17, 18, and 19 (the latter two
are also reported in Fig. 2) and for kL ðτÞ with L ¼ 18, 19,
and 20. kl ðτÞ and kL ðτÞ are almost indistinguishable from
each other up to times τ ≈ 5 (the earliest times are not
shown to gain dynamical range in the y axis). For τ ≳ 5,

correlation kðτÞ obtained in the last three orders l of the NLCE
(NLCE-l in the legends), and in the three largest chains with L
sites and periodic boundary conditions diagonalized (ED-L in the

order of the NLCE (DENLCE-l ) and the largest chain diagonalized
(DEED-L ), while results for the grand canonical ensemble are
shown for the last order of the NLCE (GENLCE-l ), which are
converged to machine precision. (a) Quenches Ĥ I → Ĥ 0 , for
l ¼ 17, 18, and 19 (NLCE-17, NLCE-18, and NLCE-19), and
for L ¼ 18, 19, and 20 (ED-18, ED-19, and ED-20), along
with the diagonal ensembles for l ¼ 19 (DENLCE-19 ) and L ¼ 20
(DEED-20 ), and the grand canonical ensemble for l ¼ 19
(GENLCE-19 ). (b) Quenches Ĥ I → Ĥ 1 , in which g1 ¼ 0.12, for
l ¼ 15, 16, 17 (NLCE-15, NLCE-16, NLCE-17), and for L ¼ 17,
18, 19 (ED-17, ED-18, ED-19), along with the diagonal ensembles for l ¼ 17 (DENLCE-17 ) and L ¼ 18 (DEED-18 ), and the grand
canonical ensemble for l ¼ 17 (GENLCE-17 ). Higher orders in the
NLCE, and larger chains in exact diagonalization, are calculated
in (a) than in (b) thanks to particle-number conservation in the
former.

the NLCE and exact diagonalization results split and each
equilibrate to the prediction of the corresponding diagonal
DE
ensemble, kDE
l¼19 (DENLCE−19 ) and kL¼20 (DEED−20 ),
respectively. As in Ref. [23], the NLCE results for the
diagonal ensemble (DENLCE−19 ) are closer to the grand
canonical ensemble ones, kGE
l¼19 (GENLCE-19 ), than the
exact diagonalization results for the diagonal ensemble

(DEED-20 ). The differences between them are due to lack
of convergence of the diagonal ensemble within NLCEs
and finite-size effects for the diagonal ensemble within
exact diagonalization. The NLCE results for the grand
canonical ensemble are converged within machine precision. Consequently, at long times, the NLCE is expected
to be more accurate than exact diagonalization. At
intermediate times 5 ≲ τ ≲ 15, kl¼16 ðτÞ and kl¼17 ðτÞ are
almost indistinguishable from each other, while kL ðτÞ
shifts upward with increasing L, toward the NLCE
predictions. This suggests that NLCE is also more
accurate than exact diagonalization at intermediate times.
In Fig. 11(b), we show dynamics after the quench
ĤI → Ĥ1 (g1 ¼ 0.12) for kl ðτÞ with l ¼ 15, 16, and 17
(the latter two are also reported in Fig. 3) and for kL ðτÞ with
L ¼ 16, 17, and 18. kl ðτÞ and kL ðτÞ are almost indistinguishable from each other up to times τ ≈ 4 (again, the
earliest times are not shown to gain dynamical range in the
y axis). For τ ≳ 4, the NLCE and exact diagonalization
results again split, as for the quench ĤI → Ĥ0 , despite the
fact that both equilibrate to diagonal ensemble results that
DE
are very close to each other. kDE
l¼17 (DENLCE-17 ) and kL¼18
(DEED-18 ) in Fig. 11(b) are almost indistinguishable from
each other and from the grand canonical ensemble result
kGE
l¼17 (GENLCE-17 ). At times 5 ≲ τ ≲ 15, kl¼16 ðτÞ and
kl¼17 ðτÞ are almost indistinguishable, while kL ðτÞ shifts
upward toward the NLCE predictions with increasing L.
As for the quenches ĤI → Ĥ0 , these results suggest that
NLCE is more accurate than exact diagonalization at
intermediate times in quenches ĤI → Ĥ 1 .
The discrepancy between the NLCE and exact diagonalization results at intermediate times after quenches
ĤI → Ĥ1 is likely a manifestation of finite-size effects
in kL ðτÞ that result from the “prethermal” dynamics seen in
Fig. 11(a), which equilibrates to a diagonal ensemble value
(kDE
L¼20 ) that is lower than the expected grand canonical
ensemble one. The results in Fig. 11(b) also make apparent
that, because of finite-size effects, the thermalization rates
for kðτÞ are smaller in exact diagonalization, and increasing
with increasing L, than in NLCE.

diagonalization of chains with L ¼ 18 (see legends) and L ¼ 17

delimit the range ΔE=L ∈ ½0.03; 0.09 in which fΔE ðτÞ is

In Fig. 12, we plot f ΔE ðτÞ, evaluated in chains with L ¼

function of ΔE. We show results at two times, τ ¼ 1 in

at each time. Our main finding in Fig. 12 is that, in the
interval ΔE=L ∈ ½0.03; 0.09, f ΔE ðτÞ is nearly independent
of ΔE, and is approximately the same in chains with L ¼ 17
and L ¼ 18. Similar results were obtained at times τ ∈ ½0; 5,
for which we showed in Appendix C that our best NLCE
