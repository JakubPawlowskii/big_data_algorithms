Abstract
We numerically study the relaxation of correlation functions in weakly perturbed integrable XXZ chain. The decay of the spin-current and the energy-current correlations
at zero magnetization are well described by single, but quite distinct, relaxation rates
governed by the square of the perturbation strength g . However, at finite magnetization
a single correlation function reveals multiple relaxation rates. The result can be understood in terms of multi-scale relaxation scenario, where various relaxation times are
linked with various quantities which are conserved in the reference integrable system.
On the other hand, the correlations of non-commuting quantities, being conserved at
particular anisotropies ∆, decay non-exponentially with characteristic time scale linear
in g .

Introduction

Integrable quantum many-body systems attract a lot of attention due to their unique properties,
as well as due to development of new analytical and numerical tools to deal with them (for
a recent review see Ref. [1]). The crucial role in the behavior of such systems is played by
the presence of extensive number of local and/or quasilocal conserved quantities (CQ), which
have important consequences for the (lack of) relaxation of observables and for the transport
properties. The latter consequences are formally expressed via the Mazur bounds which relate
the long-time correlations (stiffness) of observables with their projections on the local CQ
(charges) [2, 3]. However, the microscopic models are integrable only for fine-tuned sets of
parameters, while more realistic systems might be described in terms of nearly integrable
(NI) models which contain small but non-vanishing perturbation that breaks the integrability
[4, 5]. An important question concerns the details of the integrability breaking, in particular
whether the asymptotic dynamics becomes consistent with the generic dissipative diffusivetype transport [6–8]. So far, the properties of NI models are better understood at intermediate
time-scales, when the dynamics resembles that of integrable models, the phenomenon known
as prethermalization [9–11].
The problem of asymptotic dynamics of NI models at long time scales [12, 13] appears to
be more complex. It has been argued that the time evolution can be accurately described as the
generalized Gibbs enseble [14, 15] with the time-dependent Lagrange parameters [16]. Several analytical and numerical studies have demonstrated that breaking of integrability leads to
exponential relaxation of typical observables and that the corresponding relaxation rates scale
quadratically with the strength of the perturbation [12, 17–20]. Description of NI models
within the framework of generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) [21–25] seems also demanding,
since the generic integrability-breaking processes involve large momenta transfers [26, 27].
Nevertheless, recent results suggest that arbitrarily weak perturbation applied to a macroscopic integrable system restores the generic chaotic (dissipative) dynamics [28]. Still, more
detailed understanding or even theoretical analysis of the relaxation of different quantities in
NI systems is mostly lacking so far.
In this work we numerically study relaxation of several operators in a NI XXZ model, employing the microcanonical Lanczos method (MCLM) [29–31] which allows to reach longenough times even for NI model. In particular, we confirm that both spin-current and energycurrent decay exponentially in time with relaxation rates that scale quadratically with the
strength of perturbation. However, the energy-current relaxation rate turns out to be much
smaller than the relaxation rate for the spin current. The presence of distinct relaxation times
is consistent with the predictions of GHD [26, 27]. This result can be simply explained by
single (but different for both quantities) local/quasilocal CQ (charges) involved in the relaxation process [19]. Still even in this case, a more detailed analysis using the memory-function
indicates a weak contribution of other CQ from the same symmetry sector. Moreover, we can
construct a single observable that clearly reveals multiple relaxation rates or, in other words,
that its relaxation cannot be described by a single exponential function. We confirm the latter
possibility studying relaxation of current correlations in sectors with small magnetization, i.e.,
z
with non-zero total spin Stot
6= 0. Results in this case can be explained with a projection on the
decay of several CQ with different relaxation times. Furthermore, we find that the relaxation
explicitly depends on the form and the symmetry of the perturbation.
Finally, we study the weakly perturbed XXZ model for the specific values anisotropy parameters, ∆, when the many-body spectra are macroscopically degenerate. Such degeneracy
z
in the integrable model allows for additional local CQ which do not commute with Stot
or with
other local CQ [32]. It is the case, e.g., for the anisotropy parameter ∆ = 0.5 which we use in
x
the present work. However, the simplest example can be studied for ∆ = 1, where Stot
is con2

served and but does not commute with Stot
. Upon introducing a perturbation, the correlation
z
functions of quantities which do not commute with Stot
show - instead of exponential decay
- an approximately Gaussian decay with the characteristic relaxation time that scales linearly
with the perturbation strength.

We focus on the result for large (infinite) temperature T = 1/β  J. Here, 〈. . . 〉 = Tr(. . . )
z
denotes averaging either over the canonical ensemble with fixed Stot
(in Secs. 2-4) or grandiH t
−iH t
canonical ensemble (in Sec. 5), and jα (t) = e jα e
. Note that Cσ (t) and Cκ (t) are related
via the Fourier transform to the dynamical spin conductivity, σ(ω) = β〈 jσ jσ 〉C̃σ (ω), and the
thermal conductivity, κ(ω) = β 2 〈 jκ jκ 〉C̃κ (ω), respectively.
For the numerical evaluation of the spectral functions C̃α (ω), on systems up to L = 28
sites, we use the MCLM which allows for very high frequency resolution, δω ® 10−3 J, and
consequently enables evaluation of Cα (t) up to t ® t max ∼ 103 /J. Reaching large t max J  1
is crucial to follow the slow relaxation at weak perturbations, g  1, and to resolve possible
distinct relaxation times. This is achieved within MCLM by using large number of Lanczos
steps M L ∼ 5.104 . In the following, we numerically calculate canonical Cα (t), i.e., in sectors
z
with fixed total spin projections Stot
. Large but finite M L also sets the smallest reliable value
−3
of Cα (t) ¦ 2.10 .
As a first step, we establish the range of the perturbation strength, g, which is relevant for
NI systems. On the one hand, g should be small to remain a perturbation but, on the other
hand, g should be sufficiently large so that the effective mean-free path is smaller then the
system size (L ≤ 28). The latter requirement means that the accessible system sizes impose
lower bounds on the accessible values of g. Since we are not able to directly evaluate the meanfree path, we use the range of parameters for which the decay of the correlation functions
does not reveal any significant L dependence but also exhibits a clear quadratic dependence
on g [12, 19, 20]. Main panels in Fig. 1(a,b) show, respectively, Cσ (t) and Cκ (t) within the
z
sector Stot
= 4 for various g = 0.1 − 0.4, whereas the time in the insets is rescaled by g 2 . For
0.15 ≤ g ≤ 0.3 we observe a perfect collapse of all curves, whereas the latter collapse is worse
for weaker g indicating that the effective mean-free path becomes larger than the systems size.
Therefore from now on, we set g = 0.15.
In Fig. 2(a) we directly compare the relaxation of spin and energy currents Cα (t) at zeroz
magnetization, Stot
= 0. Here, H is invariant under the Z2 spin-flip transformation, generated

Q
by the parity operator, P = J (S +j +S −j ). Since the spin/energy current is odd/even under this
transformation, P jσ P = − jσ and P jκ P = jκ , in this sector both currents are mutually orthogonal, i.e., 〈 jσ jκ 〉 = 0. Consequently, relaxation of both correlations are evidently different. At
longer times, t J > 100, the decays do not show any clear deviations from simple exponential,
Cα (t) ∝ exp(−t/τ0α ), α = σ, κ, where the upper index in the relaxation times, τsα , marks
z
the value of s = Stot
. Nevertheless, it is clear that the relaxation of jσ is much faster than
0
0
that of jκ , τσ ' 3τκ , confirming that the breaking of integrability leads to multiple distinct
relaxation times, here due to different symmetry sectors involved. The evident differences
are also at short times t. Since jσ is not CQ in the reference H0 , there is an incoherent drop
to Cσ0 ∼ 0.5 at t J ∼ O(1), reflecting the nontrivial spin stiffness [3] and finite overlap with
quasilocal CQ [33, 34]. On the other hand, jκ is CQ at g = 0, so one might expect a single
exponential decay in the whole range of t. To good approximation this is indeed the case, but
4

SciPost Phys. 13, 013 (2022)

there is still some visible deviation at t J < 100 about which we comment in more detail in
Sec. 3.
More challenging question is whether distinct relaxation rates can be observed in the dyz
namics of a single observable. This might happen when we consider Stot
6= 0 sectors where
the above symmetry arguments do not apply. In Figs. 2(b-d) we show that a departure from a
z
simple exponential relaxation becomes increasingly visible for Stot
6= 0, when also 〈 jσ jκ 〉 =
6 0.
z
Figs. 2(c,d) for Stot = 4, 6 confirm that for longest t J > 500 the relaxation is asymptotically
z
determined by the same τsκ for both currents, while Stot
= 2 case on Fig. 2(b) is marginal due
to fast decay of Cσ (t) (and the limitation Cσ (t) > 2.10−3 ). Nevertheless, both correlation
functions, and in particular Cσ (t), reveal a clear deviation from a single-exponential decay.
The modest dependence of τsκ on s, as extracted from Fig. 2(a-d), is shown in Fig. 3(a).
More importantly, our analysis indicate that one can fit the decay of correlations Cα (t) for
z
Stot
> 0 by a sum of two exponential functions with distinct relaxation rates τsκ , τsσ . This is
shown in Fig. 3(b,c) for Cσ (t), but also for Cκ (t) in Fig. 3(d). It is indicative that the fit is
consistent with only two relaxation times for both correlations, i.e., with longer relaxation rate
τsκ still weakly dependent on s as given in Fig. 3(a), and much faster τsσ ∼ τ0σ which we can
approximate just with the s = 0 result for Cσ (t) in Fig. 2(a).

The above results may serve as a motivation for a simple phenomenological description.
The value of the correlation functions for t → ∞ in the integrable model, g = 0, is determined
via the Mazur bound [2, 3] by the projections of the studied operators on local/quasilocal CQ
[33–39] Q n , which should be chosen as mutually orthogonal 〈Q nQ n0 〉 ∝ δn,n0 in the canonical
z
ensemble with fixed Stot
. Assuming the completeness (saturation) of the bound, this means

where τn ∝ 1/g 2 . It should be, however, stressed that in contrast to Eq. (4) the appropriate
set of Q n in Eq. (6) is not arbitrary, but determined by the perturbation [5,17,27]. A numerical
algorithm for identifying such modes has been discussed in Ref. [19]. It amounts in finding
eigenvector of the matrix MAB = 〈A(t)B〉 calculated in the long-time regime, t  1, for a set of
local orthogonal operators, A and B. Since the number of local operators supported on M sites
grows exponentially with M , this method is numerically demanding. Additionally, it requires
full diagonalization of the Hamiltonian hence it is applicable only to small systems. Therefore
in this work, we do not attempt to determine relevant Q n in more detail.
z
However, for Stot
= 0 one can assume that one of Q n in Eq. (6) can be well approximated
by jκ (being one of CQ in the reference system), which explains nearly perfect exponential
decay of Cκ (t) in Fig. 2(a), even though a small correction might be needed (as tested in more
detail in Sec. 3). It is well known [3] that in the integrable model (g = 0) the spin-current
z
z
stiffness, Cσ0 , is nonzero for Stot
= 0 provided that ∆ < 1. Since 〈 jσ jκ 〉 = 0 for Stot
= 0, Q n
0
that are relevant for the decay time τσ have to be related to the quasilocal CQ [19,33,34,40].
z
On the other hand, for nonzero Stot
, we clearly need at least two distinct relaxation times
s
s
τκ , τσ to fit both decays, Cα (t). The necessity of multiple relaxation times is most evident for
z
z
Cσ (t) at Stot
= 2, 4 presented on Fig. 3(b-c). Upon changing Stot
, one has also to modify τsκ ,
z
as suggested by the results in Fig. 3(a), while the dependence of τsσ on Stot
is less evident, so
s
0
we can approximate τσ ∼ τσ . In Fig. 3(d) we show that Cκ (t) can also be well fitted by a sum
of two exponential functions, with the very same relaxation times which are used for fitting
Cσ (t) in Fig. 3(c). This indicates that the same pair of Q n is relevant for the decay of the spin
z
and the energy currents for Stot
6= 0.

Memory-function analysis of the energy-current correlations

It is desirable to have more explicit way to evaluate the long-time decay of correlations, Cα (t),
for chosen perturbations H 0 , and in particular a direct expression for relevant relaxation rates
1/τn . Here, it is convenient to follow the Mori formalism [41,42], where one can generally express the current-correlation relaxation function φα (ω) in terms of the corresponding memory

and in particular the dynamical relaxation rate Γα (ω) = Im Mα (ω).
On the other hand, for a NI system one can find an explicit expression in the case where
the current is a CQ in the reference system [17,19]. This is particularly the case for the energy
current, [H0 , Q 3 ] = [H0 , jκ ] = 0. Then, within the lowest order in the perturbation g  1 one
can approximate MF as

i.e., as the correlation function of the the force F in the unperturbed - integrable system. Eq. (8)
is derived under the assumption that only a single charge Q 3 = jκ is relevant for the decay, as
z
well as that F has no overlap with any of Q n . This can be true for the sector with Stot
= 0 and

can be directly tested for operator F for the particular H in Eq. (1),

with Til = (Sl+ Si− +H.c.)/2. Due to the parity symmetry at Stot

z
of F in the reference H0 system. The MCLM result for Γκ (ω)/g 2 at Stot
= 0 is presented in
Fig. 4, both as extracted directly via Eq. (7) from C̃κ (ω) for various finite g = 0.1 − 0.4, as
well as by calculating the result from Eq. (8) for the force given in Eq. (9). The overall agreement of perturbation result with the numerically extracted MF Γκ (ω)/g 2 , (being essentially
g-independent) is very satisfactory in the whole ω regime [see the inset of Fig. 4(a)]. Still,
at low ω/J < 0.4 there appears a visible difference. Partly responsible is the (apparently)
singular contribution in perturbative Γκ0 = Γκ (ω → 0), which seems to indicate a small overlap
with some CQ (possibly being a finite-size effect). Apart from that, also visible is a quantitative
mismatch at ω → 0 which indicates that the relevant Q n in Eq. (6) is not just jκ , and consez
quently also Eq. (8) is not a full description of relaxation. In other words, even for Stot
=0
more than a single mode is needed in Eq. (6) to properly describe Cκ (t).
z
In Fig. 4(b) we present Γκ (ω)/g 2 for fixed g = 0.15 but various Stot
. It is indicative that
z
for ω/J > 0.15 the MF is essentially independent of Stot . On the other hand, the decrease of
z
Γκ0 = 1/τsκ with Stot
reflects the observed increase of τsκ in Fig. 3(a). Still, it is not straightforward to capture this in a perturbative approach, Eq. (8).

Dependence on the form of perturbation

In Sec. 2 we analysed a particular form of perturbation, i.e., the next nearest-neighbor interaction, Eq. (1), which does not break the translational symmetry or the spin parity P. This is
also essential for the phenomenological explanation, Eq. (6), in terms of decaying CQ, as well

current α = σ , κ correlation functions Cα (t) for Stot
= 0. We observe exponential decay with
2
a single relaxation time τα ∝ 1/g , which is different from two distinct relaxation times obtained for the P-preserving H 0 , Eq. (1), i.e., the relaxation evidently depends on the form of
perturbation. One may interpret this behavior in terms of conjecture, Eq. (6). All observables
which have non-vanishing projection on Q n with the longest relaxation time should asymptotically decay with the same decay rate. In order to obtain different rate, one needs to build an
operator that is strictly orthogonal to the latter Q n . It is highly nontrivial task, since approximate Q n in Eq. (6) can be obtained numerically only for small system. For the parity-preserving
perturbations, the total Hamiltonian is even and all Q n in Eq. (6) have well defined parity being either odd or even. Then operators from one parity sectors are strictly orthogonal to Q n
from the other parity sector. Due to this orthogonality we observe different relaxation times
in odd and even sectors without any fine-tuning of the studied observables. However for odd
perturbations, the total Hamiltonian contains even and odd terms, hence both parity sectors
are mixed during the time evolution. As a consequence, Q n in Eq. (6) may not have well
defined parity.

Non-commuting conserved quantities and their non-exponential
relaxation

In this section, we focus on specific values of the anisotropy parameter, ∆, where the manybody spectra exhibit additional massive degeneracies [31]. The latter originate from eigenz
states corresponding to different Stot
with equal energies. This property allows for the presence
of non-commuting local/quasilocal CQ [32,43–45]. As a first example we take ∆ = 1 in which

Figure 5: Current correlation function Cα (t) for the perturbation, Eq. (10), breaking

= 0.

It is clear that O1 is a local operator which commutes with H0 at ∆ = 1, but does not commute
z
with other local CQ, e.g., not with the Stot
.
The second nontrivial case is related with the commensurate ∆ = cos(π/3) = 1/2, for
which the non-commuting local CQ have been derived (for g = 0) in Ref. [32]. Here, we
study the relaxation of

which does not commute with Stot
and is not invariant under translations by odd number of
sites. It should be mentioned that analogous local operators
exist for other commensurate
P
j + +
cases, in particular for ∆ = cos(π/2) = 0, where O2 = j (−1) (S j S j+1 + H.c) is local CQ for
H0 [45].
In similarity to Eq. (3), we calculate normalized correlations functions C1 (t) and C3 (t) for
the operators O1 and O3 , respectively. In contrast to the preceding section, now the averaging
〈. . . 〉 is carried out over grand canonical ensemble. We note that O3 is similar to the previously
studied spin-current jσ in the sense, that it does not commute with H0 , but has large projection
on the corresponding quasilocal CQ [32]. In order to confirm this, in the inset in Fig. 6(c) we
show the finite-size scaling of the relevant stiffness C̃3 (ω → 0+ , g = 0) (with value ' 0.4
thermodynamic limit L → ∞). P
Without imposing the translational symmetry, we studied all
local non-commuting operators i (Ai + A†i ), where Ai are supported on up to 3 sites and do
z
not commute with Stot
. Utilizing the alhorithm from Ref. [40], we have found (for ∆ = 1/2,
g = 0 and L ≤ 14) that O3 has the largest stiffness out of all these operators (not shown).
Next, we focus on the asymptotic decay of Cα (t), α = 1, 3, and their dependence on g 6= 0.
To this end, we first calculate the Fourier transform, Cα (ω), and then its cumulative spectral
function

so that one may directly compare relaxations of both considered observables. The numerical results are shown in figures Figs. 6(a,b) and 6(d,e) for R3 (ω) at ∆ = 1/2 and R1 (ω) at
∆ = 1, respectively. In contrast to the spin- and energy-currents discussed in the preceding
sections, curves for various g do not collapse when one rescales the frequency by g 2 , as it is
shown in the insets in Fig. 6(b,e). However, a convincing collapse may be obtained for the
scaling ω/g. Moreover, the rescaled curves can be quite accurately fitted by the error function, shown as the dashed curves in Fig. 6, implying C̃α (ω) ∝ exp[−a (ω/g)2 ] where the
coefficient a does not depend on g. Consequently, the decay is not exponential but Gaussian,
Cα (t) ∝ exp[−(t/τα )2 ], where the characteristic relaxation rate, 1/τα ∝ g.
The Gaussian relaxation occurs in the vicinity of ∆ characterized by additional degeneraz
cies [31, 45], originating from that eigenstate with different Stot
having the same energy. The
perturbation breaks integrability but also lifts the latter degeneracy. In order to disentangle
these two mechanisms, we also study the correlation functions, C̃α (ω, g) for g = 0 but with
shifted ∆ = 1/2 + δ (for α = 3) and ∆ = 1 + δ (for α = 1). Then, the degeneracy is lifted
without destroying the integrability. The results are shown in Fig. 6(c,f) for both α = 1, 3.
One observes the same behavior as for the NI system above, i.e., Cα (t) ∝ exp[−(t/τα )2 ],
with 1/τα ∝ δ. This result explains additionally the origin of the anomalous scaling of characteristic τα . The nonzero stiffnesses, C̃α (ω → 0+ , g = 0), emerges from states |m〉 and |n〉 in
z
Eq. (13) with different Stot
, but with equal energies Em = En . The latter degeneracy is lifted

either by g 6= 0 or δ 6= 0 already in the first order perturbation theory, |Em = En | ∝ g, δ [45],
leading to the scaling ω/(g, δ), shown in Fig. 6.

Conclusions

We numerically analyzed the decay of normalized correlation function Cα (t) of different local
quantities in the nearly integrable XXZ model. Correlations generally reveal a fast drop at
short times t J ∼ O(1), consistent with finite stiffnesses of studied quantities in the integrable
model H0 . A weak integrability breaking g  1 then leads to further slow - exponentiallike - decay which is characterized with a single or multiple relaxation times, all scaling with
the perturbation strength τn ∝ 1/g 2 . The simplest cases appear to be the energy-current jκ
z
and spin-current jσ correlations at zero magnetization Stot
= 0, where - due to symmetry different CQ are involved in the relaxation of both quantities, and consequently relevant τn
are quite distinct. Since jκ is by itself CQ within H0 , one can go a step further and give an
explicit memory-function analysis and perturbative expression for the relaxation-rate spectral
function Γκ (ω). In this case the extracted and perturbative Γκ (ω) match quite well in the
whole ω range. Still, some deviations in Γκ (ω ∼ 0) = 1/τ0κ as well as in Cκ (t) at shorter t/g 2
indicate on possible multiple relaxation times and more than one relevant Q n even in this case.
z
The existence of multiple relaxation times is becoming evident for Stot
6= 0. The conjecture
Eq. (6) concerning the presence of multiple relaxation times τn , which are linked with (appropriately rotated) various CQ of the parent integrable model, is not in conflict with previous
results [20] which report a simple exponential relaxation. In order to demonstrate at least two
relaxation times, we have carefully selected observables so that they have a large projection
z
z
on quickly decaying CQ for Stot
6= 0 (Q n relevant for jσ at Stot
= 0), as well as much smaller
projection on slowly decaying one (Q 3 = jκ ). Namely, we made us of the result from Ref. [3]
z
that the projection 〈 jσ jκ 〉 is proportional to Stot
thus the projection may be easily tuned via
changing the magnetization sector. Typically, the opposite holds true: one studies observables
which have largest projection on simplest CQ, which are supported only on the few sites and
the related τn are the longest relaxation times [19]. As a consequences, small and fast decaying projections on more complicated CQ in Eq. (6) may not be visible in the numerical
results. Such generic scenario of the multi-scale relaxation is consistent with numerical results
obtained in the present work as well as in Ref. [19]. Nevertheless, it should be considered
as conjecture that requires further studies and should be verified for other nearly integrable
systems.
Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the form, in particular the symmetry, of the perturbation is relevant for the decay of Cα (t). In contrast to quantities considered above at
general anisotropy ∆ and their decay, the correlations Cα (t) of particular quantities Ol , being
z
conserved by H0 only at commensurate ∆0 = cos(π/m), but not commuting with Stot
, behave
qualitatively different. Under finite perturbation, which here can be introduced either by g 6= 0
or by deviation ∆ = ∆0 + δ, we observe effectively a (non-exponential) Gaussian-like decay
of Cα (t) with different scaling of characteristic decay time, i.e. τα ∝ 1/g. The origin here is
the lifting of macroscopic degeneracy of many-body states at these particular ∆0 .
