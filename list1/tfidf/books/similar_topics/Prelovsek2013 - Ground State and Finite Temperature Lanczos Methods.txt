Ground State and Finite Temperature
Lanczos Methods
P. Prelovšek and J. Bonča

Abstract The present review will focus on recent development of exactdiagonalization (ED) methods that use Lanczos algorithm to transform large sparse
matrices onto the tridiagonal form. We begin with a review of basic principles of the
Lanczos method for computing ground-state static as well as dynamical properties.
Next, generalization to finite-temperatures in the form of well established finitetemperature Lanczos method is described. The latter allows for the evaluation of
temperatures T > 0 static and dynamic quantities within various correlated models.
Several extensions and modification of the latter method introduced more recently
are analysed. In particular, the low-temperature Lanczos method and the microcanonical Lanczos method, especially applicable within the high-T regime. In order
to overcome the problems of exponentially growing Hilbert spaces that prevent ED
calculations on larger lattices, different approaches based on Lanczos diagonalization
within the reduced basis have been developed. In this context, recently developed
method based on ED within a limited functional space is reviewed. Finally, we briefly
discuss the real-time evolution of correlated systems far from equilibrium, which can
be simulated using the ED and Lanczos-based methods, as well as approaches based
on the diagonalization in a reduced basis.

1.1 Introduction
Models of strongly correlated systems have been one of the most intensively studied
theoretical subjects in the last two decades, stimulated at first by the discovery of
compounds superconducting at high-temperatures and ever since by the emergence

of various novel materials and phenomena which could be traced back to strongly
correlated electrons in these systems. Recently, cold atoms in optical lattice offer a
different realization of strongly correlated quantum entities, whereby these systems
can be even tuned closer to theoretical models.
One of the most straightforward methods to numerically deal with the lattice (discrete) models of correlated particles, which are inherently many-body (MB) quantum
systems, is exact diagonalization (ED) of small-size systems. In view of the absence
of well-controlled analytical methods, ED method has been employed intensively to
obtain results for static and dynamical properties of various models with different
aims: (a) to search and confirm novel phenomena specific for strongly correlated
systems, (b) to test theoretical ideas and analytical results, (c) to get reference results
for more advanced numerical techniques.
MB quantum lattice models of interacting particles are characterized with a dimension of the Hilbert space given by the number of basis states Nst ∝ K N that is in
turn exponentially increasing with the lattice size N , where K is the number of local
quantum states. It is therefore clear that ED methods can treat fully only systems
with limited Nst , i.e., both K and N must be quite modest.
Among the ED approaches the full ED within the Hilbert space of the model
Hamiltonian, yielding all eigenenergies and eigenfunctions, is the simplest to understand, most transparent and easy to implement. In principle it allows the evaluation of
any ground state (g.s.) property as well as finite temperature T > 0 static or dynamic
quantity, at the expense of very restricted Nst . In spite of that, it represents a very
instructive approach but also remains essentially the only practical method when all
exact levels are needed, e.g., for studies of level statistics.
Lanczos-based ED methods have already long history of applications since
Cornelius Lanczos [1] proposed the diagonalization of sparse matrices using the iterative procedure, allowing for much bigger Hilbert spaces Nst relative to full ED. Lanczos diagonalization technique is at present a part of standard numerical linear algebra
procedures [2, 3] and as such in solid state physics mainly used to obtain the g.s. energies and wavefunction with corresponding expectation values. The approach has been
quite early on extended to calculation of the dynamical response functions within the
g.s. [4]. The method has been in the last 20 years extensively used in connection with
models related to high-Tc materials, for which we can refer to an earlier overview [5].
The present review will focus on recent development of ED-based and Lanczosbased methods. The basics of the Lanczos method are presented in Sect. 1.2 and its
application for g.s. properties in Sect. 1.3. One of already established generalizations
is the finite-temperature Lanczos method (FTLM) [6, 7], reviewed in Sect. 1.4, which
allows for the evaluation of T > 0 static and dynamic properties within simplest
models. Several extensions and modifications of the latter have been introduced
more recently, in particular the low-temperature Lanczos method (LTLM) [8] and
the microcanonical Lanczos method (MCLM) [9], particularly applicable within the
high-T regime.
Since the application of the ED methods there have been attempts and proposals for the proper choice of reduced basis which could allow for the study
of bigger systems. While this is clearly very broad subject with most substantial

achievements in one-dimensional (1D) systems within the framework of the densitymatrix renormalization-group (DMRG) idea, there are also successful applications
in higher D > 1 combined with the Lanczos procedure being reviewed in Sect. 1.5.
Recently, there is also quite an intensive activity on studies of real-time evolution of
correlated systems, both under the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium conditions
that can be simulated using the ED and Lanczos-based methods, as discussed in
Sect. 1.6.

1.2 Exact Diagonalization and Lanczos Method
1.2.1 Models, Geometries and System Sizes
ED-based methods are mostly restricted to simple models with only few local quantum states K per lattice site in order to reach reasonable system sizes N . Consequently, there are only few classes of MB models that so far exhaust the majority
of ED and Lanczos-method studies, clearly also motivated and influenced by the
challenging physics and relevance to novel materials and related experiments.
To get some feeling for available sizes reachable within the ED-based approaches,
it should be reminded that in full ED routines the CPU time scales with the number
of operations O p ∝ Nst3 , while the memory requirement is related to the storage
of the whole Hamiltonian matrix and all eigenvectors, i.e., Mem ∝ Nst2 . This limits at present stage of computer facilities the full ED method to Nst < 2 · 104 MB
states. On the other hand, using the Lanczos-based iterative methods for the diagonalization of sparse matrices (Hamiltonians), CPU and memory requirements scale
as O p, Mem ∝ Nst , at least in their basic application, to calculate the g.s. and
its wavefunction. In present-day applications this allows the consideration of much
larger basis sets, i.e., Nst < 109 . Still, lattice sizes N reached using the Lanczos technique remain rather modest, compared to some other numerical approaches as the
DMRG and quantum-Monte-Carlo (QMC) methods, if the full Hilbert basis space
relevant for the model is used.
The simplest nontrivial class of MB lattice models are spin models, the prototype
being the anisotropic Heisenberg model for coupled S = 1/2 spins,
H=

i jα

where the sum i j runs over pairs of lattice sites with an arbitrary interaction Jiαα
j
(being in principle anisotropic) and Siα are component of local S = 1/2 operator.
The model has K = 2 quantum states per lattice site and therefore allows for biggest
N in the ED-based approaches where Nst ∝ 2 N basis states. To reduce Nst as
many symmetries and good quantum numbers as practically possible are used to
decompose the Hamiltonian into separate blocks. Evident choice are sectors with

z
the (z-component of) total spin Stot
and the wavevector q for systems with periodic
boundary conditions, but further also rotational symmetries of particular lattices have
been used. In this way system sizes up to N ∼ 36 (for largest and most interesting
z
= 0) have been reached so far using the Lanczos technique without any
sector Stot
basis reduction.
On the basis of this simple model one can already discuss the feasibility of the
Lanczos-based methods with respect to other numerical quantum MB methods. For
the g.s. in 1D spin systems more powerful methods allowing for much bigger systems
are DMRG and related approaches. For unfrustrated models in D > 1 the QMC
methods are superior for the evaluation of static quantities at any T . Still, Lanczosbased methods become competitive or at least not superseded for frustrated spin
models (where QMC can run into minus-sign problem) or for dynamical properties
at T > 0.
Next in complexity and very intensively studied prototype model is the t-J model,
representing strongly correlated itinerant electrons with an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
interaction between their spins,

H =−

where due to the strong on-site repulsion doubly occupied sites are forbidden and
one is dealing with projected fermion operators c̃is = cis (1 − n i,−s ). The model
can be considered as a good microscopic model for superconducting cuprates which
are doped Mott insulators and has been therefore one of the most studied using the
Lanczos method [5]. For a theoretical and experimental overview of Mott insulators
and metal-insulator transitions see Ref. [10].
z
and q, also the
It has K = 3 quantum states per lattice site and besides Stot
number of electrons Ne (or more appropriate the number of holes Nh = N − Ne ) are
the simplest quantum numbers to implement. Since the model reveals an interesting
physics in D > 1, the effort was in connection with high-Tc cuprates mostly on 2D
square lattice. Here the alternative numerical methods have more drawbacks (e.g.,
minus sign problem in QMC methods due to the itinerant character of fermions) so
Lanczos-based methods are still competitive, in particular for getting information on
T > 0 dynamics and transport. The largest systems considered with Lanczos method
so far are 2D square lattice with N = 32 sites and Nh = 4 holes [11].
Clearly, one of the most investigated within the MB community is the standard
single-band Hubbard model, which has K = 4 states per lattice site. Due to the
complexity Nst ∝ 4 N the application of ED and Lanczos-based method is already
quite restricted reaching so far N = 20 sites [12] requiring already Nst ∼ 109 basis
states. The model is also the subject of numerous studies using more powerful QMC
method and various cluster dynamical-mean-field-theory (DMFT) methods for much
larger lattices so Lanczos-based approaches have here more specific goals.
Since reachable lattices for above mentioned models are rather small it is important to choose properly their geometries. This is not the problem in 1D models,
but becomes already essential for 2D lattices, analysed in connection with novel

materials, in particular high-Tc cuprates and related materials. In order to keep the
periodic boundary conditions for 2D square lattice the choice of Pythagorean lattices with N = λ2x + λ2y with λx , λ y [13] has significantly extended available sizes.
Some of frequently used are presented in Fig. 1.1. Taking into account only even
N such lattices include N = 8, 10, 16, 18, 20, 26, 32, 36 sites. While unit cells of
such lattices are squares, it has been observed that they are not always optimal with
respect to the number of next-nearest-neighbors and further nearest neighbors. It has
been claimed and partly tested that better result are obtained with slightly deformed
lattices (still with periodic boundary conditions) which at the same time offer an even
bigger choice of sizes [14, 15].

1.2.2 Lanczos Diagonalization Technique
The Lanczos technique is a general procedure to transform and reduce a symmetric
Nst × Nst matrix A to a symmetric M × M tridigonal matrix TM . From the chosen
initial Nst -dimensional vector v1 one generates an orthogonal basis of {v1 , · · · , vM }
vectors which span the Krylow space {v1 , Av1 , · · · , AM−1 v1 } [1–3, 16].
In usual applications for the quantum MB system defined with the Hamiltonian
operator H the Lanczos algorithm starts with a normalized vector |φ0 , chosen as
a random vector in the relevant Hilbert space with Nst basis states. The procedure
generates orthogonal Lanczos vectors L M = {|φm , m = 0 · · · M} spanning the
Krylow space {|φ0 , H |φ0 , · · · , H M |φ0 }. Steps are as follows: H is applied to
|φ0  and the resulting vector is split in components parallel to |φ0 , and normalized
|φ1  orthogonal to it, respectively,
H |φ0  = a0 |φ0  + b1 |φ1 .

(1.3)

Since H is Hermitian, a0 = φ0 |H |φ0  is real, while the phase of |φ1  can be chosen
so that b1 is also real. In the next step H is applied to |φ1 ,
H |φ1  = b1 |φ0  + a1 |φ1  + b2 |φ2 ,

(1.4)

6

P. Prelovšek and J. Bonča

where |φ2  is orthogonal to |φ0  and |φ1 . It follows also b1 = φ0 |H |φ1  = b1 .
Proceeding with the iteration one gets in i steps
H |φi  = bi |φi−1  + ai |φi  + bi+1 |φi+1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ M,

(1.5)

where in Eq. (1.5) by construction there are no terms involving |φi−2  etc. By stopping
the iteration at i = M and setting b M+1 = 0, the Hamiltonian can be represented
in the basis of orthogonal Lanczos functions |φi  as the tridiagonal matrix HM with
diagonal elements ai , i = 0 . . . M, and off-diagonal ones bi , i = 1 . . . M. Such a
matrix is easily diagonalized using standard numerical routines to obtain approximate
eigenvalues  j and corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors |ψ j ,
|ψ j  =

M


v ji |φi ,

j = 0 . . . M.

(1.6)

i=0

It is important to realize that |ψ j  are (in general) not exact eigenfunctions of H , but
show a remainder. On the other hand, it is evident from the diagonalization of HM
that matrix elements
ψi |H |ψ j  =  j δi j , i, j = 0 . . . M,

(1.7)

are diagonal independently of L M (but provided i, j ≤ M), although the values  j
can be only approximate.
If in the Eq. (1.5) b M+1 = 0, we have found a (M + 1)-dimensional eigenspace
where HM is already an exact representation of H . This inevitably happens when
M = Nst − 1, but for M < Nst − 1 it can only occur if the starting vector is
orthogonal to some invariant subspace of H which we avoid by choosing the input
vector |φ0  as a random one.
It should be recognized that the Lanczos approach is effective only for sparse
Hamiltonians, characterized by the connectivity of each basis state with K n  Nst
basis states. All prototype discrete tight-binding models discussed in Sect. 1.2.1 are
indeed of such a type in the local MB basis. Estimating the computation requirements,
the number of operations O p needed to perform M Lanczos iterations scales as
O p ∝ K n M Nst . The main restriction is still in memory requirements due to large
Nst . A straightforward application of Eq. (1.5) would require the fast storage of all
|φi , i = 0 . . . M, i.e., also the memory capacity Mem ∝ M Nst . However, for the
evaluation of the eigenvalues alone during the iteration, Eq. (1.5), only three |φi  are
successively required, so this leads to Mem ∝ 3Nst . If the Hamiltonian matrix is
not evaluated on the fly (simultaneously), then also Mem ∝ K n Nst for the nonzero
Hamilton matrix elements is needed.
The Lanczos diagonalization is in essence an iterative power method which is
known to converge fast for the extreme lower and upper eigenvalues [2, 3], clearly
in physical application most relevant is the search for the g.s. energy E 0 and corresponding wavefunction |Ψ0 . Typically, M > 50 are enough to reach very high

1 Ground State and Finite Temperature Lanczos Methods

7

accuracy for both. It is evident that for such modest M  Nst one cannot expect
any reliable results for eigenstates beyond the few at the bottom and the top of the
spectrum. On the other hand, the Lanczos procedure is subject to roundoff errors,
introduced by the finite-precision arithmetics which usually only becomes severe at
larger M > 100 after the convergence of extreme eigenvalues and is seen as the loss
of the orthogonality of vectors |φi . It can be remedied by successive reorthogonalization [2, 3, 16] of new states |φi , plagued with errors, with respect to previous
ones. However this procedure requires O p ∼ M 2 Nst operations, and can become
computationally more demanding than Lanczos iterations themselves. This effect
also prevents one to use the Lanczos method, e.g., to efficiently tridiagonalize full
large matrices [3].

1.3 Ground State Properties and Dynamics
After |Ψ0  is obtained, the g.s. static properties can be evaluated in principle for any
operator A as
(1.8)
Ā0 = Ψ0 |A|Ψ0 .
Clearly, the procedure (1.8) for large basis is effective only if operator A is in the
same basis also sparse, as it is in most cases of interest.
It is, however, the advantage of the Lanczos procedure that also g.s. dynamical
functions can be calculated within the same framework [4]. Let us consider the
dynamical (autocorrelation) response function
C(ω) = Ψ0 |A†

1
A|Ψ0 ,
ω+ + E 0 − H

(1.9)

for the observable given by the operator A where ω+ = ω + i,  > 0. To calculate
C(ω) one has to run the second Lanczos procedure with a new initial function |φ̃0 ,
|φ̃0  =

(1.10)

Starting with |φ̃0  one generates another Lanczos subspace L̃ M̃ = {|φ̃ j , j = 0, M̃}
with (approximate) eigenvectors |ψ̃ j  and eigenenergies ˜ j . The matrix for H in the
new basis is again a tridiagonal one with ã j and b̃ j elements, respectively. Terminating the Lanczos procedure at given M̃, one can evaluate Eq. (1.9) as a resolvent of
the HM̃ matrix expressed in the continued-fraction form [4, 5, 17],

(1.12)

are exact for given |Ψ0  provided l ≤ M̃, since the operator H l , l < M̃, is exactly
reproduced within the Lanczos (or corresponding Krylow) space L̃ M̃ .
Finally, C(ω) (1.11) can be presented as a sum of j = 0, M̃ poles at ω = ˜ j − E 0
with corresponding weights w j . As a practical matter we note that in analogy to
Eq. (1.6)
(1.13)
w j = |ψ̃ j |A|Ψ0 |2 = α 2 |ψ̃ j |φ̃0 |2 = α 2 ṽ 2j0 ,
hence no matrix elements need to be evaluated within this approach. In contrast to the
autocorrelation function (1.11), the procedure allows also the treatment of general
correlation functions C AB (ω), with B = A† . In this case matrix elements Ψ0 |B|ψ̃ j 
have to be evaluated explicitly. It should be also mentioned that at least lowest poles
of C(ω), Eq. (1.11), should coincide with eigenenergies ω = E i − E 0 if |φ̃0  is
not orthogonal to |Ψ0 . However, using M̃ > 50 spurious poles can emerge (if no
reorthogonalization is used) which, however, carry no weight as also evident from
exact moments (1.12).
In this chapter we do not intend to present an overview of applications of the full
ED and Lanczos-type studies of g.s. static and dynamical properties of correlated
systems. Such investigations have been numerous even before the high-Tc era but
intensified strongly with studies of prototype models relevant for high-T cuprates
[5] and other novel materials with correlated electrons. Although variety of models
have been investigated they are still quite restricted in the number of local degrees
and sizes.

1.4 Static Properties and Dynamics at T > 0
Before describing the Finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM) we should note
that the Lanczos basis is very useful and natural basis to evaluate the matrix elements
of the type

Wkl = n|H k B H l A|n,

(1.14)

where |n is an arbitrary normalized vector, and A, B are general operators. One
can calculate this expression exactly by performing two Lanczos procedures with
M = max(k, l) steps. The first one, starting with the vector |φ0  = |n, produces
the Lanczos basis L M along with approximate eigenstates |ψ j  and  j . The second
Lanczos procedure is started with the normalized vector |φ̃0  ∝ A|φ0  = A|n,
Eq. (1.10), and generates L̃ M with corresponding |ψ̃ j  and ˜ j . We can now define
projectors onto limited subspaces

Provided that (l, k) < M projectors PM and P̃M span the whole relevant basis for
the operators H k and H l , respectively, so that one can rewrite Wkl in Eq. (1.14) as
Wkl = φ0 |PM H PM H . . . H PM B P̃M H . . . P̃M H P̃M A|φ0 .

(1.16)

Since H is diagonal in the basis |ψ j  and |ψ̃ j , respectively, one can write finally
Wkl =

(1.17)

It is important to note that matrix element expression (1.17) is exact, independent of
how (in)accurate representation |ψi , i and |ψ̃ j ,  j , respectively, are to true system
eigenvalues. The only condition remains that number of Lanczos steps is sufficient,
i.e., M > (l, k).

1.4.1 Finite Temperature Lanczos Method: Static Quantities
A straightforward calculation of canonical thermodynamic average of an operator
A at T > 0 (in a finite system) requires the knowledge of all eigenstates |Ψn  and
corresponding energies E n , obtained, e.g., by the full ED of H ,

The FTLM for T > 0 is based on the evaluation of the expectation value in Eq. (1.19)
for each starting |n using the Lanczos basis. We note that such a procedure guarantees
correct high-T expansion series (for given finite system) to high order. Let us perform
the high-T expansion of Eq. (1.19),

Terms in the expansion n|H k A|n can be calculated exactly using the Lanczos
procedure with M ≥ k steps (with |φ0n  = |n as the starting function) since this is
a special case of the expression (1.14). Using relation (1.17) with l = 0 and B = 1,
we get

(1.20), extending them to k > M. The final result can be expressed as

and the error of the approximation is O(β M+1 ).
Evidently, within a finite system Eq. (1.22), expanded as a series in β, reproduces
exactly the high-T series to the order M. In addition, in contrast to the usual high-T
expansion, Eq. (1.22) remains accurate also for T → 0. Let us assume for simplicity
that the g.s. |Ψ0  is nondegenerate. For initial states |n not orthogonal to |Ψ0 , already
at modest M ∼ 50 the lowest eigenstate |ψ0n  converges to |Ψ0 . We thus have for
β → ∞,

where we have taken into account the completeness of the set |n. Obtained result is
just the usual g.s. expectation value of an operator.
The computation of static quantities (1.22) still involves the summation over the
complete set of Nst states |n, which is clearly not feasible in practice. To obtain a
useful method, a further essential approximation replaces the full summation over
|n by a partial one over a much smaller set of random states [18, 19]. Such an
approximation is analogous to Monte Carlo methods and leads to a statistical error
which can be well estimated and is generally quite small. Let us first consider only
the expectation value (1.19) with respect to a single random state |r , which is a
linear combination of basis states

Note that for T → ∞ we have Z̄ → Nst and therefore at large Nst very accurate
average (1.28) can be obtained even from a single random state [18, 19]. On the
other hand, at finite T < ∞ the statistical error of Ãr increases with decreasing Z̄ .
To reduce statistical error, in particular at modest T > 0, within the FTLM we
sum in addition over R different randomly chosen |r , so that in the final application
Eq. (1.22) leads to

Random states |r  = |φ0r  serve as initial functions for the Lanczos iteration, resulting
in M eigenvalues  rj with corresponding |ψ rj . The relative statistical error is reduced
by sampling (both for A and Z ) and behaves as

δA/A = O(1/ R Z̄ ).

(1.30)

For general operator A the calculation of |ψ rj  and corresponding matrix elements
ψ rj |A|r  is needed. On the other hand, the calculation effort is significantly reduced
if A is conserved quantity, i.e., [H, A] = 0, and can be diagonalized simultaneously
with H . Then

In this case the evaluation of eigenfunctions is not necessary since the element
r |ψ rj  = vrj0 , Eq. (1.6), is obtained directly from eigenvectors of the tridiagonal
r . There are several quantities of interest which can be evaluated in this
matrix HM
way, in particular the thermodynamic properties as internal energy, specific heat,
entropy, as well as uniform susceptibility etc. [7, 20].
Taking into account all mentioned assumptions, the approximation A (1.29)
yields a good estimate of the thermodynamic
average at all T . For low T the error

while
for high T the error is expected

always easy to verify, it is essential to test the method for particular cases.

1.4.2 Finite Temperature Lanczos Method: Dynamical Response
The essential advantage of the FTLM with respect to other methods is nevertheless in
the calculation of dynamical quantities. Let us consider the dynamical susceptibility

Expansion coefficients in Eq. (1.34) can be again obtained via the Lanczos method,

Wkl following the Eq. (1.17). We again note that (within the full basis |n) the series
are via Wkl exactly evaluated within the Lanczos basis up to order l, k ≤ M. The
latter yields through Eq. (1.34) a combination of (β, t) expansion, i.e. a combination
of high-T , short-t (in frequency high-ω) expansion to very high order. Extending
and resuming series in k and l into exponentials, we get in analogy with Eq. (1.20)

14

P. Prelovšek and J. Bonča

R > 1 is required to get correct also amplitudes of separate peaks in the spectrum of
Eq. (1.37) which are a subject of a statistical error due to the incomplete projection
on different random |r  in ψ̃ rj |A|r r |Ψ0 . Similar statistical error can in fact appear
also for static quantities in Eq. (1.29).

1.4.3 Finite Temperature Lanczos Method: Implementation
Most straightforward is the implementation of the FTLM for static quantities,
Eq. (1.29). In particular for conserved quantities, Eq. (1.31), the computation load
is essentially that of the g.s. Lanczos iteration repeated R times and only a minor
changes are needed within the usual g.s. Lanczos code.
On the other hand, for the dynamical correlation function (1.36) the memory
requirement as well as the CPU time is dominated mostly by the evaluation of the
matrix element ψir |A† |ψ̃ rj  where the operations scale as O p ∝ R M 2 Nst and
memory as Mem ∝ M Nst . This effectively limits the application of the FTLM to
50 < M < 500 where the lower bound is determined by the convergence of the g.s.
|Ψ0 . Still, it should be noted that the calculation can be done simultaneously (without
any additional cost) for all desired T , since matrix elements are evaluated only once.
Evidently, one should use as much as possible symmetries of the Hamiltonian, e.g.,
z
, q to reduce effective Nst by splitting the sampling over different symmetry
Ne , Stot
sectors.
The effect of finite M is less evident. Since M ∼ 100 is enough to converge well
few lowest levels, it is also generally satisfactory for reliable dynamical correlation
functions at low T . At high T , however, one can observe very regular oscillations
which are the artifact of the Lanczos iterations with M  Nst . Namely, the procedure
generates between extreme eigenvalues quite equidistant spectrum of quasi-states
with the level spacing Δ ∼ ΔE/M, where ΔE is the full energy span of MB
eigenstates. The effect is well visible in Fig. 1.2 where the high-T result for the spin
structure factor S(q = π, ω) for the 1D Heisenberg model, Eq. (1.1), is presented
for various M. It is evident that for the presented case (N = 24 and ΔE ∼ 16J )
M > 200 is sufficient to obtain smooth spectra even for high T  J . However,
larger M are advisable if sharper structures persist at high T .
The role of random sampling R is less important for intermediate and high T
since the relative error is largely determined via Z̄ as evident from Eq. (1.28). Larger
R  1 is necessary only for the correct limit T → 0 (for given system size) and for
off-diagonal operators A.
One can claim that the FTLM in general obtains for all reachable systems results
which are at any T very close to exact (full ED) results for the same finite (given N )
system and the accuracy can be improved by increasing M and R. Still, it remains
nontrivial but crucial to understand and have in control finite size effects.
At T = 0 both static and dynamical quantities are calculated from the g.s. |Ψ0 ,
which can be quite dependent on the size and on the shape of the system. At least
in 1D for static quantities the finite-size scaling N → ∞ can be performed in a

controlled way, although in this case more powerful methods as, e.g., the DMRG
are mostly available. In higher dimensional lattices, e.g., in 2D systems finite-size
scaling is practically impossible due to very restricted choice of small sizes and
different shapes. Also g.s. (T = 0) dynamical quantities are often dominated by
few (typically N p < M) peaks which are finite-size dependent [5]. On the other
hand, T > 0 generally introduces the thermodynamic averaging over a large number
of eigenstates. This directly reduces finite-size effects for static quantities, whereas
for dynamical quantities spectra become denser. From Eq. (1.36) it follows that we
get in spectra at elevated T > 0 typically N p ∝ R M 2 different peaks resulting in
nearly continuous spectra. This is also evident from the example of a high-T result
in Fig. 1.2.
It is plausible that finite-size effects at T > 0 become weaker. However, it should
be recognized that there could exist several characteristic length scales in the considered physical (and model) system, e.g. the antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation
length ξ , the transport mean free path ls etc. These lengths generally decrease with
increasing T and results for related quantities get a macroscopic relevance provided
that ξ(T ), ls (T ) < L where L ∝ N 1/D is the linear size of the system. However,
there exist also anomalous cases, e.g., in an integrable system ls can remain infinite
even at T → ∞ [21, 22].
A simple criterion for finite size effects one can use the normalized thermodynamic
sum Z̄ (T ), Eq. (1.28), which provides the effective number of MB states contributing
at chosen T (note that for a system with a nondegenerate g.s. Z̄ (T = 0) = 1). Finitesize temperature T f s can be thus defined with the relation Z̄ (T f s ) = Z ∗ where in
practice the range 10 < Z ∗ < 50 is reasonable. Clearly, the FTLM is best suited just
for systems with a large density of low lying MB states, i.e., for large Z̄ at low T .
Since Z̄ (T ) is directly related to the entropy density s and the specific heat Cv of
the system, large Z̄ at low T is the signature of frustrated quantum MB systems which
are generally difficult to cope with other methods (e.g., the QMC method). Such are
typically examples of strongly correlated electrons with an inherent frustration, e.g.,
the doped AFM and the t-J model, Eq. (1.2), in the strong correlation regime J < t.
We present in Fig. 1.3 as an example the variation of T f s in the 2D t-J model with

the hole doping ch = Nh /N , as calculated for different Z ∗ = 30 − 300 for the fixed
system of N = 18 sites and J/t = 0.3 as relevant for high-T cuprates. It is indicative
that T f s reaches the minimum for intermediate (optimum) doping ch = ch∗ ∼ 0.15,
where we are able to reach T f s /t ∼ 0.1. Away from the optimum doping T f s is
larger, i.e., low-energy spectra are quite sparse both for undoped AFM and even
more for effectively noninteracting electrons far away from half-filling (for nearly
empty or full band).

1.4.4 Low Temperature Lanczos Method
The standard FTLM suffers at T → 0 from a statistical error due to finite sampling
R, both for the static quantities, Eqs. (1.29) and (1.30), as well as for the dynamical
correlations, Eqs. (1.36), and (1.37). The discrepancy can be easily monitored by
the direct comparison with the g.s. Lanczos method, Eqs. (1.8, 1.11). To avoid this
problem, a variation of the FTLM method, named Low-temperature Lanczos method
(LTLM) has been proposed [8] which obtains correct g.s. result (for finite systems)
independent of the sampling R.
The idea of LTLM is to rewrite Eq. (1.19) in a symmetric form

The advantage of the latter form is that it satisfies the correct T = 0 limit provided
that the g.s. is well converged, i.e., |ψ0r  ∼ |Ψ0 . It then follows from Eq. (1.39),
A =

(1.41)

It is again evident that for T → 0 the sampling does not influence results being correct
even for R = 1 if the g.s. |Ψ0  is well converged for all starting |r . The payoff is
in an additional summation over the new Lanczos basis sets |ψ̃ rl
j  which need to be
started from each A|ψlr  in Eq. (1.41) separately. Since the LTLM is designed for
lower T there one can effectively restrict summations in (i, l) in Eq. (1.41) to much
smaller M   M where only lowest states with ir , lr ∼ E 0 contribute [8], and in
addition use smaller M1  M for the basis |ψ̃ rl
j .
An alternative version for Lanczos-type approach [23] for dynamical quantities
is not to start the second Lanczos run from A|r  [7] or from A|ψlr  [8], but from

In this way the sufficiency of only one random vector in the T = 0 limit is reproduced,
while at T > 0 the algorithm has the same time efficiency as the FTLM, but with
much smaller random sampling needed to reach the same accuracy (at least for
low T ). However, the price paid is that results for each T need to be calculated
separately, while within the FTLM all T (or T up to certain value within the LTLM)
are evaluated simultaneously.

1.4.5 Microcanonical Lanczos Method
While most investigations in strongly correlated systems focus on the low-T regime,
there are systems where dynamical properties are nontrivial even at high T . Well
known such case is the spin diffusion constant Ds (T ) in the isotropic Heisenberg
model, Eq. (1.1), which is not known by value and moreover not even its existence
at any T > 0. Similar although somewhat less controversial is the case of transport
quantities, both for integrable or generic nonintegrable models. Whereas the FTLM
seems well adapted for studies of transport response functions, oscillations due to
limited M can affect the crucial low-ω resolution as seen also in Fig. 1.2.
At elevated T it is therefore an advantage to use the Microcanonical Lanczos
method (MCLM) [9], employing the fact from statistical physics that in the thermodynamic limit (for large system) the microcanonical ensemble should yield the
same results as the canonical one. The shortcoming of the MCLM emerges since
in finite systems statistical fluctuations are much larger within the microcanonical
ensemble. Still, reachable finite-size systems have very high density of states in the
core of the MB spectrum as probed by high T . Hence, statistical fluctuations are
at high T effectively smoothed out in contrast to low-T properties dominated by a
small number of low lying MB states.
The implementation of the MCLM is quite simple and straightforward. One first
determines the target energy λ = H (T ) which represents the microcanonical
energy equivalent to the canonical average energy for chosen T and the system size N .
Since λ is a parameter within the MCLM, one can relate it to T by performing either
FTLM (simplified due to conserved quantity H ) on the same system or extrapolating
full ED results (with linear dependence on N ) on small lattices. Next we find a
representative microcanonical state |Ψλ  for the energy λ. One convenient way within
the Lanczos-type approach is to use the new operator
V = (H − λ)2 .

(1.44)

Performing Lanczos iterations with the operator V yields again the extremum eigenvalues, in particular the lowest one close to V ∼ 0. In contrast to the g.s. procedure,
the convergence to a true eigenstate cannot be reached in system sizes of interest
even with M1  100. The reason is extremely small eigenvalue spacing of operator
V scaling as ΔVn ∝ (ΔE/Nst )2 , ΔE being the whole energy span within the given
system. Fortunately such a convergence is not necessary (even not desired) since the
essential parameter is small energy uncertainty σ E , given by
σ E2 = Ψλ |V |Ψλ .

(1.45)

For small energy spread σ E /ΔE < 10−3 typically M1 ∼ 1000 is needed. Again,
to avoid storing M1 Lanczos wavefunctions |φi  Lanczos procedure is performed
twice as described in Sect. 1.2.2, i.e., the second time with known tridiagonal matrix
elements to calculate finally |Ψλ  in analogy with Eq. (1.6). The latter is then used to

1 Ground State and Finite Temperature Lanczos Methods

evaluate any static expectation average A or the dynamical correlation function as
in Eq. (1.9),
1
(1.46)
C(ω, λ) = Ψλ |A† +
A|Ψλ .
ω +λ− H
The latter is evaluated again using Lanczos iterations with M2 steps starting with the
initial wavefunction |φ̃0  ∝ A|Ψλ  and C(ω, λ) is represented in terms of continued
fractions. Since the MB levels are very dense and correlation functions smooth at
T  0 large M2  100 are needed but as well easily reachable to achieve high-ω
resolution in C(ω, λ).
It is evident that the computer requirement for the MCLM both regarding the CPU
and memory are essentially the same as for the g.s. dynamical calculations except
that typically M1 , M2  100. In particular requirements are less demanding than
using the FTLM with M > 100. A general experience is that for systems with large
Nst  10000 the MCLM dynamical results agree very well with FTLM results
for the same system. It should be also noted that actual frequency resolution δω in
C(ω, λ), Eq. (1.46), is limited by δω ∼ σ E which is, however, straightforward to
improve by increasing M1 , M2 with typical values M1 , M2 > 1000. One can also
improve MCLM results for any T by performing an additional sampling over initial
random starting |φ0  as well as over λ with a probability distribution p(λ) simulating
the canonical ensemble in a finite-size system, i.e., by replacing Eq. (1.46) with
C(ω) =



p(λ)C(ω, λ).

1.4.6 Statical and Dynamical Quantities at T > 0: Applications
The FTLM has been designed to deal with simplest tight-binding models of strongly
correlated electrons, at the time mostly with challenging microscopic electronic models of high-Tc superconductors [6, 7], where besides superconductivity there is a
variety of anomalous non-Fermi-like properties even in the normal state. Clearly
of interest in this connection are prototype MB models as the Heisenberg model,
Eq. (1.1), the t-J model, Eq. (1.2) and the Hubbard model on the 2D square lattice.
Unfrustrated Heisenberg model can be numerically studied on much bigger lattices
with QMC and related methods. The 2D Hubbard model was and still is mostly
subject of DMFT and QMC studies, since at half-filling or close to it the Lanczos
methods are quite restricted due to large Nst even for modest sizes N ∼ 16. Therefore
one focus of Lanczos-based approaches was on the t-J model being with some generalizations a microscopic representation of electronic properties of high-Tc cuprates.
Thermodynamic quantities as chemical potential μ, entropy density s, specific
heat Cv are the easiest to implement within the FTLM. Their T - and (hole) doping ch -dependence within the t-J model on a 2D square lattice (calculated up to
N = 26 sites) reveal already very anomalous behavior of doped Mott insulators

20

[24] (as evident already from Fig. 1.3), confirmed also by results for more complete
Hubbard model [25]. An introduction of next-neighbor hopping t  generates also an
asymmetry in thermodynamic properties between hole-doped and electron-doped
cuprates [26] as well quite dramatic influence of stripe order [27] consistent with the
physics of cuprates.
The advantages of the FTLM and also its feasibility for the 2D t-J model are even
more evident in quite numerous studies of spin and charge dynamics at T > 0 [7]
which show good agreement with neutron scattering and NMR [20, 28–30], optical
conductivity σ (ω) and resistivity ρ(T ) [31, 32], Hall constant R H (T ) [33] and a
general non-Fermi-liquid behavior of cuprates [30], as well as the puzzling strong
influence of nonmagnetic impurities [34]. As an example of a transport quantity
hardly accessible by other methods we present in Fig. 1.4 the universal planar resistivity ρ(T ), as extracted from the dynamical conductivity σ (ω → 0) = 1/ρ, within
the t-J model for different doping levels ch [32]. Result in Fig. 1.4 clearly shows
a linear dependence below the pseudogap temperature T ∗ dependent on doping ch .
Another characteristic signature is a saturation (plateau) of ρ(T ) at low doping and
the universal trend at high T .
Spectral properties as manifested in single-particle spectral functions A(k, ω)
are in the core of the understanding of cuprates, as well as of strongly correlated
electrons in general. Here, even g.s. and low-T properties are the challenge for
numerical studies whereby the FTLM can be viewed as a controlled way to get reliable (macroscopic-like) T → 0 result, in contrast to quite finite-size plagued results
obtained via g.s. Lanczos procedure [5]. Using the FTLM at T ∼ T f s with the twisted
boundary condition can simulate a continuous wavevector k. Using in addition the
course graining averaging one can reach results for A(k, ω) [35–37] giving insight
into the electron vs. hole doped angle-resolved photoemission experiments, quasiparticle relaxation and waterfall-like effects. A characteristic
result of such studies is
in Fig. 1.5 for the single-particle density of states N (ω) = k A(k, ω) [35]. Here,
the strength of the FTLM is visible in the high ω resolution within the most interesting low-ω window. Interesting and reproducible are also nontrivial spectral shapes
as the sharp peak close to ω < 0 and a broad shoulder for ω  0. Most important is,

however, the evident pseudogap (observed also experimentally in cuprates) visible
at ω ∼ 0 in the low-doping regime.
Besides the challenging models for cuprates there have been also studies of static
and dynamical properties of multiband and multiorbital models which either reduce
to the generalized t-J model [38] or to Kondo lattice models [39–41] and the FalicovKimball model [42]. While the increasing number of local basis states K clearly limits
the applicability of ED-based methods, they are competitive in treating nontrivial
frustrated spin models less suitable for the QMC and other methods, however closely
related to physics of novel materials. Moreover, frustrated models are characterized
by a large entropy density s and related low T f s essential conditions for feasibility of
FTLM results. Examples of such systems are the Shastry-Sutherland model [43, 44],
2D J1 -J2 model [45], and properties of frustrated magnetic molecules [46–48].
Another class of problems which can be quite effectively dealt with the FTLM and
MCLM approaches is the fundamental as well as experimentally relevant problem
of transport in 1D systems of interacting fermions as realized, e.g., in quasi-1D
spin-chain materials [49]. It has been recognized that the transport response at any
T > 0 crucially differs between integrable and nonintegrable systems. Since the 1D
isotropic as well as anisotropic Heisenberg model, Eq. (1.1), is integrable it opens a
variety of fundamental questions of anomalous transport in such systems, the effects
of perturbative terms and impurities. Such fundamental questions on transport and
low-ω dynamic response remain nontrivial even at high T [21, 22], hence the MCLM
is the most feasible and straightforward method. It has been in fact first probed on the
anomalous transport in 1D insulators [50] but further on used to study interactioninduced transport at T > 0 in disordered 1D systems [51, 52], incoherent transport
induced by a single either static [53] or dynamical spin impurity [54].
In Fig. 1.6 we present as an example the MCLM result for the dynamical spin
conductivity in the anisotropic Heisenberg model, Eq. (1.1), where J zz = J x x =
J yy = J in the Ising-like (with the spin gap in the g.s.) regime Δ = J zz /J > 1.

Fig. 1.6 High-T dynamical spin conductivity T σ (ω) within the anisotropic Heisenberg model in
the Ising-like regime Δ = 1.5 and various next-neighbor interaction α = J2zz /J as calculated with
the MCLM on a chain with N = 30 sites

Results for the high-T dynamical spin conductivity T σ (ω) are shown for various
next-neighbor (anisotropic) coupling α = J2zz /J . First message is that the MCLM as
the method is well adapted for the high ω resolution (here using M1 = M2 = 2000)
and reaching large N = 30 (Nst ∼ 5.106 in a single S z = 0, q sector). Another
conclusion is that the dynamics of such systems is very anomalous. For the integrable
case α = 0 we find σ0 = σ (0) ∼ 0 but also an anomalous finite-size peak at
ω p ∝ 1/N [50]. At the same time breaking integrability with α > 0 appears to
lead to σ0 > 0 still approaching an ‘ideal’ insulator (insulating at all T ) for a weak
perturbation σ0 (α → 0) → 0 [55].

1.5 Reduced Basis Lanczos Methods
The main shortcoming of ED approaches are finite-size effects that tamper calculations on small lattice systems. Exponentially growing Hilbert spaces represent the
main obstacle against extending ED calculations to larger lattices. One way to extend
ED calculations is to reduce the complete Hilbert space and keep only states that give
a significant weight in the g.s. wavefunction or in the relevant Hilbert space, e.g., at
T > 0. Here, the crucial step represents developing a feasible algorithm for the basis
reduction.
One clear example of very effective basis construction is the DMRG method,
most feasible for 1D correlated systems. Within this method, described in other
chapters, some intermediate steps of ED diagonalization are frequently also performed via Lanczos iterations [56]. Moreover, there are recently developments which
are extending the application of DMRG procedure to T > 0 dynamical response
[57, 58] involving more directly features of Lanczos-based approaches. In particular, recent finite-T dynamical DMRG (FTD-DMRG) method [58] combines the
DMRG selection of MB states and the LTLM procedure as described in Sect. 1.4.3

1 Ground State and Finite Temperature Lanczos Methods

23

and in Eqs. (1.42), (1.43) to evaluate dynamical correlations at T > 0, both being
effective at low T . So far the FTD-DMRG method has been applied to find novel
features within the 1D J1 -J2 model [59].
The ideas to find the reduced basis sets is, however, more general going beyond the
1D systems and has been successful in solving several problems of strongly correlated
systems. Even before the discovery of high-Tc superconductors that boosted research
on models of correlated systems, Brinkman and Rice [60] developed a string representation of configurational space to compute the band renormalization and mobility
in the atomic limit of the Hubbard model. The string picture was later used to compute single hole properties and to estimate hole-pair binding within the t-J model
by many authors [61–63]. In connection with ED calculations on finite lattices the
truncation scheme based on the limitation of the maximal length of strings leads to
slow convergence in terms of the number of reduced basis states [64] in the spinisotropic limit of the t-J model. Rather slow convergence is achieved also using a
cluster diagonalization scheme together with the systematic expansion of the Hilbert
space [65, 66].
The exact diagonalization method in limited functional space (EDLFS) was originally developed specifically for solving the problem of a single charge carrier (hole)
doped in the AFM background [67]. The basic principle of the method is based
on the above mentioned string picture, that emerges as a moving hole through the
AFM background creates in its wake paths of overturned spins-strings. EDLFS was
later generalized to include phonon degrees of freedom [68, 69]. For the purpose of
presenting the method we start by considering the prototype t-J model, Eq. (1.2),
coupled to dispersionless optical phonons on a square lattice

where t represents
the nearest-neighbor hopping, ai is the phonon annihilation oper
ator, n i = s n is and all double sums run over the nearest neighbor pairs. The third
term represents electron–phonon coupling g and the last the energy of Einstein-type
phonons ω0 .
The Néel state is the g.s. of the model when t = γ = g = 0. We construct the
limited functional space (LFS) for one hole starting from a Néel state on an infinite
2D lattice with a hole placed in the origin and zero phonon degrees of freedom
|φ0  = c0 |Néel;0. We then proceed with the generation of new states, using the
following generator

where Ht and Hg are off-diagonal terms in Eq. (1.48), respectively. We select
n s = 1, Ns and a fixed value of m. This procedure generates strings with maximum lengths given by Ns and phonon quanta at a maximal distance Ns − 1 from
the hole. Parameter m provides the creation of additional phonon quanta leading to a
maximum number of phonons N ph = m Ns in the system. Typically, larger N ph are
necessary to achieve convergence in the strong electron–phonon coupling (polaron)
regime. While constructing LFS we take into account explicitly translational symmetry. I.e., we store only one out of (in principle) infinitely many translationally
invariant states, called a parent state. However, the Néel state is a state with a broken translational symmetry so allowed translations are generated by two minimal
translations r1,2 = (1, ±1). The basis wavefunctions are represented by one of the
two nonequivalent hole positions rh , sets of strings, representing overturned spins
relative to the Néel state (spin flips), and occupation numbers representing excited
phonon quanta,
|φ = |rh ; r1 , r2 , . . . , r N f l ; n r1 , n r2 , . . . , n rN ,
s

(1.50)

where ri represent spin-flip coordinates, n rj number of phonon quanta at site rj and
N f l ≤ Ns is the total number of spin flips.
Since the Hilbert space grows exponentially with Ns there exist many intuitive
physically motivated restrictions optimizing LFS’s for different parameter regimes
to slow down the exponential growth. A systematic control over the growing Hilbert
space can be achieved through realization that the diagonal energy of long strings
grows linearly with Ns . Assuming that the contribution of long strings in the g.s.
wave-function is negligible, we introduce an additional parameter Nb ≤ Ns that
restricts generation of long strings by imposing a condition under which all coordinates of spin flips satisfy |μh − μ f | ≤ Nb ; μ = {x, y} where h and f refer to
hole and spin-flip indexes, respectively. Application of this condition improves the
quality of the LFS by increasing the number of states containing spin flips in the
vicinity of the hole while keeping the total amount of states within computationally
accessible limits.
Figure 1.7 represents a particular state generated using Eq. (1.49). Black and grey
dots represent sites with spins ‘up’ and ‘down’, respectively. The hole starts at the
position (−1, 1) in the direction (0, −1), and travels along the path indicated by
arrows. Crosses represent spin-flips and numbers represent excited phonon quanta,
generated along the hole’s path. The effect of the parameter m is to set the maximal
number of excited phonon quanta on indicated positions. In this particular parent
the hole ends its path on the B-sublattice. Using allowed minimal translations, the
position of the hole in the parent state is at rh = (1, 0).
After the generation of LFS the full Hamiltonian in Eq. (1.48) is diagonalized
within this LFS using the standard Lanczos procedure. The efficiency of the EDLFS
method in case of the t-J model and stability of results against varying Ns and Nb
has been shown in detail in Ref. [67].

Fig. 1.7 Schematic representation of a particular basis wavefunction obtained using Ns = 10,
m = 3, and Nb = 3. Circle represents the hole position, crosses, portray spin flips and numbers
indicated excited phonon quanta. Dots represent lattice sites with no spin flips and zero excited
phonon quanta. In this particular case, N f l = 5 and N p = 8. Presented basis function is one of a
total of Nst = 42.106 states, generated using Eq. (1.49)

Besides reliable results obtained using the EDLFS there are other important advantages over most other methods: (a) it is highly efficient, (b) the method is free of
finite-size effects, (c) it treats spin and lattice degrees of freedom on the same footing while preserving the full quantum nature of the problem, and (d) it allows for
computation of physical properties at an arbitrary wavevector. Even though results
depend on the choice of parameters defining the functional generator in Eq. (1.49),
such as Ns and m, reliable results are obtained already for relatively small sizes of the
Hilbert space Nst , typically up to three orders of magnitude smaller than in the case
of exact diagonalization techniques. For most static as well as dynamic quantities
convergence to the thermodynamic limit can be achieved with a systematic increase
of Ns and m.
The EDLFS obviously has few limitations: (a) the method is limited to calculations
in the zero-doping limit, e.g., Nh = 1, 2 mobile particles immersed in an infinite
(AFM) background, (b) the spin anisotropy is inherently built in the method, and (c)
due to the broken translational symmetry of the starting wavefunction, calculations
are limited to the reduced AFM Brillouin zone.
Due to its high efficiency in dealing with spin fluctuation the method represents one
of the few successful methods that allows the addition of lattice degrees of freedom to
a correlated electron model. The EDLFS handles spin and lattice degrees of freedom
by preserving the full quantum mechanical nature of the problem and enables a direct
calculation of the dynamic response functions in terms of real frequency ω.
The EDLFS can be rather in a straightforward way generalized for the study of
the two-hole Nh = 2 problem [70, 71]. ED studies in the t-J model for Nh = 2 were
performed on a 2D square lattices up to N = 32 sites [72, √
73]. Still, the maximal
distance between two holes remains rather small lmax = N /2 = 4. Attempts
to increase the lattices sizes beyond ED studies led authors to investigate various
truncated basis approaches [64–66] and using small sets of variational wavefunctions
with given rotational symmetries based on ‘string’ and ‘spin-bag’ pictures [74].

26

While the problem of two holes within the t-J model represents a challenging problem, the addition of quantum phonons seems an almost unachievable task.
Nevertheless, the EDLFS due to an efficient choice of LFS can handle this problem
well. The construction of the LFS starts from a Néel state with holes located on
neighboring sites and with zero phonon quanta. Such a state represents a parent state
of a translationally invariant state. We generate new parent states in analogy with
Eq. (1.49) by applying the generator of states

where H̃ J denotes the off-diagonal spin exchange term in Eq. (1.48) applied only to
erase spin flips generated through application of Ht . This allows the creation of states
with holes positioned further apart that are not connected with spin strings. Note that
for larger Ns ≥ 6 some of such states would be generated even without evoking
H̃ J term via the Trugman loops [61–63]. One of the advantages of this method in
comparison to other approaches is that it allows much larger distances between the
holes, lmax = Ns + 1. Note also that the functional generator preserves as well the
point-group symmetry.

phonon coupling λ = g 2 /8ω0 t = 0, the maximal allowed distance between holes
is lmax = 13 while for λ = 0.25 lmax = 7, whereby results for λ = 0 are consistent
with previous findings using ED [72, 73], reduced-basis ED [65, 66], as well as
string picture variational approaches [74].

1.6 Real Time Dynamics Using Lanczos Method
Research in the field of non-equilibrium dynamics of complex quantum systems
constitutes a formidable theoretical challenge. When dealing with ED approaches or
calculations in the reduced basis, the time evolution of the time-dependent Shrödinger
equation,
∂Ψ (t)
= H (t)Ψ (t),
(1.53)
i
∂t
can be efficiently obtained using the time-dependent Lanczos technique, as originally
described in Ref. [75] and later applied and analysed in more detail [76]. One of
the straightforward reasons is that most commonly the Lanczos method is used
to compute g.s. of MB Hamiltonian. Generalizing the method to time-dependent
calculation represents only a minor change to already existing codes. Even though the
method is most suitable for the time evolution of the time-independent Hamiltonian,
it can nevertheless be applied even to the time-dependent case. The time evolution
of |Ψ (t) is then calculated by step-vise change of time t in small time increments
δt, generating at each step Lanczos basis of dimension M (typically M < 10), to
follow the evolution

e−il δt |ψl ψl |Ψ (t),

l=1

where |ψl , l , l = 0 . . . M are Lanczos eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, respectively, obtained via the Lanczos iteration started with |φ0  = |Ψ (t). The advantage
of the time-evolution method following Eq. (1.54) is that it preserves the normalization of |Ψ (t + δt) for arbitrary large δt. The approximation of finite M in Eq. (1.54)
is also correct at least to the Mth Taylor-expansion order in δt. It is, however, important to stress that δt should be chosen small enough to take into account properly
the time-dependence of H (t). E.g., in the case of driving the system with an external constant electric field, δt/t B ∼ 10−3 where t B is the Bloch oscillation period
[55, 77–79].
So far, investigations of correlated driven systems under the influence of a driving
electric field in 1D systems using the Lanczos time evolution method focused on
generic systems, like the metallic and Mott-insulating regime within the 1D model
of interacting spinless fermions [55, 77]. Even though rather small systems can be
studied it has been established that steady state can be reached without any additional
coupling to a heat bath, provided that the Joule heating of the system is properly taken
into account.
The case of a single charge carrier in an inelastic medium driven by the external
electric field in 1D as well as 2D has been investigated using EDLFS combined with
a Lanczos-based time-evolution approach [77, 79–82]. The strength of EDLFS is in
construction of the Hilbert space that enables not only an accurate description of the
ground state of the single carrier system but it allows for enough extra inelastic (spin

28

or phonon) excitations to absorb energy, emitted by the field driven carrier, until the
system reaches the steady state. This again enables a proper description of the steady
state without coupling the system to an external thermal bath.

1.7 Discussion
Exact diagonalization based methods, both the full ED and Lanczos-type ED
approach, are very extensively employed in the investigations of strongly correlated
MB quantum systems in solid state and elsewhere. The reason for their widespread
use are several: (a) unbiased approach to the MB problem without any simplifications or approximations, independent of complexity of the MB system, (b) relative
simplicity of generating the codes for various models and observables, (c) easy and
straightforward testing of codes, (d) direct interpretation of obtained quantum MB
states and their possible anomalous structure and properties, (e) high pedagogical
impact as a quick and at the same time very nontrivial introduction into the nature
of MB quantum physics. Also the Lanczos-based methods described in this review,
i.e., the g.s. Lanczos method for static and dynamic quantities, and somewhat more
elaborate FTLM, MCLM, LTLM and EDLFS, require rather modest programming
efforts in comparison with more complex numerical methods, e.g., the QMC- and
DMRG- based methods, as described in other chapters.
Clearly, the main drawback of ED methods is the smallness of lattice sizes N
determined by a limited number of basis states (at present Nst < 109 ) treated with a
Lanczos iteration procedure. The achievable N with ED methods appears quite modest in comparison with some established and recently developed numerical methods,
as the QMC, DMRG, matrix-product-states methods etc. Still, in spite of very intensive development and advance of novel numerical methods in last two decades there
are several aspects of strong-correlation physics, where ED-based methods are so
far either the only feasible or at least superior to other methods. In this chapter we
have focused mostly on Lanczos-based methods and applications where they are still
competitive and get nontrivial results with a macroscopic validity:
(a) MB g.s. and its properties of frustrated and complex models mostly so far do not
offer alternative powerful methods except ED approaches, at least beyond D = 1
systems where DMRG-based methods can be effectively applied,
(b) T > 0 static properties evaluated with Lanczos-based methods as the FTLM and
the LTLM are as well most powerful and reliable for frustrated and complex system,
in particular in systems with high degeneracies of MB states and large entropy at
low T ,
(c) T > 0 Lanczos methods for dynamical quantities, as the FTLM and MCLM,
yield for many models and geometries results superior to other methods or even
the only accessible results in several cases. In particular the advantage of the latter
methods is high ω resolution at all temperatures beyond the finite size limit T > T f s ,
the macroscopic-like results at low T with a proper scaling to T → 0, and the

1 Ground State and Finite Temperature Lanczos Methods

29

possibility of detailed studies of systems with nontrivial (anomalous) dynamics at
any, in particular high T .
(d) Lanczos technique of ED is also the natural application within the methods with
a restricted MB basis sets as the EDLFS and DMRG-type targeting as well as in the
real-time evolution studies of strongly correlated systems.
