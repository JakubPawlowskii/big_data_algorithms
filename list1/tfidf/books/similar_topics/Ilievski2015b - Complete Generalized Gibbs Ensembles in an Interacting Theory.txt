In integrable many-particle systems, it is widely believed that the stationary state reached at late times
after a quantum quench can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) constructed from their
extensive number of conserved charges. A crucial issue is then to identify a complete set of these charges,
enabling the GGE to provide exact steady-state predictions. Here we solve this long-standing problem for
the case of the spin-1=2 Heisenberg chain by explicitly constructing a GGE which uniquely fixes the
macrostate describing the stationary behavior after a general quantum quench. A crucial ingredient in our
method, which readily generalizes to other integrable models, are recently discovered quasilocal charges.
As a test, we reproduce the exact postquench steady state of the Néel quench problem obtained previously
by means of the Quench Action method.

Introduction.—Understanding and describing the equilibration of isolated many-particle systems is one of the main
current challenges of quantum physics. The presence of
higher conserved charges (above the Hamiltonian) is linked
to the absence of full relaxation to a thermalized state; the
conjectured appropriate framework to characterize the
steady-state properties in such a situation is the generalized
Gibbs ensemble (GGE) [1], in which all available charges are
ascribed an individual “chemical potential” set by the initial
conditions, and the steady state is the maximal entropy state
fulfilling all the constraints associated to the conserved
charges [2–27]. The basic idea underlying the GGE is as
follows. Let H ≃ Hð1Þ be the Hamiltonian of an integrable
model, and fHðnÞ g a set of conserved charges fulfilling
½HðnÞ ; HðmÞ  ¼ 0. The situation we are interested in is that
of a quantum quench, where we initially prepare our system
in the ground state jΨð0Þi of a local Hamiltonian H0 and
then consider unitary time evolution with respect to our
integrable Hamiltonian
jΨðtÞi ¼ e−iHt jΨð0Þi:

ð1Þ

We assume that we are dealing with a generic case where, in
the thermodynamic limit, jΨð0Þi cannot be expressed as a
linear combination of any finite number of eigenstates of H.
At late times after the quench expectation values of local
operators approach stationary values
hOiΨ ¼ lim hΨðtÞjOjΨðtÞi:
t→∞

ð2Þ

The GGE hypothesis asserts that these expectation values can
be calculated as hOiΨ ¼ Trðϱ̂GGE OÞ from a statistical
ensemble with a density matrix

where N is the system size and limth denotes the thermodynamic limit N → ∞. Equation (4) is a direct consequence of
the fact that HðnÞ are conserved charges. While the GGE
hypothesis has been successfully verified for many systems
mappable to free particles, in interacting theories such as the
spin-1=2 Heisenberg XXZ chain the question of precisely
which charges need to be included in Eq. (3) arises. In
Refs. [17,18,20] a GGE based on the known conserved local
charges [28] was constructed and used to determine steadystate averages of observables [20]. Subsequent analyses
[21,22] by the Quench Action (QA) approach [14] demonstrated that this GGE fails to predict the correct steady-state
properties. This failure was shown to be related to the
existence of bound states [21] (see also [29,30]), which are
known to be a generic feature in quantum integrable models.
These results posed the question of whether the GGE is
conceptually faulty, or whether there could exist hitherto
unknown charges that need to be taken into account in its
construction.
In this Letter, we settle this issue by explicitly showing
how to repair the GGE in Heisenberg chains, by complementing it with recently discovered additional families of
conserved charges [31]. Crucially, these “quasilocal”
charges fulfil a weaker form of locality than the previously
known ones. We derive a set of fundamental identities
between the initial-state expectation values of these
charges, and the density functions characterizing the steady
state. An explicit test of our construction is provided by a
quantum quench from the Néel state to the XXZ chain: we

demonstrate that our GGE correctly recovers the stationary
state, the form of which is known exactly from the QA
approach [21,32]. In this way we completely resolve the
above-mentioned conundrum. Our construction shows
that quasilocal conserved charges are in fact crucial for
understanding the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum
integrable models.

Given the GGE density matrix, a “microcanonical”
description of the steady state can be obtained by performing a generalized Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz [11,38];
see Supplemental Material for a brief summary [37]. This

Within the generalized Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
formalism macrostates can be described either by root
densities of particles, or by densities of holes. Holes can be,
loosely speaking, understood as analogues of unoccupied
states in models of free fermions. In terms of the latter the

GGE i is parametrized in terms of the set of positive

functions fρΨ

data, Eq. (4), directly determines the hole density of 1strings (i.e., vacancies of unbound states), according to the
remarkable identity

All other hole densities are fixed by the maximum entropy

Quench action treatment.—The above GGE treatment
should be compared to an independent calculation using the
QA method [14]. For a generic quench problem, given an
initial state jΨ0 i, the time-dependent expectation value of a
generic local observable O can be expressed as a double
Hilbert space summation

where Sλ ¼ − ln hλjΨ0 i. Here, jλi are eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian driving the postquench time evolution.
Exploiting the fact that in the thermodynamic limit, the
summation over eigenstates can be written as a functional
integral over root densities, which can be evaluated in a
saddle-point approximation (becoming exact in the thermodynamic limit), one finds, in particular, that the steady-state

real part of the overlap coefficient in the thermodynamic
limit and SYY ½ρ is the Yang-Yang entropy of the state
[28,35,36]. For the Néel to XXZ quench, the exact overlaps
were obtained in [39] and used in [21,32] to obtain the
0
exact saddle-point densities ρΨ
QA representing the steady

state. Crucially, one finds [21,22] that ρΨ
GGE ≠ ρQA , which
in turn leads to different predictions for physical properties
such as spin-spin correlators. This demonstrated that the
ultralocal GGE does not correctly describe the steady state
after a generic quantum quench in the XXZ chain.
Constructing a quasilocal GGE.—Very recently [31]
(see also [40–45]) hitherto unknown conserved charges of
the isotropic (Δ ¼ 1) Heisenberg model were discovered.
These operators are not local in the sense that they cannot
be represented as a spatially homogeneous sum of finitely
supported densities, but rather quasilocal, meaning [31] that
their Hilbert–Schmidt norms scale linearly with system size
and their overlaps with locally supported operators become
independent of N in the limit of large system size.
Moreover, they are linearly independent from the known
local charges generated from the spin-1=2 transfer matrix.
Until now, the impact of these charges on local physical
observables has not been quantified.
Our first step is to construct a family of quasilocal
conserved charges for Δ ≥ 1 by generalizing the procedure
of [31]. The starting point is the q-deformed L operator,

Here the root distributions characterizing the stationary
state have been previously determined by a QA calculation
[21,32]. In order to demonstrate that our GGE recovers
these known results we need to compute the generating
functions, Eq. (25). Here we can repeat the logical steps
from the calculation for s ¼ 1=2 in [18,20] by studying the
spectrum of associated auxiliary transfer matrices. This
calculation can be found in the Supplemental Material [37].
Substituting the results obtained in this way into Eq. (24)
gives perfect agreement with the known QA results.
Towards a truncated GGE.—In [10] it was argued that for
the purpose of describing finite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit ultralocal GGEs can be truncated by retaining
only a finite number of the “most local” conserved charges.
An obvious question is whether a similar logic can be applied
to our quasilocal GGE. As a first step towards understanding
this issue, we have calculated the next-nearest spin correlation function in the steady state after a Néel-to-XXZ quench
for several GGEs truncated in the s direction. In Fig. 1 we
show the results of these calculations for Δ ≳ 1. The data
clearly show that adding subsequent families of quasilocal
charges results in a rapid convergence of the corresponding
truncated GGE result to the exact value.
Conclusions.—We have shown how to construct an exact
GGE describing the stationary state after generic quantum
quenches to the spin-1=2 Heisenberg XXZ chain. Our GGE
is built from an extended set of local and quasilocal
charges. We have shown that our construction resolves

previously observed discrepancies between predictions for
steady-state expectation values by an exact QA treatment
on the one hand, and a GGE restricted to ultralocal charges
obtained from the transfer matrix of the spin-1=2 chain on
the other hand. Our results provide unambiguous proof that
the recently discovered quasilocal charges have a nonnegligible impact on the relaxation processes of strongly
interacting many-body quantum systems in one dimension.
