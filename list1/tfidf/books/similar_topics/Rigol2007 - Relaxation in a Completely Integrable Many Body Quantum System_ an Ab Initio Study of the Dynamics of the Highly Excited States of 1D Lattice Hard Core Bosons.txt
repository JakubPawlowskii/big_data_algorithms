In this Letter we pose the question of whether a many-body quantum system with a full set of conserved
quantities can relax to an equilibrium state, and, if it can, what the properties of such a state are. We confirm the relaxation hypothesis through an ab initio numerical investigation of the dynamics of hard-core
bosons on a one-dimensional lattice. Further, a natural extension of the Gibbs ensemble to integrable
systems results in a theory that is able to predict the mean values of physical observables after relaxation.
Finally, we show that our generalized equilibrium carries more memory of the initial conditions than the
usual thermodynamic one. This effect may have many experimental consequences, some of which have
already been observed in the recent experiment on the nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional hardcore bosons in a harmonic potential [T. Kinoshita et al., Nature (London) 440, 900 (2006)].

Introduction.—Integrable quantum gases traditionally
belong to the domain of mathematical physics, with little
or no connection to experiments. However, the experimental work on confined quantum-degenerate gases has recently yielded faithful realizations of a number of
integrable one-dimensional many-body systems, thus making them phenomenologically relevant. Examples include
the gas of hard-core bosons (Girardeau) [1–3], realized in
[4]; its lattice version [5] studied in our Letter, realized in
[6]; finite-strength s-wave-interacting spin-0 bosons (Lieb,
Liniger, and McGuire) [7,8], realized in [9–11] in the
mean-field regime and in [12,13] in the regime of interactions of intermediate strength; and spin- 12 fermions
(Yang-Gaudin) [14], realized in [15]. The list has a potential to grow to include also the fermionic p-wave version of
hard-core particles [16,17]; the gas of 1=r2 interacting
atoms (Calogero and Sutherland) [18,19]; and the gas of
fermions on a lattice (Fermi and Hubbard) [20]. The experiment [6]—which is a realization of the system whose
time dynamics we study in the present Letter —used an
optical lattice in the tight-binding regime [21,22]. The
technique was originally developed to reach the
superfluid–Mott-insulator transition [23] as achieved in
[24]. We should also mention the experimental studies [25]
of a related nonintegrable system, the one-dimensional
lattice bosons with finite coupling.
An integrable model possesses many nontrivial integrals
of motion, and it is natural to wonder what consequences
this fact may have for time dynamics and kinetics. Perhaps
the best known theoretical efforts in this vein are the
attempts to explain the suppression of equilibration in the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chains by the closeness to various integrable models (see [26] for a review). Another research
direction concerns the effects of integrals of motion on the
0031-9007=07=98(5)=050405(4)

autocorrelation properties of large systems, first studied in
[27,28] and later specialized to spin systems [29,30]. More
recent are the studies of the onset of thermalization in a
large quantum system [31,32], and, in particular, in a
mesoscopic-size Lieb-Liniger gas [33].
The major inspiration for our work—underlying especially Fig. 2 below—is the recent experiment on the
nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional hard-core
bosons in a harmonic potential performed at Penn State
University [34]. There it was found that hard-core bosons
do not relax to the usual state of thermodynamic equilibrium. The question that intrigued us is whether nevertheless there exists some kind of equilibrium state to which a
many-body integrable system relaxes in the course of time
evolution from even a highly nonequilibrium initial state —
and, if so, how to predict mean values of physical observables in such a state.
Generalized Gibbs ensemble.—We start with the latter
question, for now simply assuming that an equilibrium
state exists. We conjecture that then the standard prescription of statistical mechanics applies: one should maximize
the many-body entropy S  kB Tr ln1=, subject to
the constraints imposed by all the integrals of motion.
This results in the following many-body density matrix:

grand-canonical ensemble in the case of a generic system,
where the only integrals of motion are the total energy, the
number of particles, and, for periodic systems, the total
momentum. Conceptually, the ensemble (1) is close to the
one E. T. Jaynes introduced in 1957 in the context of the socalled ‘‘subjective statistical mechanics’’ [35]. Girardeau
used Jaynes’s concept to study the relaxation of magnetization in the XY model [36]. Below we test the predictive
power of (1) and (2) on the example of hard-core bosons on
a one-dimensional lattice, a system integrable via JordanWigner mapping to free fermions.

Here b^i (b^yi ) is the annihilation (creation) operator for
hard-core bosons, and J is the hopping constant. For our
theoretical predictions we use a periodic lattice (b^L1 
b^1 ). However, the subsequent numerical studies are performed for the more experimentally relevant hard-wall
boundary conditions. For sufficiently large lattice sizes L,
the difference between real physical quantities calculated
using these two settings is negligible [37].

The values of the Lagrange multipliers k must be fixed

stated above, the density matrix given by (8) is assumed to
predict correctly the values of the system’s observables
after a complete relaxation from an initial state with the

Below, we test this conjecture numerically, using the bosonic (quasi-)momentum distribution as the figure of merit.
Numerical tests.—In order to verify our predictions we
perform two series of textbooklike numerical experiments
on the relaxation of an ensemble of hard-core bosons on a
lattice from a highly nonequilibrium state. We have chosen

to study lattices in which the final size L  N, i.e., the
average interparticle distance is much larger than the lattice spacing, so that our results are also of relevance to
continuous systems [5]. The numerical technique has been
described elsewhere [38].
In the first series we prepare our gas in the ground state
of a hard-wall box, then let the gas expand to a larger
box. For all sizes of the initial box, we find that the
(quasi-)momentum distribution indeed converges to an almost time independent distribution (see Fig. 1). Next, we
compare the result after relaxation with the predictions of
standard statistical mechanics and of the fully constrained
ensemble (1) and (8). We find that the fully constrained
thermodynamics stands in an exceptional agreement with
the results of the dynamical propagation. (See [39] for
further details of the thermal algorithm.) The accuracy of
the above predictions has been successfully verified for the
whole range of available values of the size of the initial
box, from Lin:  N  30 through Lin:  L  600.
In the second series (Fig. 2) we study the effects of the
memory of the initial conditions that is stored in the fully
constrained ensemble (1) and (8). Our setting is very
similar to an actual experiment on relaxation of an ensemble of hard-core bosons in a harmonic potential [34].
There the momentum distribution was initially split into
two peaks. After many periods of oscillation, no appreciable relaxation to a single-bell distribution was observed.
In our case the system is initially in the ground state of a
superlattice (spatially periodic background potential, see
[40] for details) with period 4,

propagation time, the four characteristic peaks in the
(quasi-)momentum distribution remain well resolved,
although their shape is modified in the course of the
propagation. Our interpretation of both experimental and
numerical results is as follows: if the initial (quasi)momentum distribution consists of several well-separated
peaks, the memory of the initial distribution that is stored
in the ensemble (1) prevents the peaks from overlapping,
no matter how long the propagation time. Note also that the
residual broadening of the peaks seen in Fig. 2 is beyond
the experimental accuracy in [34].
Summary.—We have demonstrated that an integrable
many-body quantum system—one-dimensional hard-core
bosons on a lattice —can undergo relaxation to an equilibrium state. The properties of this state are governed by the
usual laws of statistical physics, properly updated to accommodate all the integrals of motion. We further show
that our generalized equilibrium state carries more memory
of the initial conditions than the usual thermodynamic one.
It is in the light of that observation that we interpret the
results of the recent experiment on the nonequilibrium
